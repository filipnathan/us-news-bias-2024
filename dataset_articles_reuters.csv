Takeaways from the US presidential election,"Nov 6 (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump was on the verge of a convincing win over Democrat Kamala Harris in the U.S. presidential election, avenging his own loss to President Joe Biden four years ago.
How did Trump pull it off? He had the fortune of running when Americans were frustrated by high prices and, to a lesser extent, illegal immigration across the U.S. southern border.

Those were Trump's signature issues, ones that proved to be anvils that weighed down Vice President Harris' candidacy. The result was a quicker-than-expected set of returns that placed Trump on the cusp of securing the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.


Here are some takeaways from the exit polls and results:
TOUGH SLEDDING
The national exit poll of voters conducted by Edison Research underscored what public opinion surveys had long shown: Voters are in a bad mood and have been for some time.
Three-fourths of voters surveyed by Edison said the country was going in a negative direction. Of those voters, 61% went for Trump. Of the voters who called themselves ""angry,"" 71% backed the Republican.

Voters who said the economy was their top concern broke 79% to 20% for Trump, according the poll.
Voters who believe abortion should be a legal procedure in most instances surprisingly only backed Harris 51% to 47%, suggesting Trump's efforts to blur his position may have partially negated one of her largest advantages.
Trump said he opposed a federal abortion ban but that states are free to pass laws as restricted or unrestricted as they choose. He also became a vocal advocate for having insurers cover the cost of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, treatments.

Perhaps most notably for Harris, the three-fourths of voters who said they felt U.S. democracy was ""threatened"" split their vote evenly between the two candidates.
While Democrats have pointed to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election as proof of his authoritarian tendencies, Trump has argued he was a target for politically minded prosecutors in the Biden administration.
TREND LINES As the evening progressed, Harris and Trump each prevailed in the early states they had been expected to win. Trump's lead in electoral votes continued to build.

Edison Research projected Trump would win the battleground states of Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, while Fox News projected Trump to be the winner of the election. Other news organizations had not yet called the election.
As Trump drew near to an official victory, there were some emerging trends that helped illustrate how he did it.
Though many blocs of voters were supporting the Democratic or Republican candidate in similar numbers to 2020, according to the exit polls, Trump was showing greater strength with male voters of color and with voters under 45 compared to four years ago.

He also appeared to be holding onto enough women supporters in America's suburbs to prevail despite Harris' best attempts to pull them away. The national exit poll showed Trump with a 51% to 47% edge with suburban white women voters.
VOTERS OF COLOR
The Trump campaign put a great deal of effort into persuading Black and Latino voters to defect from the Democratic Party – and there were some indications those efforts paid off.
In North Carolina, exit polls showed Trump boosting his share of the Black vote to 12%, from 5% in 2020. He garnered the support of 20% of Black male voters, the poll said.
According to the Edison national poll, Trump's support among Latino male voters jumped 18 percentage points from four years ago.
Trump was up 11 percentage points with Latino voters in Nevada, according to the poll, and up 4 points in Arizona from four years ago. He was on track to do as well or better than Republican President George W. Bush did 20 years ago, when Bush garnered 44% of Hispanic voters.
Trump was projected to win in North Carolina despite exit polls showing a 5-point slide in support among white voters compared with four years ago.
In Pennsylvania, Trump's support among white voters dropped 3 percentage points compared with four years ago, Edison said – and his support was down 4 points among white male voters.
But he was able to make up for that drop in support by picking up voters of color.
A GENDER GAP?
Harris’ campaign was looking to exploit a large gender gap in the electorate, with the hope that legions of women voters would flock to the vice president because of issues such as abortion rights.
But Trump seemed to hold onto the support of at least white women voters, according to exit polls. Black women overwhelmingly supported Harris.
In Pennsylvania, Trump was maintaining close to the same level of support among white women voters that he enjoyed in 2020. That was also true in Georgia.
Trump's campaign, conversely, paid significant attention to pulling in male voters, particularly young men, through social media, sports, podcasts and online gaming.
National exit polls showed Harris picking up less support among women – 54% – than Biden did in 2020 when he received 57%.
AN AGE GAP
The national exit poll showed Trump slightly edging Harris among men between the ages of 18 and 44 and beating her solidly with men 45 and up.
In Michigan and Wisconsin, Trump was up 5 percentage points with overall voters under 45 compared with four years ago. In Nevada, he jumped 6 points with those voters.
Trump won new voters, a relatively small share of the electorate, by 9 percentage points over Harris.
But at the same time, Trump appeared to be losing ground with older voters, according to the polls.
In Wisconsin, Trump's share of voters 65 and older fell 11 points from 2020. In Michigan, he fell 6 points.
Trump won the 65-and-over vote over Biden in 2020 by 3 percentage points. In the Edison national poll for 2024, Harris and Trump were essentially tied.

"Exclusive: Harris lead over Trump dwindles to a single point, 44% to 43%, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds","WASHINGTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Kamala Harris' lead over Donald Trump dwindled in the final stretch of the U.S. presidential contest, with the Democrat ahead by a single percentage point over the Republican, 44% to 43%, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday.
The three-day poll, completed on Sunday, showed the race effectively tied ahead of the Nov. 5 election. The poll had a margin of error of about three percentage points in either direction.

While Harris has led Trump in every Reuters/Ipsos poll of registered voters since she entered the race in July, her lead has steadily shrunk since late September. A prior Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Oct. 16-21 showed Harris, the current U.S. vice president, with a two-point lead over former President Trump.
The new poll, which surveyed 1,150 U.S. adults nationwide, including 975 registered voters, showed Trump with significant advantages over Harris on several of the issues voters consider most pressing.

Asked which of the two candidates had a better approach to the economy, unemployment and jobs, voters in the poll picked Trump 47% to 37%. Trump has had an edge on the economy throughout the campaign and 26% of voters in the latest poll cited jobs and the economy as the country's most pressing problem, compared to 24% who cited political extremism and 18% who pointed to immigration.
Trump's biggest edge in terms of policy could be on immigration issues, where he has put forward hardline proposals that include mass deportations of migrants in the country illegally. Some 48% of voters in the latest poll said Trump's approach to immigration was best, higher than the 33% who picked Harris.

The poll also showed Harris' advantage on the issue of political extremism to be dwindling. Some 40% of voters in the poll said she had a better approach to handling political extremism and threats to democracy, compared to 38% who picked Trump. Harris' two-point lead on the issue compared to her seven-point lead over Trump on extremism the Oct 16-21 poll.
Harris has emphasized Trump's role in the Jan 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, who aimed to overturn his 2020 election defeat, and on Tuesday is making what her campaign billed as her last major pre-election speech before the election at the site where Trump rallied his supporters before the riot.


Trump has hit back with an argument that Harris' views are extreme and would amount to a socialist takeover of U.S. institutions.
Harris' marginal lead over Trump might not be enough to win the election even if it holds through Nov 5.
National surveys, including Reuters/Ipsos polls, give important signals on the views of the electorate, but the state-by-state results of the Electoral College determine the winner, with seven battleground states likely to be decisive.
Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, triumphing in the Electoral College even though she won the national popular vote by two points.
Polls have shown Harris and Trump are neck and neck in those battleground states as well.
Given the close match, the candidates' efforts to ensure that their supporters actually cast ballots will likely be key in determining the winner.
Just two-thirds of U.S. adults voted in the 2020 election, which was the highest turnout in over a century, according to estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Pew Research Center.
Some 89% of registered Democrats and 93% of registered Republicans in the poll said they were completely certain they would vote. That points to potentially more enthusiasm over voting now compared to four years ago, when a Reuters/Ipsos poll in late October of 2020 showed 74% of Democrats and 79% of Republicans said they were certain to cast ballots.
Among the respondents in the latest poll who appeared most likely to vote, Harris also had a one-point lead over Trump, 47% to 46%.

Trump vs Harris: How the US electorate splits ahead of Election Day,"Oct 30 (Reuters) - The race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris has divided the U.S. electorate along lines of gender, race and education, with Trump improving his standing among men - particularly Hispanic men - while Harris' support has surged among women, helping her cut away at the Republicans' longstanding edge with white voters.
The following figures draw from an analysis of more than 14,000 responses by registered voters in Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted in October of this year and in the same month of 2020. The numbers have levels of precision between 2 and 6 percentage points.
Among women, Harris led Trump this month by 12 percentage points: 50% to 38%. By comparison, Biden led Trump by 5 points among women voters in October 2020. Some respondents in the polls said they were unsure how they would vote, or that they might pick a third-party candidate or not vote at all.
Democrats' gains among women have been fueled by Harris' standing among white women. Harris trailed Trump by 2 points among white women- 46% to 44% - a much smaller margin than the 16-point lead Trump had over Biden four years earlier.
Among men, Trump led Harris by 7 points: 48% to 41%. Ahead of the 2020 election, Trump was leading Biden by 1 point: 45% to 44%.
Trump's improved standing with male voters was driven in part by his gains among Hispanic men. Trump was trailing Harris by just 2 percentage points among Hispanic men - 46% to 44% - compared with his 16-point deficit with Biden - 53% to 37% - at the same point in 2020.
Hispanic voters, the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. electorate, have leaned heavily Democratic in most presidential elections since the 1970s but Trump has made significant inroads. Trump had the support of 38% of registered Hispanic voters, up from 32% at the same point in 2020. Harris' share of Hispanic voters was at 50%, compared with Biden's 54% in October 2020.
Among Black voters overall, 68% said they would vote for Harris, down from 74% who said in October 2020 they would vote for Biden. Trump only gained marginally - he was picked by 12% of Black voters this month compared to 11% four years ago. The share of Black voters who said they wouldn't vote was up slightly, 7% in October of this year compared to 3% just before the 2020 election.
The share of Black men saying they would vote for Harris - 63% - was down 8 points from Biden's 71% ahead of the 2020 election. The share of Black women picking Harris was down 4 points to 73% from the 77% who said they would vote for Biden in October 2020.
Some 19% of Black men and 7% of Black women said in October they would vote for Trump, up from 17% and 5% who said the same in October 2020.
Harris' 21-point lead among Hispanic women - 53% to 32% - was tighter than Biden's 31-point lead - 56% to 25% - among Hispanic women in October 2020.
Trump was the pick of 50% of white voters overall, down from 53% in October 2020. Some 40% of white voters picked Harris, up from 35% who said they would vote for Biden in October 2020. Harris' gains were mostly fueled by her advance among white women, though she advanced slightly among white men as well. Trump's 18-point lead over Harris among white men - 54% to 36% - was narrower than his 20-point lead four years ago.
Among voters without a college degree, Trump led Harris in October by 10 points - 49% to 39% - after leading Biden by 2 points four years earlier - 44% to 42%.
College graduates - who make up a smaller share of the electorate but tend to participate more in elections - were breaking more heavily Democratic, with Harris leading Trump by 21 points - 55% to 34% - compared with Biden's 9-point lead in October 2020.

Donald Trump elected US president in stunning comeback,"PALM BEACH, Florida, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Donald Trump was elected president, capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House and ushering in a new American leadership likely to test democratic institutions at home and relations abroad.
Trump, 78, recaptured the White House on Wednesday by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, Edison Research projected, following a campaign of dark rhetoric that deepened the polarization in the country.

The former president's victory in the swing state of Wisconsin pushed him over the threshold. As of 5:45 a.m. ET (1045 GMT) Trump had won 279 electoral votes to Harris' 223 with several states yet to be counted.
He also led Harris by about 5 million votes in the popular count.
""America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,"" Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida.

Trump’s political career had appeared to be over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat.
But he swept away challengers inside his Republican Party and then beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris by capitalizing on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed, without evidence, was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration.

Harris did not speak to supporters who had gathered at her alma mater Howard University. Her campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond, briefly addressed the crowd after midnight, saying Harris would speak publicly later on Wednesday.
""We still have votes to count,"" he said.
Republicans won a U.S. Senate majority, but neither party appeared to have an edge in the fight for control of the House of Representatives where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.

Major stock markets around the world rallied following Trump's victory, and the dollar was set for its biggest one-day jump since 2020.
JOBS AND ECONOMY
Voters identified jobs and the economy as the country's most pressing problem, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls. Many Americans remained frustrated by higher prices even amid record-high stock markets, fast-growing wages and low unemployment. With the administration of President Joe Biden taking much of the blame, a majority of voters said they trusted Trump more than Harris to address the issue.
Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel Trump's election victory. His loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force.
Trump prevailed despite persistently low approval ratings. Impeached twice, he has been criminally indicted four times and found civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump was convicted by a New York jury of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star.
His victory will have major implications for U.S. trade and climate change policies, the war in Ukraine, Americans' taxes and immigration.
His tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and U.S. allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon U.S. debt, economists say.
Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally.
He has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal. His opponents fear he will turn the Justice Department and other federal law enforcement agencies into political weapons to investigate perceived enemies.
A second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as race, gender, what and how children are taught, and reproductive rights.
HARRIS FALLS SHORT
Vice President Harris fell short in her 15-week sprint as a candidate, failing to galvanize enough support to defeat Trump, who occupied the White House from 2017-2021, or to allay voters' concerns about the economy and immigration.
Harris had warned that Trump wanted unchecked presidential power and posed a danger to democracy.
Nearly three-quarters of voters say American democracy is under threat, according to Edison Research exit polls, underscoring the polarization in a nation where divisions have only grown starker during a fiercely competitive race.
Trump ran a campaign characterized by apocalyptic language. He called the United States a ""garbage can"" for immigrants, pledged to save the economy from ""obliteration"" and cast some rivals as the ""enemy within.""
His diatribes were often aimed at migrants, who he said were ""poisoning the blood of the country,"" or Harris, whom he frequently derided as unintelligent.
Despite legal woes and controversies, Trump is only the second former president to win a second term after leaving the White House. The first was Grover Cleveland, who served two four-year terms starting in 1885 and 1893.
UNPRECEDENTED CAMPAIGN
Two months after Trump's conviction in the hush money case, a would-be assassin's bullet grazed his right ear during a July campaign rally in Pennsylvania, exacerbating fears about political violence. Another assassination attempt was thwarted in September at his Florida golf course. Trump blamed both attempts on what he claimed was the heated rhetoric of Democrats including Harris.
Barely eight days after the July shooting, Biden, 81, dropped out of the race, finally bowing to weeks of pressure from his fellow Democrats after a poor performance during his debate with Trump called into question his mental acuity and the viability of his reelection bid.
Biden's decision to step aside turned the contest into a sprint, as Harris raced to mount her own campaign in a matter of weeks, rather than the typical months. Her rise to the top of the ticket reenergized despondent Democrats, and she raised more than $1 billion in less than three months while erasing what had been a solid Trump lead in opinion polls.
Harris' financial advantage was partly countered by the intervention of the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who poured more than $100 million into a super PAC mobilizing Trump voters and used his social media site X to amplify pro-Trump messaging.
As the campaign drew to a close, Harris increasingly focused on warning Americans about the perils of reelecting Trump and offered an olive branch to disaffected Republicans.
She highlighted remarks from several former Trump officials, including his former chief of staff and retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, who described Trump as a ""fascist.""
Trump's victory will broaden the fissures in American society, given his false claims of election fraud, anti-immigrant rhetoric and demonization of his political opponents, said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who studies voter behavior and party politics.
A TRUMP SECOND TERM
Trump has vowed to reshape the executive branch, including firing civil servants he views as disloyal and using federal law enforcement agencies to investigate his political enemies, violating what has been a longstanding policy of keeping such agencies independent.
During his first term, Trump's most extreme demands were sometimes stymied by his own cabinet members, most notably when Vice President Mike Pence refused to block Congress from accepting the 2020 election results.
Once the 2024 vote is certified by Congress on Jan. 6, 2025, Trump and his incoming vice president, U.S. Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. Throughout his two-year-long campaign, Trump has signaled he will prioritize personal fealty in staffing his administration. He promised roles in his administration to Musk and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., both avid supporters.

Harris' lead in the six-day poll, which closed on Monday, differed little from her 45% to 42% advantage over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted a week earlier, reinforcing the view that the contest is extraordinarily tight with just two weeks left before the Nov. 5 election.

Both polls showed Harris with a lead within the margin of error, with the latest poll showing her ahead just 2 percentage points when using unrounded figures.
The new poll showed that voters have a dim view of the state of the economy and immigration - and they generally favor Trump's approach on these issues.
Some 70% of registered voters in the poll said their cost of living was on the wrong track, while 60% said the economy was heading in the wrong direction and 65% said the same of immigration policy.

Voters also said the economy and immigration, together with threats to democracy, were the country's most important problems. Asked which candidate had the better approach on the issues, Trump led on the economy - 46% to 38% - and on immigration by 48% to 35%.
Immigration also ranked as the No. 1 issue when respondents were asked what the next president should focus on most in their first 100 days in office. Some 35% picked immigration, with 11% citing income inequality and equal 10% shares citing healthcare and taxes.

But Trump fared poorly on the question of which candidate was better to address political extremism and threats to democracy, with Harris leading 42% to 35%. She also led on abortion policy and on healthcare policy.

Harris' lead over Trump might not be enough to win the election even if it holds through Nov 5.
National surveys, including Reuters/Ipsos polls, give important signals on the views of the electorate, but the state-by-state results of the Electoral College determine the winner, with seven battleground states likely to be decisive. Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, triumphing in the Electoral College even though she won the national popular vote by 2 points.

Polls have shown Harris and Trump are neck and neck in those battleground states.
The poll gave signs that voters - particularly Democrats - might be more enthused about this year's election than they were ahead of the November 2020 presidential election when Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump.
Some 79% of registered voters in the poll - including 87% of Democrats and 84% of Republicans - said they were ""completely certain"" they would cast a ballot in the presidential election. The share of sure-to-vote poll respondents was up from 74% in a Reuters/Ipsos survey conducted Oct. 23-27, 2020, when 74% of Democrats and 79% of Republicans said they were certain to cast ballots.
The new poll had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.
Harris entered the race in July after Biden ended his reelection effort following a poor debate performance against Trump in June. Trump at the time was widely seen as the frontrunner, partly based on his perceived strength on the economy after several years of high inflation under the Biden administration, which has eased in recent months.
Given the close match, the candidates' efforts to ensure that their supporters actually cast ballots will likely be key in determining the winner. Just two-thirds of U.S. adults voted in the November 2020 election, which was the highest turnout in over a century, according to estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Pew Research Center.
Roughly one-third of registered voters are Democrats and one-third Republican, with the balance independents or those who favor third parties, according to an estimate by Pew Research.
The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 4,129 U.S. adults online, nationwide, including 3,481 registered voters. Some 3,307 of the respondents were considered the most likely to turn out on Election Day. Among these likely voters, Harris held a 3-percentage-point lead over Trump, 48% to 45%.

"Trump's return to power fueled by Hispanic, working-class voter support","WASHINGTON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Donald Trump reshaped the U.S. electorate once again this year, piling up support among Hispanic voters, young people, and Americans without college degrees -- and winning more votes in nearly all of the country as he reclaimed the presidency.
Following the Republican's populist campaign, in which he promised to shield workers from global economic competition and offered a wide range of tax-cut proposals, Trump's increasing strength among working-class voters and nonwhite Americans helped grow his share of the vote almost everywhere.

The starkest increase may have been the 14-percentage-point swing in Trump's share of Hispanic voters, according to an exit poll conducted by Edison Research. Some 46% of self-identified Hispanic voters picked Trump, up from 32% in the 2020 election when Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.
Hispanics have largely favored Democrats for decades, but Trump's share this year was the highest for a Republican presidential candidate in exit polls going back to the 1970s, and just higher than the 44% share won by Republican George W. Bush in 2004, according to data compiled by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

This time, Trump won 55% of Hispanic men, 19 points more than the 36% share he won four years earlier, while he garnered support from 38% of Hispanic women, up 8 points from 2020.
Trump has made opposition to immigration a cornerstone of his political career, pledging to conduct mass deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally. Many Hispanic voters supported Trump's hardline positions, according to the Edison Research exit poll. About a quarter of Hispanic respondents said most immigrants in the country without documentation should be deported to the countries they came from, compared with 40% of voters overall in the poll.

ECONOMIC CONCERNS
Hispanic Americans skew more working-class than the country's white majority, with larger shares of Hispanics lacking college degrees, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.
Hispanics also tend to be younger than average in America, which means many have had less time to build wealth and have also been more exposed to the economic troubles of recent years, including high inflation and soaring interest rates for mortgages. Trump won 43% of voters age 18 to 29 - 7 points more than in 2020.
About two-thirds of voters considered the U.S. economy in poor shape, compared with about half of 2020 voters. Some 46% said their family's financial situation was worse than four years ago, compared with 20% who said the same in 2020.

""Republicans have consistently beat Democrats on connecting with voters on the economy,"" said Clarissa Martinez De Castro, vice president of the nonpartisan UnidosUS Latino Vote Initiative. ""This was a referendum on the economy, and that has consistently been the number one, two and three issues for Hispanic voters.""
In the battleground state of Arizona, a state Biden won in 2020, Mexican-born Arturo Laguna became an American citizen earlier this year and cast his first U.S. presidential ballot for Trump, citing the Republican's conservatism and his embrace of restrictions on abortion access.
""The three biggest things of importance are family values, being pro-life and religion,"" said Laguna, a 28-year-old corporate manager. ""I don't feel like Kamala represents those values.""
Across the country, in places where almost all votes were counted - roughly 2,200 counties nationwide - Trump's margin was 5 points higher than it was in 2020.

This broad increase - a rise of the Republican tide - in part owed to Trump's gains among voters without college degrees, a massive class of voters that spans racial and ethnic categories and made up just over half of the electorate on Tuesday.
Some 56% of voters without degrees picked Trump, up 6 points from the Republican's share in the 2020 exit poll. Harris won 55% of voters who have degrees, unchanged from Biden's share in 2020, when affluent suburbs helped power the Democrat's victory.
Trump's gains build on major shifts in the electorate since his triumph in the 2016 presidential election, when he outperformed past Republicans by far among working-class white voters. He largely maintained his dominance with the group this year, winning 66% of their vote, with his share down 1 point from 2020, according to the Edison Research exit poll.
Among people without college degrees and who are not white, however, Trump's share of the vote increased by 8 points.
While Trump gained ground in vote tallies across most of the country, some of his biggest advances were in and around big cities, areas that have been critical for past Democratic victories.
Trump flipped Nassau County - just east of New York City on Long Island - winning about 52 percent of the vote there.
And in the 25 big urban counties where nearly all the votes had been tallied by Wednesday morning, Harris won 60 percent of the vote, down about 5 percentage points from Biden’s performance in 2020 and the lowest share for a Democrat in those counties since at least 2012.
Harris won 53% of the women's vote, while Trump won 55% of the vote by men, with Trump performing slightly better with both groups compared with 2020.

Trump win to test limit of presidential power; Harris concedes but vows to 'fight',"PALM BEACH, Florida/WASHINGTON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Donald Trump recaptured the White House with a sweeping victory on Wednesday as tens of millions of Americans looked past his criminal charges and divisive rhetoric to embrace a leader who, if he carries out his campaign promises, will test the limits of presidential power.
Trump, 78, clinched Tuesday's election after a polarizing and dizzying campaign marked by two attempts on his life and Kamala Harris' late entry into the race following President Joe Biden's surprise withdrawal.

In a concession speech at her alma mater Howard University on Wednesday afternoon, Harris sought to console the voters who had hoped she would become the first woman to win the White House.
""To everyone who is watching, do not despair,"" she said. ""This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves.""
Harris said she had called Trump to congratulate him and promised to aid his transition. But she was not prepared to embrace his vision for the country.

Biden planned to address the nation at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on Thursday. The White House said Biden was committed to a smooth transition between now and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.
Trump's campaign said Biden called Trump to congratulate him and invite him to a meeting at the White House at an unspecified time.
Trump's resounding victory underscored how disenchanted Americans had become with the economy, border security and the direction of the country and its culture. Voters demanded a change, even if the agent of change was a convicted felon twice impeached and no longer the Washington outsider he was in his 2016 campaign.

Trump has said he wants the authority to fire civil servants he views as disloyal and has vowed to use federal law enforcement agencies to investigate or prosecute perceived enemies, including political rivals.
Trump promised roles in his administration to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a prominent Trump donor, and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Musk contributed at least $119 million to a pro-Trump spending group, giving him extraordinary influence to help his companies secure favorable government treatment.
The outcome defied polls that showed a razor-close race ahead of Tuesday's Election Day. Trump prevailed in at least five of the seven battleground states to push him over the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency and was leading in the remaining two, Arizona and Nevada, where votes were still being tallied.
Trump was also on track to become the first Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote since George W. Bush two decades ago.
His fellow Republicans wrested control of the U.S. Senate from Democrats and had added to their narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, though the outcome there may not be known for several days with dozens of races still uncalled.
""It was a hell of a good day,"" said Mitch McConnell, the longtime Senate Republican leader.

Unified Republican control on Capitol Hill would clear the way for major portions of Trump's legislative agenda, as it did in the first two years of his 2017-2021 presidency when Republicans whipped a major tax-cut bill through Congress that mainly benefited the wealthy.
""America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,"" Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd at the Palm Beach County Convention Center in Florida.
Major stock markets around the world rallied following Trump's victory, while the dollar and bitcoin surged.
OVERCOMING ODDS
Trump was elected despite persistently low approval ratings, four criminal indictments and a civil judgment against him for sexual abuse and defamation. In May, Trump became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime when a New York jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money paid to a porn star.
Trump's political career appeared over after his false claims of election fraud led a mob of supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 defeat. His efforts to reverse his defeat led to two separate indictments, though all the criminal cases against him are expected to end after his victory.
Trump swept away challengers inside his party and then beat Harris by capitalizing on voter concerns about high prices and what Trump claimed falsely was a rise in crime due to illegal immigration.
Trump's win will have major implications for U.S. trade and climate change policies, Americans' taxes and immigration, and U.S. foreign policy, including in the Middle East and Ukraine.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump, and they discussed ""the Iranian threat"" and the need to work together for Israel's security, Netanyahu's office said.
Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, called for an end to the ""blind support"" for Israel from the United States.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed Trump's commitment to ""peace through strength,"" while the Kremlin said it would wait and see if his victory could help end the war in Ukraine more quickly. Trump had said he could end the war in 24 hours but has not offered a detailed plan.
Trump's tariff proposals could spark a fiercer trade war with China and U.S. allies, while his pledges to reduce corporate taxes and implement a spate of new cuts could balloon U.S. debt, economists say.
Chinese President Xi Jinping sent Trump a congratulatory message and said he hopes the two powers will coexist peacefully and achieve win-win cooperation, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol spoke with Trump and congratulated him, as officials at the trade ministry in Seoul swiftly convened meetings to weigh the potential impact of Trump's proposed tariffs.
A second Trump presidency could drive a bigger wedge between Democrats and Republicans on issues such as immigration, race, gender and reproductive rights.
Trump has promised to launch a mass deportation campaign targeting immigrants in the country illegally.
Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel the victory.
Trump's support among women, whose backing Democrats had counted on, improved from four years ago. And his loyal base of rural, white and non-college educated voters again showed up in force, according to Edison Research exit polls.

Among those seven battlegrounds, Pennsylvania, the most populous, stands out as the most likely state to determine whether Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump is the next president.
The candidates' strategies reflect this reality, with the vast majority of their ad spending and campaign events directed at those seven states that swing between political parties.
Here is a closer look at why the U.S. presidential race will be decided by a small subset of Americans:
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
WHY ISN'T THE ELECTION DECIDED BY THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE?
Unlike elections for other federal candidates and statewide offices, the presidential contest is not solely based on the popular vote. Instead, under a system known as the Electoral College, the winning candidate in each state, as well as Washington, D.C., receives that state's electoral votes, which are largely based on population.
A candidate needs to win a majority of the country's 538 electoral votes, or 270, which is possible even when losing the overall national vote, as Trump did when he won the White House in 2016.

In the event of a 269-269 tie, the U.S. House of Representatives chooses the winner, with each state's delegation getting a single vote -- a scenario that analysts say would likely favor former President Trump.
If every state aside from the battlegrounds votes as expected, that would give Vice President Harris 226 electoral votes and Trump 219, with the remaining 93 up for grabs.
WHICH STATES ARE CONSIDERED IN PLAY?
There are seven states that could swing either way on Nov. 5: the Rust Belt trio of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Sun Belt quartet of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.

Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had served as a ""blue wall"" for Democratic candidates for a generation. But, in 2016, Trump narrowly carried all three, fueling his upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Four years later, Joe Biden won the presidency after reclaiming Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania for Democrats, while also notching surprising victories in Georgia and Arizona, two states that had historically voted Republican.

HOW CLOSE IS THIS ELECTION?
As close as it gets.
As of Oct. 16, according to a New York Times public poll tracker, all seven battleground states were in a virtual dead heat. Trump held a narrow 2-percentage-point lead in Arizona; the other six swing states were all within a point on average, the tracker showed.
The race appears even closer than the 2020 contest. That year, a shift of only 43,000 votes in three states - less than one-third of a percentage point of all voters nationwide - from Biden to Trump would have been enough for Trump to win reelection.
WHY IS PENNSYLVANIA SO IMPORTANT?
The simplest answer is that the state has 19 electoral votes, more than any other battleground.
Pennsylvania is widely seen as critical to either Harris' or Trump's chances of winning the White House and is considered the most likely ""tipping point"" state – the one that carries a candidate past 269 electoral votes.
If Harris loses Pennsylvania, she would need to carry either North Carolina or Georgia – two states that have voted Democratic a total of three times in the last four decades – to have any chance of prevailing.
Conversely, if Trump loses Pennsylvania, he would need to win either Wisconsin or Michigan, which have only voted for a Republican once since the 1980s - for Trump eight years ago.
Both campaigns have treated Pennsylvania as the most important state, with Harris and Trump spending more time there than in any other. The campaigns and their allies had spent $279.3 million in broadcast advertising in Pennsylvania through Oct. 7, more than $75 million ahead of second-place Michigan, according to the tracking firm AdImpact.
WHY IS A SINGLE DISTRICT IN NEBRASKA DRAWING SO MUCH ATTENTION?
Forty-eight states award their electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, but two states, Nebraska and Maine, allocate one electoral vote to the winner in each congressional district. In 2020, Biden won one of Nebraska's five votes, while Trump took one of Maine's four votes.
The single electoral vote in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, centered on Omaha, is seen as competitive, though independent analysts favor Harris to win it. Both parties have spent millions of dollars airing ads in the Omaha market.
That lone vote could be crucial. If Harris wins Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin while Trump takes the other four battlegrounds – an entirely plausible outcome – Nebraska's 2nd District would determine whether the election ends in a tie or whether Harris prevails.

While the gap between the two remained steady compared with a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted a week earlier, the new poll, which closed on Sunday, gave signs that voters - particularly Democrats - might be more enthused about this year's election than they were ahead of the November 2020 presidential election when Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump.

Harris entered the race in July after Biden ended his reelection effort following a poor debate performance against Trump in June. Trump at the time was widely seen as the front-runner, partly based on his perceived strength on the economy after several years of high inflation under the Biden administration, which has eased in recent months.
More recently, Harris appears to be drawing strength from voters picking her as the better candidate for healthcare policy and for handling political extremism, although voters also rate the U.S. economy as the top issue in the election and said Trump was the better economic steward, according to the new poll.

Trump led Harris 45% to 40% when voters were asked who was the better candidate for the ""economy, unemployment and jobs,"" the category of national priorities that 26% of poll respondents picked as the biggest problem facing the nation, compared with 23% who picked political extremism and 3% who said healthcare.

While national surveys, including Reuters/Ipsos polls, give important signals on the views of the electorate, the state-by-state results of the Electoral College determine the winner, with seven battleground states likely to be decisive.

Given the close match, the candidates' efforts to ensure that their supporters actually cast ballots will likely be key in determining the winner. Just two-thirds of U.S. adults voted in the November 2020 election, which was the highest turnout in over a century, according to estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Pew Research Center.
Roughly one-third of registered voters are Democrats and one-third Republican, with the balance independents or something else, according to Pew.
While voters appear relatively eager to cast ballots, neither candidate was liked by a majority of the electorate. Only 46% of voters in the poll said they had a favorable opinion of Harris, and 42% said the same of Trump.
The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 938 U.S. adults online, nationwide, including 807 registered voters. Among these, 769 were considered the most likely to turn out on Election Day. Among these likely voters, Harris held a 3-percentage-point lead over Trump, 47% to 44%.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump says that if he does not win the Nov. 5 election, he will cry fraud and not accept the results - just as he did four years ago when he lost to Democratic President Joe Biden.

“If I lose - I’ll tell you what, it’s possible. Because they cheat. That’s the only way we’re gonna lose, because they cheat,"" Trump said at a Michigan rally in September.




A refusal by Trump to accept a victory by Democratic rival Kamala Harris could throw the United States into political instability at a time when the country is already deeply divided.
After Trump lost the 2020 election, he and his allies attempted to overturn the result through dozens of lawsuits that ultimately failed to alter or delay the vote count.
He also pressured officials in Georgia to find more votes for him; and his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 in a failed effort to stop his vice president, Mike Pence, from certifying Biden's victory.

One key difference this time is that Trump does not have the presidential levers of power that he did in 2020. And new state and federal laws have been put in place to make it more difficult to influence election results.
Still, Trump and his allies have been laying the groundwork for months to cry foul if he loses on Nov. 5. He could contest a win by Harris in the courts or raise doubts about the validity of her victory among supporters that could have unforeseen consequences.

SMOKE AND MIRRORS
Republicans and Democrats expect that vote counting could drag on for several days after Nov. 5 as mail-in ballots are tabulated and other votes are tallied and verified.
If it appears Trump is losing, the delay will give him an opportunity to claim fraud and attempt to undermine confidence in election officials, while also possibly encouraging his supporters to protest. He has already threatened to jail election workers and other public officials for “unscrupulous behavior,” although he would need to win the election first.

Trump can take his case directly to the American public without waiting for proof, using social media, press conferences and interviews.
""President Trump has been very clear that we must have a free and fair election,"" said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign.
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
IN THE BATTLEGROUNDS
Republicans have already preemptively filed more than 100 lawsuits in the battleground states that will decide the election to seed the ground for post-election challenges, including claiming, without evidence, that non-citizens will be voting in large numbers.

Both parties plan to dispatch thousands of trained volunteers called poll watchers to monitor voting and vote counting with a mandate to report any irregularities.
Some voting rights activists are concerned that Republican poll watchers could be disruptive, but the Republican Party says the volunteers have been trained to stay within the law.
As they did in 2020, Trump's allies in key states - local election officials, state lawmakers and perhaps judges - could seek to delay certification, the confirmation of a state's official tally, through claims of fraud.
Those efforts did not succeed last time, and election law experts say the laws in those states are clear that local officials lack the power to throw out ballots or derail the process.
Five of the seven battleground states have Democratic governors but Democratic activists worry about Georgia, whose state election board recently gave unprecedented authority to local officials to conduct inquiries, a move they say could give an opening to bad-faith actors who attempt to contest or delay the vote count.
A Georgia judge, however, ruled this week that local officials must certify the results and do not have the discretion to do otherwise.
All states must submit their certified totals before the Electoral College meets in December and electors cast their votes. That vote is then delivered to Congress for final certification in January.
Trump-inspired court challenges and certification delays could cause a state to miss the filing deadline. That could provide grist for Republican objections in Congress.
Some election law experts caution that it is difficult to predict how novel legal disputes over certification might be resolved, especially if they are handled by judges sympathetic to Trump's claims.
CONGRESS HAS FINAL SAY
After the 2020 election, Congress passed a reform law that makes it more difficult for candidate to mount the kind of challenge Trump attempted.
It makes clear that the vice president, who in this case would be Harris, has no authority to delay national certification or throw out a state's results, as Trump urged Pence to do in 2020.
The measure also requires that an objection to a state's electoral count cannot be brought unless one-fifth of the members of each house of Congress agrees. After that, it takes a majority vote in each house for an objection to be found valid.
In the unlikely result that enough electoral votes are tossed so that neither candidate reaches the necessary majority, the newly elected U.S. House of Representatives would choose the next president.
CIVIL UNREST
Any effort by Trump to suggest the election was rigged could potentially lead to civil unrest, as it did on Jan. 6, 2021.
Experts who monitor militant right-wing groups, such as Peter Montgomery of the People For the American Way, a liberal think tank, say they are less concerned about a violent response from these groups than they are about threats against election workers counting votes. There also could be violent demonstrations in the capitals of battleground states, Montgomery said.
Hundreds of people who were involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol have been convicted and jailed for their actions, a powerful deterrent to others who may be considering taking similar actions.

Where Harris and Trump stand on key issues,,31-Oct-24,Reuters,Where Harris and Trump Stand on Key Issues
"Harris, Trump accuse each other of fomenting division in campaign's final stretch","GREEN BAY, Wisconsin, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris accused each other of deepening the discord of a deeply polarized nation as the U.S. presidential campaign entered its final week on Wednesday.
The Republican former president donned an orange reflective safety vest and climbed into the passenger seat of a garbage truck in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to call attention to a Tuesday comment by Democratic President Joe Biden that he said revealed the disdain Democratic leaders feel towards Trump's supporters.

Taking questions as he sat in the truck, Trump said Biden ""should be ashamed of himself"" and that Harris was guilty by association. Trump supporters ""are not garbage,"" the former president said.
Trump, however, distanced himself from the comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday, Tony Hinchcliffe, who triggered this week's political firestorm by saying Puerto Rico is ""a floating island of garbage.""

""I don't know who he is...I know nothing about him,"" said Trump, adding, ""I love Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico loves me.""
Vice President Harris, meanwhile, urged voters in North Carolina to ""turn the page"" on Trump, who she said was focused on his own grievances, rather than Americans' needs.
""If he is elected, on Day One Donald Trump will walk into that office with an enemies list. When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list,"" she said.

The race has tightened in its final weeks, and a Tuesday Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Harris leading Trump by just 44% to 43% among registered voters nationally, well within the poll's margin of error. Other opinion polls show tight margins in the seven battleground states that will decide the Nov. 5 election.
Tensions are running high. Election workers in competitive states are bracing for violence, and authorities in Florida arrested a man for menacing voters with a machete.

Polarization in America has fostered distrust. According to a March Reuters/Ipsos poll, some 38% of Republicans said they viewed the Democratic Party as an ""imminent threat"" to the U.S., while 41% of Democrats said that of Republicans.
Trump continues to falsely claim that his 2020 loss to Biden was the result of widespread fraud and has signaled that he will challenge a 2024 defeat if he deems it unfair, having filed along with supporters a wave of lawsuits this year objecting to various election rules around the country.
Much of the legal effort has focused on the risk of voting by noncitizens, though private and state reviews have repeatedly shown that the illegal practice is very rare. The campaign to focus on the issue won a victory on Wednesday when the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated Virginia's decision to purge from its voter rolls 1,600 people who state officials concluded may not be citizens, a claim that Biden's administration disputed.

BIDEN'S 'GARBAGE' GAFFE
Biden's Tuesday comment, in which he appeared to describe one or some Trump supporters as ""garbage,"" undercut Harris' pitch to work with those who disagree with her and move past the bitter divisions that define U.S. politics.
Biden, an 81-year-old incumbent who ended his reelection bid in July after a disastrous debate performance against Trump, has a history of misspeaking. He said he was referring to racist comments made by a single speaker at a Sunday Trump rally, while Trump accused Biden of referring to all those who support him.
""We're 'garbage.' And I call you the heart and soul of America,"" Trump said.
Since his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump has built broad appeal with working-class white Americans, while Democrats have consolidated their support among more affluent, college-educated voters. Control of the White House and Congress has flipped back and forth in recent elections, allowing neither party to claim control over both branches of government for long.
A SOUTHERN BATTLEGROUND
The dueling rallies in North Carolina highlighted the crucial role the southern state might play in the election. It was the only battleground state to back Trump in 2020. It last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 2008 though it has had a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, since 2017.
Trump leads Harris by just one percentage point in the state, according to a polling average by FiveThirtyEight.
Last month's hurricane damage has made North Carolina's results especially difficult to predict.
The hard-hit western region leans Republican and accounted for about 9% of the vote in 2020, according to an analysis by Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini.
While some state officials - including some Republicans - have praised federal cleanup efforts, Trump has falsely claimed that disaster aid intended for the state was diverted to help immigrants.
Some 43% of North Carolina's registered voters have already cast ballots, and they are more likely to be white, suburban and female than the overall electorate, according to Catawba College political science professor Michael Blitzer.
The outcome may not be known for some time, as absentee ballots can be counted for up to 10 days after the election.

Nothing untoward had occurred. Democrats tend to live in more populous urban areas, where counting votes takes longer. Democrats also have embraced mail voting more readily than Republicans after Trump's false claims that mail ballots are untrustworthy, and those ballots take longer to count than Election Day votes. Trump has both encouraged and criticized early and mail-in voting in 2024.
Democrats are outpacing Republicans in mail ballots once again this year, according to an early vote tracker maintained by the University of Florida's Election Lab, though Republicans have narrowed the gap.

There are seven battleground states likely to decide the election, each with its own rules for handling and counting ballots. Here's what to expect on Election Day and beyond:
ARIZONA
Voting by mail is extremely popular in Arizona; nearly 90% of voters cast their ballots early, most by mail, in 2020. Election officials in Arizona can begin processing and tabulating mail ballots upon receipt, but results cannot be released until one hour after polls close.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
Any mail ballots dropped off on Election Day itself cannot be processed until the polls have closed. That is often a sizable number – in 2022, those ""late early"" votes comprised one-fifth of all ballots in Maricopa County, the state's largest – and can take days to count.
The initial results on election night should be mostly early votes, which could favor Harris, before the numbers shift toward Trump as Election Day votes are tallied.

GEORGIA
Early in-person voting is popular in Georgia, where officials expect 65% to 70% of ballots to be cast at early poll locations. Absentee or mail ballots, which may comprise around 5% of the vote, can be processed - which includes steps such as verifying signatures - starting two weeks before the election, though workers must wait until Election Day to begin counting them.
All early votes – in-person and mail – must be counted and reported by 8 p.m. ET (0000 GMT) on election night, according to state law, which could create a ""blue mirage"" in Harris' favor at first. Officials are aiming to have all votes, including those from Election Day, tallied by midnight.
Ballots from overseas and military voters will be accepted up to three days after the election if postmarked by Nov. 5. There were more than 21,000 such ballots requested, so an extremely close election might not be resolved until those votes are tabulated.
MICHIGAN
Since the 2020 election, Michigan has instituted early in-person voting for the first time and begun permitting jurisdictions with more than 5,000 people to begin processing and tabulating mail ballots eight days before Election Day. Smaller jurisdictions can do so the day before Nov. 5.
Officials hope those changes will allow the state to report results more quickly than in 2020, when mail ballots could not be processed in advance. That created a ""red mirage"" on election night, when the state's early counts of Election Day votes favored Trump. Biden eventually surpassed Trump on the strength of mail ballots, which took longer to tally. Trump falsely claimed he was the victim of fraud.

NEVADA
Nevada's slow vote counting in 2020 – news outlets did not call the state for Biden until five days after Election Day – launched countless memes, but officials say changes since then should speed up the process.
Most notably, counties were permitted to begin processing and counting mail ballots on Oct. 21. In addition, workers can start tabulating early in-person votes at 8 a.m. PT (1500 GMT) on Election Day, rather than waiting until polls close.
But Nevada still might not get called right away. Mail voting has grown popular in the state, and it is the only battleground that accepts late-arriving mail ballots. That could also create a ""blue shift"" as more votes are counted.
Any ballot postmarked by Nov. 5 will still be counted if it arrives within four days. Those late ballots historically favor Democrats, so a shift toward Harris could occur as votes are counted after Election Day.
NORTH CAROLINA
Election officials start processing and scanning mail ballots ahead of Election Day. After polls close, the first reported results will likely be mostly mail ballots as well as early in-person votes. Election Day votes will be counted and reported throughout the evening, with full results expected by midnight.
Harris may appear to lead early thanks to mail ballots, while Trump could close the gap as Election Day votes are counted.
If the election is as close as polls suggest, the outcome in North Carolina may remain unclear for a week or more. Absentee ballots that arrive on Nov. 5, as well as ballots from overseas and military voters, are tallied during the 10-day canvass period that follows Election Day. In 2020, media outlets did not call North Carolina for Trump until Nov. 13, 10 days after the election.
PENNSYLVANIA
Perhaps the most important battleground, Pennsylvania did not have a clear winner in 2020 for four days after Election Day, as officials sifted through a huge backlog of mail ballots. The state is among only a handful that do not permit election workers to process or tabulate mail ballots until 7 a.m. ET on Election Day, which means it will likely again take days before the outcome is known.
With more Democrats than Republicans voting by mail, the early results – based on in-person Election Day votes – will probably show Trump ahead, but his lead will likely shrink as more mail ballots are counted.
That pattern in 2020 prompted Trump to falsely claim fraud. This year, a new law requires most counties to announce at midnight on election night how many mail ballots remain to be counted in an effort to forestall conspiracy theories.
WISCONSIN
Like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin is among the few states that do not allow election officials to process or count mail ballots until the morning of the election, which means there can be a delay in reporting the results of those early votes.
In addition, many of the state's largest cities transport mail ballots to a centralized location for processing and tabulating. That can lead to significant batches of votes getting reported all at once in the early morning after polls close.
In 2020, Trump and his allies falsely claimed fraud after Milwaukee, the state's largest city, reported nearly 170,000 absentee ballots around 3:30 a.m. CT (0830 GMT), giving Biden a huge spike that moved him into the lead for the first time. But that increase was expected due to the way the city processes those ballots and the fact that Democrats were more likely to vote by mail. A similar pattern is probable in 2024.

Democrats have a plan if Trump prematurely declares election victory,"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Democrats are readying a rapid-fire response to flood social media and the airwaves with calls for calm and patience with vote-counting should Donald Trump try to prematurely claim election victory, as he did in 2020, Harris campaign and party officials told Reuters.
The Republican candidate told reporters this week that he hoped to be able to declare victory on Election Day, although election experts have cautioned that it could take several days for the final result to be known, especially if there are demands for vote recounts in some key areas. Trump is locked in a razor-thin race with Democratic rival Kamala Harris.

U.S. election winners are typically declared by major media outlets who analyze vote counts provided by election officials. While candidates sometimes declare victory before those calls are made, it is unusual to do so before the winner is at least arguably apparent.
""We are sadly ready if he does and, if we know that he is actually manipulating the press and attempting to manipulate the consensus of the American people ... we are prepared to respond,"" Harris said in an interview with ABC on Wednesday.

She gave no details of those preparations, but six Democratic Party and Harris campaign officials said the initial fight against any early Trump victory claim would take place in the court of public opinion. They plan to flood social media and television airwaves with demands that all votes be counted before victories are declared.
""As soon as he (Trump) falsely declares victory, we're ready to get up on TV and provide the truth and tap a broad network of people who can use their influence to push back,"" a top official with the Democratic National Committee said in an interview.

A senior Harris campaign official said in a conference call with reporters on Friday they ""fully expect"" that Trump will falsely claim victory on Tuesday night, before all the votes are fully counted.
""He did this before it failed. If he does it again, it will fail,"" the official said.
In 2020, Trump declared himself the winner in the early morning hours after Election Day, three days before the first television networks made a call. He ultimately lost to his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. He has never accepted the result and continues to falsely assert that it was stolen from him through widespread fraud.

Steve Bannon, a key Trump ally, said Trump should quickly declare victory.
""He should stand up and say, 'Hey, I've won this,'"" Bannon told a New York Times reporter on Tuesday, shortly after being released from a federal prison, where he served four months for defying congressional subpoenas on the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol.
The Trump campaign told Reuters that the Republican candidate would fight for all votes until the polls close, but it did not directly answer a question about whether Trump planned to again declare victory before the race was called.

One Trump donor, Bill Bean, who has at times been critical of the former president, told Reuters he hopes either Harris or Trump win by wide margins, so that the results are as widely accepted as possible.
NO REPUBLICAN FIREWALL
In 2020, Trump's victory declaration was met with condemnation from Democrats and many high-profile Republicans. Markets reacted with a shrug, with major stock indices climbing modestly in the days after the election.
But this time could be different.
The former president has consolidated near-total control of the Republican Party in the intervening years, meaning many influential conservatives could be more willing to go along with his claims, several political strategists said.
""We've seen plenty of evidence that he is in complete control of the party ... and we've seen no evidence that party officials or elected officials will push back,"" said Chip Felkel, a long-time Republican strategist who is critical of Trump.
Trump and his Republican allies have also spent months laying the groundwork for contesting a loss by claiming that non-citizens could try to vote for the Democratic Party and by readying an army of lawyers to go to court to challenge results.
At his rallies, Trump often says they need to make sure their win is ""too big to rig.""

Pro-Trump poll watchers primed for Election Day action in key state,"MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The moment election workers in the Milwaukee area started counting mail-in votes, activists backing Donald Trump's claim that his 2020 defeat was fraudulent began challenging every ballot.
The observers raised a litany of complaints as poll staff read the absentee names and addresses aloud, as required in the state of Wisconsin, according to local election officials who said the activists were seeking to intimidate the volunteers.

The issues included objections that the workers were speaking too softly, that envelopes did not contain a signed form from the voter attesting they requested the ballot and even the presence of an ink scratch, said the officials, adding that the disruption caused long delays.
The scene at a school in the city of Glendale on July 2, during a Democratic primary election for a state senate seat, was similarly played out at two other polling locations in the city, and at Milwaukee's central ballot-counting station, with a total of at least nine observers acting in coordination, according to election officials in the battleground state.

""Mail-in ballots are not secure,"" said Harry Wait, one of three watchers at Glendale city hall, adding that he and his fellow observers had not tried to intimidate anyone and sat quietly during the vote count.
""The whole system is fraudulent.""
Many local officials fear the activist action at election sites, while limited, was merely a rehearsal for a much larger-scale event on Nov. 5, when Republican Trump goes up against Democrat Kamala Harris in the fight for the White House.

""It was absolutely a dry run for the general election,"" Glendale's Democratic Mayor Bryan Kennedy told Reuters, adding that police were called to two polling stations by election workers and ordered two observers to leave, when it was decided the ballot challenges were without basis.
""They were challenging every absentee ballot with whatever reason they could pull out of thin air,"" Kennedy said.
With days to go until the presidential vote, opinion polling shows the election is on a knife-edge, with few places as pivotal as Wisconsin.

Kennedy and four other election officials interviewed by Reuters - three Democrats and a Republican - warned that a repeat of the ballot-challenging on a wider scale could cause disruptions and delays to mail-in results in this pivotal state which Democratic President Joe Biden won by a whisker in 2020.
Warren Dugan, chief elections inspector at the school in Glendale in July, said he had to suspend vote-counting for 90 minutes while local authorities advised on how to respond to the watcher challenges to every ballot.
""If something like this happens next week in the general election it would be very difficult to get through everything.""
Wait is the former head of H.O.T. (Honest, Open, Transparent) Government, a grassroots group that supports Trump's unsubstantiated claims that mail-in ballots are rife with fraud, which U.S. election security officials have said is not true.
Wait and Jefferson Davis, who heads another grassroots organization that questions the 2020 result, the Ad Hoc Committee For Wisconsin's Full Forensic Physical Cyber Audit, told Reuters they are working with like-minded groups to deploy up to 1,500 observers collectively at voting sites and count centers across the state on Nov. 5, and to monitor and film ballot drop boxes before then.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm those numbers. Wait and 66-year-old Davis work independently from each other.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) and Republican Party of Wisconsin said they have trained more than 5,000 election observers in the state, adding that their objective was to ensure the integrity and efficiency of the voting process.
Activists will particularly focus on mail-in ballots, watching for non-U.S. citizens registering to vote, college students who have not been in Wisconsin long enough to be eligible, and people who do not have a photo ID, according to Davis. He said that he works within the law and observers linked to his group will not cause trouble.
Meanwhile, Democratic officials told Reuters they are mobilizing tens of thousands of volunteers in ""voter protection"" roles across key states to combat ""MAGA Republicans' attacks on our democracy.""
""We're ready to stand up for all eligible voters' access to the ballot box,"" said Alex Floyd, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee.
Election officials in Wisconsin are taking activists' plans seriously. They told Reuters they will have extra security at polling locations compared to the 2020 election. That includes having undercover police present inside some voting sites, extra law enforcement on the ground and street closures.

'NATURE OF ELECTIONS IS ADVERSARIAL'
Poll watchers, who monitor the casting and counting of ballots at polling stations, have been a feature of American elections for decades.
Andrew Garber, counsel for the voting rights and elections team at the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, said the big difference this time round is that many of the pro-Republican poll observers belong to groups who suspect there was widespread foul play in the 2020 election so can arrive primed to spot trouble.
""These poll watchers can scare people, create bad voting experiences that discourage people from voting in the future, and it could be the genesis of misinformation that ends up undermining people's confidence in our election,"" Garber said.
Jay Stone, the head of H.O.T, told Reuters his group is being unfairly maligned by Wisconsin election officials, who he said made false claims of disorderly conduct at polling sites because they don't want election observers to exercise their lawful rights to challenge absentee ballots.
""The very nature of elections is adversarial,"" he added in an interview at his home in Pleasant Prairie, about 40 miles from Milwaukee. ""Why should the casting and the counting of the ballots be anything but adversarial?""
The pro-Republican observer groups are focusing on voting locations in five ""hotspots"", including the cities of Milwaukee and Madison, according to Wait and Davis. Those places were the focus of Trump's claims about fraud in Wisconsin in 2020.
Wait, Stone and others argue that mail-in ballots should be returned with a signed form from the voter attesting that they applied for their ballot, otherwise a single voter could apply for multiple ballots or ask for somebody else's.
The Wisconsin Elections Commission rejected such scenarios, saying it has designed mail-in envelopes that require voters to sign with a witness that they applied for the ballot.
Wisconsin Republican Party spokesperson Matt Fisher said Davis assisted in ""recruiting and sending volunteers,"" adding that the party has not communicated with Wait.
Russ Otten, chair of the Sheboygan County Republican Party in Wisconsin, called Wait a ""phenomenal person"", adding: ""Harry's been a crusader for truth for many years.""
GUILLOTINE POST FIRES ENMITY
Under Wisconsin law, unlike in most of the seven battleground states, poll observers do not need to be affiliated to a party, or be trained or certified in any way.
George Christenson, a Democrat and the Milwaukee County clerk, the top election official there, said police will be able to respond to problems at polling sites in all the county's 10 cities and nine villages.
""If it gets egregious, obstructive, disrespectful or even violent, law enforcement will be available and at the ready,"" he said. The county district attorney also has an ""election integrity team"" on standby to respond to bogus challenges of ballots, he added.
Ann Jacobs, a Democrat and chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said polling site staff have been told to be extra vigilant for signs of trouble.
""These observers can basically be an arm's length away from poll workers. There's a guy literally staring at you taking your name down. That's intimidating,"" she said. ""Their goal is to convince people that the election is being stolen.""
""Continual threats against election officials are a stain on our democracy,"" Jacobs added. ""This very specifically includes Mr. Wait.""
Earlier this month Wait posted a French Revolution-era picture on social media of someone being guillotined, and suggested the same fate should befall Jacobs. He defended the post as a legitimate expression of free speech.
Jacobs declined to say what action, if any, had been taken against Wait though she called him ""very dangerous.""
""When people put up photos suggesting I should be killed, the appropriate authorities are contacted and the threat is addressed,"" she said.

"Trump, Biden discuss Ukraine and Middle East in 'cordial' White House meeting","WASHINGTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, longtime political rivals, discussed Ukraine and the Middle East on Wednesday in a cordial meeting designed to demonstrate a smooth transfer of power despite deep disagreements over policy.
The two American leaders sat side by side before a roaring fire in the White House Oval Office, a peaceful scene that belied tensions between them.

The meeting lasted roughly two hours, she said.
Biden argued support for Ukraine was good for U.S. national security because a strong and stable Europe would keep America from being dragged into war, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told journalists.
Trump has pledged to end the Russia-Ukraine war quickly without saying how.
Trump told the New York Post he and Biden ""talked very much about the Middle East"" during their conversation. ""I wanted to know his views on where we are,"" the Post quoted Trump as saying. ""And he gave them to me, he was very gracious.""

A Democrat, Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election but dropped out of the 2024 race in July after a disastrous debate with Trump, a Republican. Vice President Kamala Harris became the candidate but lost to Trump.
A SMOOTH TRANSITION
Both men talked about a smooth transition of power.
""Looking forward to having a, like we said, smooth transition - do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, what you need,"" Biden told the president-elect. ""Welcome, welcome back.""

Trump, due to take over on Jan. 20, said: ""Politics is tough, and it's many cases not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today, and I appreciate it very much - a transition that's so smooth it'll be as smooth as it can get. And I very much appreciate that, Joe.""
Reporters shouted questions but were ushered out.
The traditional courtesy of welcoming the president-elect into the Oval Office is one that Trump did not extend when Biden won in 2020.

The two men have hurled criticism at each other for years. Their respective teams hold vastly different positions on policies from climate change to Russia to trade.
Biden, 81, has portrayed Trump as a threat to democracy, while Trump, 78, has portrayed Biden as incompetent. Trump made false claims of widespread fraud after losing the 2020 election.
During the sit-down, Biden pushed his priorities for Congress' lame-duck session, including funding the government and providing additional funds for disaster relief, Jean-Pierre said. Biden's chief of staff Jeff Zients and Trump's, Susie Wiles, also were present.
First lady Jill Biden joined Biden in greeting Trump on his arrival. The White House said she gave Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for his wife, Melania Trump, and expressed her team’s readiness to assist with the transition.
Melania Trump's office said on X that she would not attend the White House meeting. ""Her husband's return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success,"" it said.
Trump celebrated his victory earlier in the day with Republicans from the House of Representatives. Edison Research projected on Wednesday that Republicans would have a majority in the House, meaning Trump's party will control both chambers of Congress.
""Isn't it nice to win? It's nice to win. It's always nice to win,"" Trump said. ""The House did very well.""
Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk joined Trump at the meeting with Republican lawmakers.
TRANSITION PARTIALLY STALLED
Despite the show of goodwill, the transition itself has partially stalled.
Trump’s team, which has announced some members of the incoming president's cabinet, has yet to sign agreements that would lead to office space and government equipment as well as access to government officials, facilities and information, the White House said.
“The Trump-Vance transition lawyers continue to constructively engage with the Biden-Harris Administration lawyers regarding all agreements contemplated by the Presidential Transition Act,"" said Brian Vance, a Trump transition spokesperson, referring to the law that governs the transfer of power.
Valerie Smith Boyd, director of the Partnership for Public Service’s Center for Presidential Transition, a non-profit that advises incoming administrations, said the agreement underscores that the U.S. only has one president at a time and includes pledges to sign ethics pacts not to profit off information provided in the transition.
“That needs to be signed for interaction to begin with federal agencies,” she said. “Everything is hinging on that.”
The meeting was the two men's first substantive one since their June debate. Biden, Trump and Harris also appeared together in New York on Sept. 11 at the site of the 2001 plane attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.

"Trump gains with Hispanic men, Harris up with white women, Reuters/Ipsos polls show","WASHINGTON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump has nearly erased Democrats' longstanding advantage among Hispanic men ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election when he will face Democrat Kamala Harris, according to an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polling.
Former President Trump now trails Vice President Harris by just 2 percentage points among Hispanic men - 44% to 46% - compared with his 19 point deficit with Democrat Joe Biden at the same point in 2020, according to the analysis of more than 15,000 responses to Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted in the month through Oct. 21 and during the same period of 2020.

Trump's gains have been offset by increased support for Harris among white women, who favored him over Biden by 12 points late in 2020 but now lean Republican by 3 points, 46% to 43%. The two candidates are locked in an exceptionally tight race, with Harris up only marginally - 46% to 43% - in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Oct. 16-21.
The shifts are part of larger changes in the coalitions that each candidate is counting on for victory, with Trump boosting his advantage with Hispanic and Black voters - particularly men - while Harris has cut away at the Republicans' longstanding edge with white voters by gaining ground with women.

Robert Alomia, a Hispanic voter in Elizabeth, New Jersey, who works at a security firm, said he respects Trump's career as a businessman and plans to vote for him this year after sitting out the 2020 election.
""We need people who think quick and people who are willing to lead - he’s a leader,"" said Alomia, 42, who said he was also sympathetic to Trump's hardline views on immigration. ""You have these people that come into the country where they get everything, and basically the door is open for them.""

Trump has accused the Biden administration of leaving the southern border open to migrants while Harris has pushed back against that by blaming Trump for pressuring Republicans in Congress to jettison a bipartisan border security bill that have would tightened border controls.
Hispanic voters, the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. electorate, have leaned heavily Democratic in most presidential elections since the 1970s but Trump has made significant inroads.

The analysis of recent Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Trump with support from 37% of registered Hispanic voters, up from 30% at the same point in 2020. Harris is at 51% compared to Biden's 54% four years earlier. The numbers are subject to sampling error, and have levels of precision of between 2 and 6 percentage points.
Trump ended up winning 38% of the Hispanic votes in 2020, 21 points below Biden but still the biggest share for a Republican candidate since President George W. Bush won 44% in 2004, according to a 2020 exit poll analysis by the Pew Research Center and historical figures compiled by the American Enterprise Institute.
SHIFT AMONG BLACK MEN
The Republican is also on track to whittle away at the edges of Democrats' strength in the Black electorate. Some 18% of Black men picked him in recent Reuters/Ipsos polls - up from 14% four years earlier - as did 8% of Black women, up from 4%. Exit polls after the 2020 election showed that about 8% of Black voters overall picked Trump in 2020, while the recent Reuters/Ipsos polling shows him at 12%.

Republican campaign strategist Kristin Davison said Trump is wooing Black voters by convincing them that the Democratic Party is too extreme on social issues.
""That's what Trump has been able to do with Black men and with Hispanics in the last four years, not just on the issues of the economy and hard work, but with country and family,"" she said.
America's history of racial tension and injustice looms large in the minds of Trump's supporters and detractors alike. Trump famously asked Black voters during his 2016 presidential campaign, ""What the hell do you have to lose?""
""A lot of people might play the race card. They might say he's racist, they might say he's using Black people. They might say a lot of stuff. But for me, personally, I feel like he proved that he wants to see everybody win,"" said Kedrick Benford, a Black voter in Houston who didn't vote in 2020 but said he thinks he'll vote for Trump this time.
Benford, 30, a self-employed retailer, said he considered Trump more experienced than Harris.
Harris has kept the race close in part by winning over white women, who made up about four in 10 voters in 2020, double the combined share of Black and Hispanic voters.
While the two candidates' shares of support from white men is largely unchanged, Harris' boost among white women means Trump is only leading by nine points with white voters overall, compared to when he led Biden by 14 points with them in 2020.
Davison, the Republican strategist, said many women have turned to Harris in part because Democrats have effectively focused them on abortion following the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling by ending the nationwide right to abortion.
Women are also evaluating ""the stark contrast in leadership and character between the vice president and Trump, which is influencing their choices,"" said Meghan Hays, a Democratic strategist and former senior communications aide to President Biden.
""The vice president must widen her lead among women voters to offset Trump’s advantage with Black and Latino men,"" Hays added. ""This election will be won by the smallest of margins.""
Donna Berg, a white woman in St. Charles, Illinois, voted for Trump in 2016 and again ""reluctantly"" in 2020, but Berg decisively dumped Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack.
""After Jan. 6, it was all over,"" Berg said. She said the Republican Party has veered into extremism under Trump's leadership and she would vote for Harris this year. ""I am not necessarily voting for her as much as I’m voting against Trump.""

Biden's promise of a return to a more humane immigration regime than under Republican former President Donald Trump soon collided with the reality of a spike in illegal border crossings.
The Supreme Court upended the legal landscape around abortion rights by overturning Roe v. Wade, inflaming one of the most divisive issues in American politics.
And despite Biden's pledge that America would serve as a stabilizing force in the world, overseas conflicts have overshadowed his presidency.

Whoever triumphs in the election - Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris - will inherit the legacy of a Biden administration that made good on some promises, saw others swept off-course by events, and others still only partially fulfilled. Here's how Biden fared on the defining issues of his presidency.
IMMIGRATION
Biden, a Democrat, started his presidency by reversing many of Trump’s restrictive immigration policies. He haltedconstruction of Trump’s border wall; rescinded bans targeting people from certain majority-Muslim countries and other nations; and wound down the “remain in Mexico” program, which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as they pursued their U.S. cases.

But months into his presidency, illegal crossings spiked, particularly among unaccompanied children from Central America, overwhelming U.S. border processing centers and fueling Republican criticism.
Illegal crossings reached record levels in 2022 and 2023 as more migrants arrived from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and countries outside the hemisphere.
In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, in 2022 beganbusing arriving migrants north to Democratic cities including New York City and Chicago, which struggled to house them.

In January, Biden backed a bipartisan bill that aimed to tighten border security. After the bill was defeated in the U.S. Senate amid Trump's opposition, Biden in June bannedasylum for most migrants crossing the border illegally.
The number of migrants caught crossing illegally dropped dramatically, undercutting Trump's false claims that Harris and Democrats support an open border.
Despite the political pressures surrounding migration, Biden created new legal pathways for hundreds of thousands of migrants and oversaw the restoration of the U.S. refugee program, which admitted more than 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the most in 30 years.
ABORTION
The biggest upheaval on abortion access in decades occurred during Biden's presidency - but because of a decision by the Supreme Court.
In June 2022, the conservative majority formed by Trump's judicial appointments to the court eliminated the nearly 50-year-old federal right to abortion under Roe v. Wade.
The decision ushered in a period in which individual states set their own laws on abortion access. More than a dozen states banned abortion in all or most cases.
Biden condemned the Supreme Court ruling, and his administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department, laid out guidelines to ensure access to emergency abortion care under federal law and defended the use of the abortion pill before the Supreme Court.
The administration also pushed for expanded access to reproductive health services like contraception through the Affordable Care Act.
The administration won its biggest victory in June when the Supreme Court rejected a case brought by anti-abortion advocates seeking to roll back the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, one of two medications used in the abortion pill regimen.
But the court dismissed on procedural grounds the administration's case arguing that Idaho's severe abortion ban conflicted with a federal law requiring medical providers to offer stabilizing emergency care, including abortions. In October, the court declined to hear a similar administration case about Texas' strict abortion ban.
While devoutly Catholic Biden was openly uncomfortable about abortion from early in his political career, mitigating the impacts of the dissolution of Roe v. Wade has become a pillar of his presidency.
Democrats more broadly made abortion rights central to their platform in the 2022 midterm elections. In March, Harris became the first sitting vice president or president to visit an abortion clinic.
ECONOMY
Joe Biden may go down in history as overseeing the best economy that everyone hated.
Since 2021, as the country emerged from a global pandemic that briefly created historic job losses and brought the economy to a near-standstill, employers have added nearly 16.5 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has averaged just 4.2%, including the longest run at 4% or below since the 1960s.

Gross domestic product growth has averaged 3.2% per quarter, well above what most economists view as the U.S. economy's long-term potential. Incomes and wages have grown above trend. Collective U.S. household net worth has climbed to a record $163.8 trillion, thanks to a booming stock market and rising home values.
But survey after survey over most of Biden's term has shown little of that registering with average Americans. Why? Because all of that occurred against the backdrop of the worst inflation breakout in a generation.
As the economy reopened, a mix of tangled supply chains, worker shortages and hot consumer demand, supported by roughly $5 trillion of government stimulus from Biden's and Trump's administrations, sent prices climbing - fast.
By the summer of 2022, the Consumer Price Index was rising by 9.1% year-over-year and the widely followed gauge of household satisfaction with the economy - the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index - tumbled to a record low.
While inflation has receded and sentiment has begun to recover, surveys show Americans still feel the sting of lingering high prices, and they blame Biden and Democrats for it.
RACIAL JUSTICE
On his first day in the White House, Biden signed an executive order aimed at addressing racism, police brutality, poverty and inequities impacting Black people and other communities of color.
But reform has been slow. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, introduced in 2021 to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics and racial bias, stalled in Congress.
In 2022, Biden issued an executive order directing the Department of Justice to create a national database of misconduct by federal law enforcement officers and requiring federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the use of deadly force or deaths in custody. It also restricted federal agencies from using chokeholds and ""no knock"" entries.
While Biden's Justice Department revived investigations into civil rights abuses, which had largely stopped under Trump, it has failed to secure a single binding settlement in the 12 investigations opened into possible police civil rights abuses since Biden took office.
On the economic front, Black unemployment fell to a historic low last year. This year alone, the administration directed $1.5 billion in loans to Black-owned businesses. It has also invested more than $16 billion in historically Black colleges and universities and distributed $2.2 billion to more than 43,000 Black and other farmers who experienced discrimination. Last year, the Biden administration allocated $470 million to improve maternal health.
FOREIGN POLICY
From wars in Ukraine and Gaza to civil bloodshed in Sudan, overseas conflicts have dominated Biden's foreign policy agenda.
Biden came to office promising to restore U.S. global leadership in the world and determined to push back on an increasingly aggressive China.
In some ways, his administration has done just that. After the chaotic 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Biden rallied U.S. allies the following year to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has also revitalized alliances across Asia to pressure China's leadership.
But the U.S. has struggled to bring the grinding conflicts to an end, and hasn't been able to prevent the deepening ties between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.
Now in its third year, the war of attrition in Ukraine continues despite billions of dollars in U.S. military aid and massive losses on both sides. The conflict is increasingly international, with Western accusations that Moscow is receiving weapons and soldiers from North Korea, missiles and drones from Iran and technical and other support from China.
The war between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, which started when Hamas fighters staged a deadly attack into Israel, has metastasized into conflict between Israel and Lebanese militants Hezbollah and sparked reprisal attacks between Israel and Iran.
Biden's staunch support for Israel has divided his party and undercut the United States' ability to criticize others on human rights and violations of international law.
A conflict in Sudan has triggered ethnic violence and famine conditions in Sudan's Darfur region, where violence about 20 years ago led to the International Criminal Court charging former Sudanese leaders with genocide and crimes against humanity. The United States has been trying to help broker an end to the 18-month-long conflict.
ENERGY TRANSITION
Biden entered the White House with huge ambitions to fight climate change by transitioning the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels to cleaner, renewable sources - all while creating new green, unionized jobs and re-shoring U.S. manufacturing. Among his goals: put an end to federal oil and gas leasing, expand deployments of solar and wind energy to decarbonize the power grid, electrify the nation’s vehicle fleet, and ultimately put the economy on a path to become carbon-neutral by 2050.
On the win side of the ledger, Biden signed into law three pieces of legislation that have driven a massive investment in the clean energy economy: the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act, which aims to establish a domestic semiconductor supply chain that could insulate the domestic energy sector from supply shocks.
Under the IRA, companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in new solar, wind, electric vehicles and infrastructure, battery storage and other climate-friendly projects that have sped up the energy transition and created jobs – largely in Republican states whose lawmakers did not support the legislation.
The administration has awarded $90 billion in grants to climate, clean energy, and other projects under the IRA, or about 70% of the law’s climate-focused grant money, according to administration officials.
The Biden administration also expanded federal leasing for renewable energy projects, and passed new regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.
On the loss side, his administration’s attempts to end federal oil and gas leasing failed in the courts, and his policies failed to prevent a massive surge inU.S. oil and gas output– mostly on privately owned lands in Texas and New Mexico - that has made the U.S. the world’s top petroleum producer.
And in perhaps the best litmus test of Biden’s climate actions, projections from the Rhodium Group show U.S. greenhouse gas admissions set to decline by 32-43% by 2030 under current policies, short of Biden's 50-52% goal.

Nevertheless, opinion polls show Trump, 78, and Harris, 60, virtually even. The winner may not be known for days after Tuesday's vote, though Trump has already signaled that he will attempt to fight any defeat, as he did in 2020.
Both candidates predicted victory as they converged on Pennsylvania on Monday to urge supporters who have not yet cast their ballots to show up on Election Day. The state offers the largest share of votes in the Electoral College of any of the seven battleground states expected to determine the outcome.

Trump also campaigned in North Carolina and Michigan on the final full day of the campaign and was due to return to his home in Palm Beach, Florida, to vote and await election results.
Harris scheduled five campaign stops in Pennsylvania, including two cities where Trump also visited, Reading and Pittsburgh.
She ended the day in Philadelphia with a star-studded event at the ""Rocky steps"" of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the site of a famous scene from the movie ""Rocky.""

Despite enjoying the support of A-list celebrities including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey, both of whom rallied the Philadelphia crowd before Harris took the stage, Harris called herself the underdog who like Rocky was ready to ""climb to victory.""
""The momentum is on our side,"" Harris told a crowd that chanted back, ""We will win.""
""Tonight, then, we finish as we started: with optimism, with energy, with joy,"" Harris said, predicting one of the closest elections in U.S. history.

In Allentown, Harris appealed to the city's substantial Puerto Rican community who were outraged by insults from a comedian at a Trump rally last week. Later she went door-knocking in Reading and held a brief rally in Pittsburgh, where pop star Katy Perry played a set.
Trump led his fourth and final rally after midnight before a packed arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the third presidential election in a row that he has used the city for his last event.
He promoted his signature issues of increasing border security while attacking the economic record of the Biden-Harris years.
It was also likely the last campaign rally of his career, since he has said he does not plan to run for president again should he fail attain the high office in Tuesday's election.
""This is the last one,"" said Trump, estimating he had conducted 930 rallies since he began his first campaign in 2015.

""If we get out our people, it's over, there's nothing they can do about it. ... To make you feel a little guilty, we would only have you to blame,"" added Trump, who received a boost earlier in the night with an endorsement from podcaster Joe Rogan.
GENDER GAP
The Harris campaign says its internal data shows undecided voters are breaking in their favor, and says it has seen an increase in early voting among core parts of its coalition, including young voters and voters of color.
Trump campaign officials said they were monitoring early-voting results that show more women have voted than men. That is significant given Harris led Trump by 50% to 38% among female registered voters, according to an October Reuters/Ipsos poll, while Trump led among men 48% to 41%.
""Men must vote!"" the world's richest person Elon Musk, a prominent Trump supporter, wrote on his X social media platform.
Trump's campaign has outsourced most of the voter outreach work to outside groups, including one run by Musk, which have focused on contacting supporters who do not reliably participate in elections, rather than undecided voters.
A Pennsylvania judge ruled that Musk could continue his $1 million voter giveaway in the state, which a local prosecutor said amounted to an illegal lottery.
Trump has vowed to protect women ""whether the women like it or not"" and said that the decision of whether to ban abortion should be up to individual states, after the conservative majority he cemented on the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 ended the nationwide right to abortion. In Reading, he vowed to keep transgender athletes out of women's sports, as supporters waved pink ""Women for Trump"" signs behind him.
One Trump campaign official said they thought the Republican would carry North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, which would still require him to carry one of battleground states in the Rust Belt - Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania - to win the White House.
Republicans also appeared to be posting strong early-vote results in Nevada, and have been heartened by robust early-voting numbers in the hurricane-ravaged western counties of North Carolina.
""The numbers show that President Trump is going to win this race,"" senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters. ""We feel very good about where things are.""
Trump and his allies, who falsely claim his 2020 defeat was the result of fraud, have spent months laying the groundwork to again challenge the result if he loses. He has promised ""retribution"" if elected, spoken of prosecuting his political rivals and described Democrats as the ""enemy from within.""
Harris campaign officials said his attempts to allege fraud will fail. ""Voters select the president, not Donald Trump,"" Dana Remus, a campaign legal adviser, told reporters.

Worried the political divide will only grow deeper.

Some are turning to religion, others to yoga, swimming or lifting weights. Some are following the news closely, while others have shut off their TVs and smartphones to lose themselves in books or take long walks outdoors.
“I wish my smartphone was smart enough to know I’ve already voted,” said Lynn Nicholson, 72, a Harris voter in Marietta, Georgia, who has found refuge from the deluge of campaign ads through walking, gardening and photography. ""It’s overwhelming.""

Todd Harrison, 49, of Canton, Georgia, a pest control specialist who is leaning toward Trump, said he has stopped watching sports on TV because of the barrage of political ads.
“The closer I get to the election, the madder I get,” Harrison said.
FEARS OF UNREST
Many voters said they worried about what could happen after the election, especially if Trump loses. They fear a wave of lawsuits and court hearings, demonstrations, even violence.
Trump claims the only way Democrats can win is by cheating. Harris has said she is ready to confront Trump if he prematurely declares victory.
Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, a 57-year-old Harris supporter in Detroit, said she is concerned about what Trump's incendiary rhetoric could provoke.
""It's like he's igniting a base of violence in advance,"" she said. ""It's scary.""
But Lillian Hall, a 68-year-old former teacher and retail store owner from Hendersonville, North Carolina, and a Trump supporter, said she was scared there would be rioting if Harris loses.

“I think there'll be anger like we've not seen yet if Trump wins,” Hall said.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last month found widespread worries that the U.S. could see a repeat of the unrest that followed Trump's 2020 election defeat, when the then-president's false claim that his loss was the result of fraud prompted hundreds of followers to storm the U.S. Capitol.
Some 74% of registered voters who responded to the Oct. 16-21 survey said they were concerned extremists would commit acts of violence if they were unhappy with the election results. Democrats were most likely to think that: 90% of them agreed compared with 64% of Republicans and 77% of independents.
A few voters said in interviews they were trying to channel their anxieties by helping to get out the vote for their candidate.
Shirley Easton, an 85-year-old Tucson, Arizona, resident who described her mental state as “scared out of my mind,” said she had been mailing postcards to persuade people to vote for Harris.
Easton said she feared for the future of her seven granddaughters after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 reversed its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
“For my grandchildren, I’m very afraid,"" she said.
Lisa Fields, 60, a marketing professional, was so concerned that she traveled from her Manhattan home on Saturday to knock on doors for Trump in Delaware County, a critical suburb of Philadelphia.
She hopes Trump will bring peace to the Middle East and the country becomes more unified regardless of the victor.
“We need to come together for the greater good. And I'll focus on that the day after, because while I disagree with people voting the other way, they're entitled to and that's the beauty of America,” Fields said.
Other voters said they were trying to disengage from the election as much as possible.
Jean Thomson, 63, an executive coach in Marietta, Georgia, who voted for Harris, said the dozens of political flyers that arrive in the mail go straight into her trash.
“I don’t even look at them,"" she said, adding she was meditating and spending more time in nature to cope with her stress.
Not everyone was headed to the woods.
When the results start rolling in on Tuesday, ""I will be watching with my Xanax and my bottle of sauvignon blanc,"" said Gillian Marshall, a 55-year-old Lyft driver in Scottsdale, Arizona.
Marshall, a Democrat who said she voted for Harris, echoed a sentiment nearly universal across the political divide.
""I just want this nightmare to be over.""

""A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny, and anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it,"" Harris said, in a nod at Trump's efforts, before he won, to sow doubt about the legitimacy of the election.

Trump claims falsely that he won the 2020 election, which he lost to Biden.
Harris encouraged her supporters, especially young people, not to give up even in their disappointment and said: ""Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win.""
Harris rose to the top of the Democratic ticket in July after Biden stepped aside. She brought new-found enthusiasm and cash to the effort, but she struggled to overcome voters' concerns about the economy and immigration.
""I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case.

Don't be fooled by early US vote counts: They might be misleading,"WASHINGTON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Early vote returns in U.S. battleground states may not be a good indicator of whether Democratic candidate Kamala Harris or Republican rival Donald Trump will win, experts say, thanks to vote counting rules and quirks in several key states.
In the 2020 election, some states showed a ""red mirage,"" in which Trump was leading on election night, before a ""blue shift"" saw Democrat Joe Biden overtake him as mail-in ballots favored by more Democratic voters were counted.

Experts had accurately predicted it would happen but Trump still used the shift to amplify his false claims that the election was stolen.
It could happen again this week, especially in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
The opposite – a “blue mirage” apparently showing a strong result for Harris only for a “red shift” to reverse the trend - could also happen this week, especially in North Carolina and Georgia.

Trump’s campaign team has said he plans to declare victory when his team believes he has crossed the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the election. That could be premature, depending on how many votes have yet to be counted and where they come from.
How it all plays out will depend on how and when the large numbers of mail-in or early ballots are processed and counted in the different states.

Another factor is that Democrats tend to live in more populous urban areas, where counting votes takes longer.
There are seven battleground states likely to decide the election, each with its own rules for handling and counting ballots. Here's what to expect on Election Day and beyond:
PENNSYLVANIA
Pennsylvania did not have a clear winner in 2020 for four days after Election Day, as officials sifted through a huge backlog of mail ballots.

The state is among only a handful that do not permit election workers to process or tabulate mail ballots until 7 a.m. ET on Election Day, which means it will likely again take days before the outcome is known.
With more Democrats than Republicans voting by mail, the early results – based on in-person Election Day votes – will probably show Trump ahead, but his lead will likely shrink as more mail ballots are counted.
That pattern in 2020 prompted Trump to falsely claim fraud. This year, a new law requires most counties to announce at midnight on election night how many mail ballots remain to be counted in an effort to forestall conspiracy theories.
WISCONSIN
Like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin does not allow election officials to process or count mail ballots until the morning of the election, which means there can be a delay in reporting the results of those early votes.
In addition, many of the state's largest cities transport mail ballots to a centralized location for processing and tabulating. That can lead to significant batches of votes getting reported all at once in the early morning of Wednesday.
In 2020, Trump and his allies falsely claimed fraud after Milwaukee, the state's largest city, reported nearly 170,000 absentee ballots around 3:30 a.m. CT (0830 GMT), giving Biden a huge spike that moved him into the lead for the first time.
That increase was expected due to the way the city processes those ballots and the fact that Democrats were more likely to vote by mail. A similar pattern is probable in 2024.
GEORGIA
Early in-person voting is popular in Georgia, where officials expected 65% to 70% of ballots to be cast at early poll locations.
Absentee or mail ballots, which may comprise around 5% of the vote, can be processed - which includes steps such as verifying signatures - starting two weeks before the election, though workers must wait until Election Day to begin counting them.
All early votes – in-person and mail – must be counted and reported by 8 p.m. ET (0000 GMT) on election night, according to state law. Officials are aiming to have all votes, including those from Election Day, tallied by midnight.

Ballots from overseas and military voters will be accepted up to three days after the election if postmarked by Nov. 5.
There were more than 21,000 such ballots requested, so an extremely close election might not be resolved until those votes are tabulated.
ARIZONA
Voting by mail is extremely popular in Arizona; nearly 90% of voters cast their ballots early, most by mail, in 2020. Election officials in Arizona can begin processing and tabulating mail ballots upon receipt, but results cannot be released until one hour after polls close.
Any mail ballots dropped off on Election Day itself cannot be processed until the polls have closed. That is often a sizable number – in 2022, those ""late early"" votes comprised one-fifth of all ballots in Maricopa County, the state's largest – and can take days to count.
The initial results on election night should be mostly early votes, which could favor Harris, before the numbers shift toward Trump as Election Day votes are tallied. They could move back toward Harris in the days to follow as late-arriving mail ballots are tabulated.
MICHIGAN
Since the 2020 election, Michigan has instituted early in-person voting for the first time and begun permitting jurisdictions with more than 5,000 people to begin processing and tabulating mail ballots eight days before Election Day.
Smaller jurisdictions can do so the day before Nov. 5.
Officials hope those changes will allow the state to report results more quickly than in 2020, when mail ballots could not be processed in advance.
That created a ""red mirage"" on election night, when the state's early counts of Election Day votes favored Trump. Biden eventually surpassed Trump on the strength of mail ballots, which took longer to tally. Trump falsely claimed he was the victim of fraud.
NORTH CAROLINA
Election officials start processing and scanning mail ballots ahead of Election Day. After polls close, the first reported results will likely be mostly mail ballots as well as early in-person votes.
Election Day votes will be counted and reported throughout the evening, with full results expected by midnight.
Harris may appear to lead early thanks to mail ballots, while Trump could close the gap as Election Day votes are counted.
If the election is as close as polls suggest, the outcome in North Carolina may remain unclear for a week or more. Absentee ballots that arrive on Nov. 5, as well as ballots from overseas and military voters, are tallied during the 10-day canvass period that follows Election Day.
In 2020, media outlets did not call North Carolina for Trump until Nov. 13, 10 days after the election.
NEVADA
Nevada's slow vote counting in 2020 – news outlets did not call the state for Biden until five days after Election Day – launched countless memes, but officials say changes since then should speed up the process.
Most notably, counties were permitted to begin processing and counting mail ballots on Oct. 21.
In addition, workers can start tabulating early in-person votes at 8 a.m. PT (1500 GMT) on Election Day, rather than waiting until polls close.
But Nevada still might not get called swiftly. Mail voting has grown popular in the state, and it is the only battleground that accepts late-arriving mail ballots.
Any ballot postmarked by Nov. 5 will still be counted if it arrives within four days. Those late ballots historically favor Democrats, so a shift toward Harris could occur as votes are counted after Election Day.

It is a frustrating moment for a whirlwind campaign that opened with a huge jump in enthusiasm and cash when she replaced President Joe Biden in July, put on a robust Democratic convention and was widely hailed as the winner of her only debate with Trump.
""This was always going to be a tight race...That doesn’t mean we’re not losing sleep over it,"" said a senior Democratic campaign aide, reflecting what interviews with donors, aides and advisers show is the mood at the White House and the Wilmington, Delaware-based campaign headquarters.

After weeks of focusing on policy and trying to define herself on the national stage, Harris is going back to her prosecutorial posture of July, an adviser said, hoping to demonstrate strength to voters who might be attracted to Trump's strongman image.
At her Monday night rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, she took the rare step of showing clips of Trump's remarks about an ""enemy within"" America to underscore her argument that he poses a danger to the country.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
This week, she sat down with Charlamagne tha God to reach Black men and followed up with a confrontational interview with Fox News to address conservatives. Popular podcaster Joe Rogan and his young, male followers could be next.
Nationally, Harris' edge has narrowed from a late September lead of seven points over Trump to just three, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. More concerning for Democrats: she and Trump are statistically tied in the seven crucial battleground states that will decide the race.

The narrowing polls come as high food and rent prices continue to worry Americans and Trump capitalizes on fears related to migrants crossing the southern border with increasingly extreme rhetoric.
Stock markets just hit record highs and some prominent analysts say Harris' policies would create less debt and spur more economic growth than Trump's would, but polls suggest voters trust Trump more on one of the top election issues - the economy.
""Kamala Harris is the underdog, like she's been saying all along,"" said Democratic strategist Anthony Coley. ""Many folks thought that language was just political posturing ... But it was true when she first said it in July and true now three weeks out.""
Three Trump donors told Reuters in recent days that they were feeling increasingly confident about Trump’s chances, chalking the shift up to Americans' focus on immigration and Trump's flurry of recent rallies and events.
""I was on the phone with the campaign. They’re guardedly optimistic,"" said one donor.
""We just need to win one of the blue wall states, it’s very doable,"" he said, referring to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which would give Trump the White House if he also wins Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina.
Asked about the close race on Wednesday, Harris said: ""This is an election for president of the United States. It’s not supposed to be easy.""
MARGIN OF ERROR RACE
Nationally, Harris has comfortably won back the suburbs and middle class voters that had slipped to Trump in the final months of Biden's campaign, Ipsos/Reuters polling shows.
But internal Harris campaign polls show her within the margin of error in each of the seven battleground states that will help determine the winner, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. In the latest batch, she is tied in Pennsylvania, up slightly in Wisconsin and down in Michigan, one source said.
Support from men of all races - where Harris' numbers lag Biden's - is a major weakness. The campaign's strategy of aiming toward the center and its failure to fully engage with local Democrats is another, some Democrats say.
Voter outreach in Michigan has been subpar, said Byron Nolen, mayor of Inkster, a Detroit suburb, and president of the local Democratic club. He said he had to ask the campaign for yard signs and other basic supplies for local voters.
""In my brain, they could have done Michigan better,"" he said. ""We're still trying to get people excited.""
Harris' focus on Republicans, even as she ignores some Democrats' demands to differentiate herself from Biden's policy of staunch support to Israel, is a concern for others.
Aaron Regunberg, a progressive Democratic politician and former Rhode Island representative, questioned the campaign shift from saying ""Republicans are weird,"" a summertime message about Trump and his running mate JD Vance, to ""Republicans are great, I want them in my cabinet.""
He argues that instead of touting endorsements from Republicans like Alberto Gonzales, a former attorney general under President George W. Bush, Harris should have publicly broken from Biden's Gaza policy to win more support.
With plenty of cash in their coffers, Democrats plan to continue their ground game operation in all seven battleground states and to outspend Trump on digital and television ads. There are no plans right now for Harris to narrow her public appearances to the most critical states.
""Our strategy is to compete everywhere, expand the map, and maximize the number of pathways to victory,"" campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon wrote in a recent email staff and volunteers.
This week Harris makes stops in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, while her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, holds events in Wisconsin, western Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nebraska's second congressional district, where a win could provide a potentially crucial single electoral vote for Harris.
""It's the final stretch in a close election similar to 2016 and 2020,"" said Democratic strategist Donna Brazile. ""I remain cautiously optimistic.""

The sharpest criticism contained accusations that the party had lied to its supporters about President Joe Biden's mental fitness until a disastrous TV debate with Trump in June raised alarm bells and ultimately led to the president exiting the race.
One Democratic donor asked: ""Why did Joe Biden hold on for as long as he did? He should have not concealed his (health) and dropped out a lot sooner.""

Biden, 81, has said privately he thought he was the only Democrat who could beat Trump, and vowed publicly that he was fit to be president for another four years. When he dropped out of the race in July, he said he had decided it was ""in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down.""
Biden's announcement in April 2023 that he would run for reelection was greeted with skepticism by many Democrats, but likely potential challengers quickly agreed to join his campaign as advisers, rather than challenge him.

A Democratic official blamed ""malpractice"" by Biden's inner circle. ""No one would tell him 'no',"" the official said, criticizing the White House communications and political teams. ""So it's Joe, but also Joe's core apparatus. Stunning and well documented chickens coming home to roost.""
One Harris aide said the vice president's campaign was doomed from the start by her loyalty to the unpopular president. Democrats could have won with someone who broke from him, offered different policies, and presented as a candidate of change.

One major error was Harris' initial remark on the ABC show ""The View"" that she could not think of anything she would have done differently from Biden, the aide said.
Other left-leaning governments have also come under fire from conservative political movements that target immigrants. Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, for example, cut immigration levels under criticism from the right, and Europe's far-right parties have vowed to toughen immigration rules, while peeling away votes from the center-left.

That has not stopped calls for a reckoning within the Democratic Party from donors and voters after Harris' loss.
The party ""needs a complete reboot,"" hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a longtime Democratic donor who endorsed Trump in 2024, posted on X. ""The party lied to the American people about the cognitive health and fitness of the president,"" he said, and then didn't hold a primary to replace him.
The Harris campaign and the White House declined to comment.
WOMEN AND YOUNG VOTERS
Concerns about the problems with Harris' run for president ran deeper, though.
Two groups Harris was counting on to beat the former president -- increasingly diverse young voters, believed to be motivated by climate change, liberal values and her social media savvy, and women worried about shrinking abortion rights under a Republican -- moved in Trump's direction instead.
Trump's overall share of voters under 45 was up 2 percentage points from 2020 as was his share of women voters, Edison Research exit poll data show. Trump also increased his support in many suburban areas, where Democrats thought they had made inroads.
The shift came even as the Harris campaign insisted the race was close, and that she was picking up new voters.
One Democratic National Committee official said he was fielding angry text messages from party members late on Tuesday night. ""They feel lied to by the campaign,"" the official said.
Harris' defeat is the Democrats' second bitter loss to Trump over the past three elections. Hillary Clinton's 2016 defeat had paved the way for Biden to run.
""We dug out of a deep hole but not enough. A devastating loss,"" David Plouffe, senior adviser to the campaign, wrote on X, a remark that seemed to reference Biden's weak polls before he dropped out of the race.
A convicted felon, Trump has made unorthodox economic proposals, including blanket tariffs on imports, that may be costly for U.S. consumers and businesses, economists say. His plans to deport millions of people who are in the country illegally would upend industries and communities.
Still, Trump gained with Hispanic voters, and had easy wins in Georgia and North Carolina, states where Democrats thought they were competitive. Harris' whirlwind campaign had banked on a theme of inclusivity in its messaging and stronger fiscal support for families to unify a winning coalition, but fell short.
Biden and Harris' support of Israel during its assault on Gaza split the Democratic Party, with many progressive Democrats calling unsuccessfully for the U.S. to curb its military aid to Israel. That cost votes among left-leaning Democrats.
Harris remained at her residence in Washington all Tuesday evening while crowds waited outside her alma mater Howard University, where the campaign had set up a stage and a media center, anticipating days of vote counting before a result.
She finally arrived at the university campus on Wednesday afternoon to deliver her concession speech, which included thanking Biden.
""While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,"" she said.

Biden says 'garbage' comment not aimed at all Trump supporters,"WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's attempt to call out racist remarks by a speaker at a campaign rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump backfired when Trump and other Republicans accused him of calling their supporters ""garbage.""
Biden was responding on Tuesday to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage"" at the rally on Sunday and also disparaged Black Americans, Jewish people, Palestinians and Latinos.

Trump's campaign distanced itself from the Puerto Rico comment at the event where other Trump allies also made vulgar and racist remarks. Trump himself, who has made a series of inflammatory and racist statements on the campaign trail, on Tuesday called his rally ""an absolute lovefest.""
Speaking on Tuesday during a fundraising Zoom call with Voto Latino, an organization that encourages young Latino Americans to register to vote, Biden said, ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's - his - his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it's un-American,"" according to a transcript posted on X by a White House spokesperson.

The White House transcript included an apostrophe, suggesting the president was referring to one supporter, Hinchcliffe. It was unclear from the sound of the video clip of the call whether Biden meant the plural ""supporters"" as both words sound exactly the same.
Biden sought to clarify his remark soon after it became public.
""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporters at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,"" Biden posted on X late on Tuesday.

""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.""
On Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris vowed to serve &quot;all Americans&quot; if elected president when asked about the remark by Biden, her boss, which distracted from her own rally on Tuesday night and threatened to undercut her message of unity less than a week before the Nov. 5 election.

Republican and Democratic leaders, celebrities and voters have been sharply critical of Hinchcliffe. Biden's use of the word garbage also sparked anger.
Video clips of Biden's remarks circulated on X, formerly Twitter, which is owned by Trump supporter Elon Musk. ""BREAKING: Biden refers to millions of President Trump's supporters as ""garbage,"" Trump War Room claimed on X.
Trump weighed in too. In North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump told a crowd Biden’s comment revealed his disdain for Trump backers.

""Joe Biden finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters. He called them 'garbage.' And they mean it,"" Trump said. ""You can't lead America if you don't love Americans, and you can't be president if you hate the American people.
At Sunday's rally, Trump spoke repeatedly about his plans to halt illegal immigration and deport migrants he described as ""vicious and bloodthirsty criminals"" if he wins the election.
Trump trails Harris by a single percentage point, 43% to 44%, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll.

Trump fraud claims stir concerns of another contested US election,"PHILADELPHIA, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump's false claims about voter fraud in the critical battleground of Pennsylvania have raised concerns he could again try to overturn election results if he fares poorly against Democrat Kamala Harris in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.
Opinion polls, both nationally and in the seven closely divided states, show former President Trump locked in a tight race with Vice President Harris four days before Election Day.

Trump continues to falsely claim his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud in multiple states that Trump lost, while he and his supporters have spread baseless claims about this election.
Trump on Thursday stepped up his unfounded allegations that probes into suspect voter registration forms in Pennsylvania are proof of voter fraud. Some of his supporters alleged voter suppression when long lines formed this week to receive mail-in ballots.

Harris' Democrats, meanwhile, are preparing for the possibility that Trump could try to prematurely claim victory before all votes are counted, as he did in 2020. Their initial plan is to flood social media and news media with calls for calm and patience should he do so.
""We are sadly ready if he does and, if we know that he is actually manipulating the press and attempting to manipulate the consensus of the American people ... we are prepared to respond,"" Harris said in an interview with ABC on Wednesday.

Trump's false claims about voter fraud after the 2020 vote preceded the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters seeking to halt or sway the congressional certification of the electoral votes that determine who becomes president.
""This is sowing the seeds for attempts to overturn an election,"" said Kyle Miller, a strategist with the advocacy group Protect Democracy. ""We saw it in 2020, and I think the lesson Trump and his allies have learned since is that they have to sow these ideas early.""

Trump's allies also have raised concerns that noncitizens could vote in significant numbers, though there are few examples of that happening.
On Friday, several U.S. intelligence agencies said Russia had created a video circulating online that falsely show people from Haiti voting multiple times in the state of Georgia. The video is part of Russia's efforts to undermine confidence in the election and divide Americans, the agencies said.

Georgia's top election official said Thursday the video likely came from a Russian troll farm.
State officials and democracy advocates said incidents in Pennsylvania show a system working as intended. A judge extended the mail-in ballot deadline by three days in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, after the former U.S. president's campaign sued over claims that some voters were turned away before a Tuesday deadline.
Election officials discovered potentially fraudulent registrations in Lancaster and neighboring York counties, prompting investigations by local law enforcement. There is no evidence the applications have resulted in illegal votes.
As the election nears, election officials are scrambling to tamp down misinformation narratives about voter fraud.
In Pennsylvania’s Northampton County, an activist posted a video of someone dropping off a bin of ballots to the county courthouse and saying it was suspicious; it turned out to be a worker for the United States Postal Service “literally just delivering the mail,” said Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt.
The video has been viewed more than five million times on X.
“I feel like that what's most different this year is, is the intentional dissemination of false information that spreads around the globe before we have an opportunity to get the truth out,"" Kathy Boockvar, Pennsylvania former secretary of state, said during a webinar on Friday.
PREPARING TO BLAME A LOSS ON FRAUD
Trump held a rally in Michigan on Friday and was later due to speak in Wisconsin, while Harris spoke in Janesville in Wisconsin and was due later in Milwaukee for a rally featuring rapper Cardi B.
Senior Harris campaign staff say their internal data shows Harris winning battleground state voters who have made up their minds in the last week by double-digit margins.
Trump's New York rally on Sunday, which featured vulgar and racist remarks from allies, was the ""last straw"" for late-breaking undecided voters, according to one Harris campaign official.
Trump tells his rallies to expect a big victory on Tuesday, saying he could only envision losing ""if it was a corrupt election.""
Trump's claims have raised concerns that he is preparing to again blame a potential loss in Pennsylvania, the largest of the seven states likely to decide the result of the election, on voter fraud.
In a social media post on Thursday, he said: ""We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania"" and demanded criminal prosecutions.
The United States' unique method of choosing a president, rooted in the Constitution enacted in 1789, gives Trump an opportunity to seek to undermine election results at the local, state and national level.
In 2020, the Trump team attempted 60 court cases alleging fraud in multiple states, all without success. But the experience has prepared lawyers from both parties for another attempt this year.

"Dollar soars, euro tumbles as Trump wins US presidential election","Nov 6 (Reuters) - The dollar soared to a four-month high on Wednesday after Republican Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, with policies on immigration, tax and trade expected to spur higher U.S. growth and inflation.
Trump beat Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris to retake the White House while Republicans also won a U.S. Senate majority. Control of the House of Representatives remains in question, with Republicans currently holding a majority.

A full sweep by Republicans would allow the party to make larger legislative changes and in turn would likely provoke larger currency moves.
Trump’s policies on restricting illegal immigration, enacting new tariffs, lower taxes and deregulation may boost growth and inflation and crimp the Federal Reserve’s ability to cut rates.
""This can push inflation higher and force the Fed to a slower easing path, which is dollar-positive,"" said Nikos Tzabouras, senior market specialist at trading platform Tradu.
The euro zone, Mexico, China and Canada are viewed as being at risk of potential new tariffs, which may hurt economic growth in the regions. That would widen their interest rate differentials with the United States and weigh on their currencies.

The euro may also be weighed down by political uncertainty in Germany.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz sacked his Finance Minister Christian Lindner on Wednesday after weeks of wrangling over the economic direction of the government.
Newspaper Bild had earlier reported that Lindner had recommended early elections as a solution to the budget impasse, a proposal Scholz had rejected.

“It seems like elements of the market were actually kind of running quite light in terms of risk, so therefore they can be a little bit more patient in terms of entering positions as opposed to feeling like you're the wrong side of something and having to exit a position at a speed,” he said.
A complicating factor for the dollar outlook longer term, meanwhile, could be that Trump has stated a preference for a weak U.S. currency.

“Both this year, but also during his previous stay at the White House, he had essentially challenged the longstanding strong dollar mantra, because he prefers a weaker currency to help with exports and American economic activity,"" said Tzabouras.
""And he had also called for lower interest rates, so this could actually pose headwinds for the dollar in the long run as these policies begin to take shape.”

The dollar index was last up 1.66% at 105.09 and reached 105.44, the highest since July 3. The euro dropped 1.78% to $1.0735 and got as low as $1.0683, the lowest since June 27.

The Japanese yen could now approach levels that prompted officials to intervene and shore up the currency earlier this year.
Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said on Wednesday that the government intended to closely watch moves on the foreign exchange market, including speculative moves, with a higher sense of urgency.
Trump has also expressed favorable views on cryptocurrencies, which helped to lift bitcoin more than 10% to a record high of $76,134.
The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Thursday and investors will also watch for any new clues on whether the U.S. central bank could pause cuts in December.
A much stronger-than-expected jobs report for September led investors to pare back expectations on how many times the Fed is likely to cut rates. A much weaker-than-anticipated report for October has raised some doubts over this view though this data was clouded by the impact of recent hurricanes and labor strikes.
Traders are now pricing 71% odds the Fed will also cut in December, down from 77% on Tuesday, according to the CME Group’s Fed Watch Tool.
The Bank of England is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, while the Riksbank is seen easing by 50 basis points and the Norges Bank is expected to stay on hold.

Kamala Harris made a historic dash for the White House. Here’s why she fell short.,"In a meeting with one of America’s most powerful unions in September at its Washington headquarters, Vice President Kamala Harris said she’d protect union jobs and workers’ livelihoods better than Donald Trump.

His advisers fretted about letting ‘Trump be Trump.’ He won anyway.

But leaders of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, long staunchly allied with her Democratic Party, appeared unconvinced. When Harris argued that her Republican rival was no champion of the working class, the union bosses grilled her, questioning whether she and President Joe Biden had done enough for union workers, according to a Teamster leader who recounted the Sept. 16 meeting to Reuters. Within days, the union publicly embarrassed Harris by declining to endorse a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1996.
In the wake of Harris' loss of the 2024 presidential election, her tense exchange with union leaders underscores a critical failure of her campaign: connecting with working-class voters anxious about the economy and high prices.

Following Biden’s dramatic withdrawal just months before Election Day, Harris threw her campaign together as if it were an airplane being built while in flight, her advisers told reporters. The 60-year-old former prosecutor and U.S. senator pressed a case that Trump was a threat to democracy and women’s rights, while promoting a populist economic platform and reproductive freedoms.
Her entrance upended a race that her party had looked set to lose. She made history as the first woman of color at the top of a major party ticket. She triggered a surge in enthusiasm, broke fundraising records – raising $1 billion in less than three months – and drew endorsements from celebrities ranging from pop star Taylor Swift to actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

But Harris’ campaign ultimately failed to overcome deep-seated voter concerns about inflation and immigration – twin issues that opinion polls showed favored Trump. Her loss underscores a profound shift in American politics over the past decade as blue-collar voters have turned increasingly Republican – a trend Trump appears to have accelerated.
Harris also struggled to counter another Trump-era trend: a torrent of misinformation unprecedented in modern U.S. elections. An avalanche of misrepresentations and falsehoods about her record was spread by the former president and amplified on right-wing websites and media, including conspiracy theories on issues ranging from migrant crime to voter fraud.

When asked by Reuters during the race about misinformation amplified by Trump, his campaign officials typically either repeated the falsehoods or did not respond to requests for comment.
By late Wednesday, Trump had won 294 electoral votes to Harris’ 223, with several states yet to be counted. In her concession speech, she told supporters, many of them in tears, not to give up even in their disappointment. “Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn’t mean we won’t win,” she said.
This account of how Harris lost is based on Reuters interviews with Harris campaign staffers, White House officials, Democratic Party advisors and close allies.
It was always going to be a heavy lift. The U.S. has only elected one president – Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 – who wasn’t a white man. As the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, Harris had risen higher in the country’s leadership than any other woman.

The only other woman to get as close as she did – Hillary Clinton, defeated by Trump in 2016 – staked her candidacy in part on becoming the first female president. In the wake of Clinton’s loss, Harris resisted putting her identity at the center of her campaign, said close aides and advisors. Instead, she tried to galvanize voters on issues that mattered to women and Black voters in the election – from abortion rights to middle-class tax cuts and housing affordability.

But those messages struggled to break through at a time when many voters were fixated on rising consumer prices during the first three years of the Biden administration.
“Despite fairly strong economic growth, especially after a major global pandemic, most Americans weren’t feeling like they were getting ahead economically,” said Melissa Deckman, a political scientist and chief executive of Public Religion Research Institute, a nonpartisan research firm. “The Harris campaign did not necessarily do a good job of explaining how her policies would help the middle class, or at least that message wasn’t really resonating with a lot of voters.”
A majority of voters said they trust Trump more to handle the economy, with 51% saying they did so compared to 47% for Harris, according to a preliminary national exit poll conducted by data provider Edison Research. And the voters who identified the economy as their primary concern voted overwhelmingly for Trump over Harris - 79% to 20%.
The economy proved to be a much bigger concern among voters than reproductive rights, with 31% of voters saying the economy mattered most in deciding how to vote compared with 14% who cited abortion. The election also saw a large gender gap. Harris won 54% of women voters in the country, while Trump won 44%, the preliminary exit polls showed.

The Harris and Trump campaigns and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” Trump said early on Wednesday to a roaring crowd of supporters at the Palm Beach County Convention Center.
ELECTORAL GOLD
The election was punctuated by dramatic twists, including two assassination attempts against Trump and the stunning decision by Biden to abandon his re-election bid on July 21.
Democrats coalesced behind Harris with astonishing speed, locking up her party’s nomination within two weeks, excited by her potential to flip the generational argument on Trump. Two decades her senior, Trump had successfully cast the 81-year-old Biden as a frail and confused old man. She would turn that on its head, many Democrats hoped.

Some Democratic strategists questioned the wisdom of one of her first big decisions: picking Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as running mate over Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a deft speaker with proven political strength in a must-win state. Her campaign had hoped the gun-owning Walz, a liberal policy champion and plain-speaking National Guardsman from the Midwest, would help her win over rural white voters.
Walz had generated buzz before Harris picked him by branding Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, as “weird” on national television in July, winning Democratic hearts and media attention. Later, though, Walz gained unwelcome attention for misstatements of his biography, including his military service, and for an uneven debate performance against Vance.
Walz and Vance didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Still, the Harris campaign believed her signature issues – reproductive rights and Trump’s divisiveness – would energize a coalition of women, Black voters, young Americans, independents and “Never Trump” Republicans, sweeping her to the White House.
Well before the race began, Harris emerged as a spokesperson for abortion rights. When the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 officially reversed Roe v. Wade, declaring the constitutional right to abortion no longer existed, the setback for women’s reproductive rights created an unexpected opening for Harris.
The ruling catapulted her from the political periphery into the heart of America’s culture wars. Opinion polls showed most Americans disapproved of the court’s decision – and Harris became the face of an issue that Democratic strategists saw as electoral gold.

For the first time in Biden’s presidency, he handed a decisive issue entirely to his vice president. She went on the road, speaking forcefully on a subject that played an outsized role in helping Democrats stave off an expected bloodbath in the 2022 congressional elections. After the midterms, with the Democrats having held the Senate and swung to a slight minority in the House of Representatives, Harris was now seen as a viable future leader in the party.
Still, even after Biden stepped aside, concerns lingered among some top White House aides over the former San Francisco district attorney’s political skills – including a perception that she hadn’t made a mark as VP, her short-lived campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination and her limited experience courting conservative voters in battleground states. Some also questioned whether she could overcome the long history of racial and gender discrimination in the U.S.
Despite fairly strong economic growth, especially after a major global pandemic, most Americans weren’t feeling like they were getting ahead economically.

After securing the nomination, Harris initially put many of those concerns to rest. She revitalized a beleaguered Democratic campaign, attracting record-high funding and a groundswell of support. She soon moved ahead of Trump in the polls, a sign she was sparking enthusiasm among voters, particularly among women. Trump had previously been seen as the frontrunner, partly based on his perceived strength on the economy after several years of high inflation under Biden.
She aced her first big test – a Sept. 10 televised debate against Trump.
As Harris’s team prepared for what would be her only in-person face-off with Trump, they focused on ways to unnerve the former president and draw attention to his frequent falsehoods on policies, according to several aides involved in the preparations. Harris holed up in Pittsburgh with advisers and conducted mock debates for the prime-time showdown, the aides said.
The strategy paid off. Harris appeared to get under her rival’s skin during the debate. She pressed Trump on the economy, Ukraine, healthcare, the January 2021 Capitol riots and abortion, leaving him rattled and struggling to respond.

Fundraising spiked: Her campaign said it raised $47 million in the 24 hours after the debate. Most voters thought Harris had won, polls showed. Trump shot down offers for another debate, claiming he’d already beaten her.
On the campaign trail, Harris mocked Trump’s debate performance, including his comment that he had “concepts of a plan” to replace a federal health care law. As she gained in polls, Harris’ campaign believed she was opening up states that had been out of reach for Biden, including North Carolina, where the president had his narrowest loss against Trump in 2020 and where she was drawing even in the polls with Trump.
‘IT COULD COST US THE ELECTION’
North Carolina was the scene of her next big test, the late September Hurricane Helene, one of the deadliest storms to hit the U.S. in the last 50 years. The storm shifted focus from messages at the foundation of Harris’ campaign to the handling of the disaster by the Biden-Harris administration.
It hit just as her lead was narrowing. Trump went on the attack, criticizing the Democratic administration’s response to the disaster and tying it to his strongest issue, immigration. As the death toll rose and swathes of North Carolina lay devastated, Trump amplified and spread falsehoods, including a claim that Harris spent disaster-assistance money on housing illegal migrants.
In response to a recent request for comment by Reuters about false claims about how disaster funds were being used, the Trump campaign repeated accusations that money had been spent on housing migrants in the country illegally.
Harris cut short a campaign swing and flew to Washington on Sept. 30 for a briefing on Biden’s emergency response. On her plane, three staffers sat on the floor, ripping apart briefing books, replacing the pages with new notes, a Reuters reporter witnessed.
The disaster, which killed more than 200 people, marked a shift in the race, as misinformation around the administration’s response and Trump’s hardline rhetoric on immigration gained traction. The baseless claims included that the government covered-up deaths, confiscated charitable donations and diverted disaster funds to help immigrants. Harris’ campaign struggled to address both the false claims and voters’ concerns about an uptick in illegal border crossings during Biden’s presidency.
One jurisdiction that illustrated the risks for Harris was Buncombe County, a North Carolina Democratic stronghold of about 280,000 people hammered by the storm. In its aftermath, Democrats stopped targeting potentially persuadable Republican voters there because of concerns they had become too hostile amid the misinformation, Kathie Kline, Buncombe County Democratic chair, told Reuters. In the end, Trump won the state.
As the race tightened through October, and polls indicated a toss-up, alarm spread among Democratic strategists.
They focused on shoring up the so-called Blue Wall of Democratic states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Eight years ago, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton, he breached the Blue Wall by winning all three states, each by less than a percentage point. In 2020, Biden won them back. Holding the Blue Wall now was Harris' best path to the White House, the strategists reasoned. But they had a problem: Michigan and the Gaza War.

Michigan’s large population of Arab Americans and Muslims helped cement Biden’s 2020 victory in the state. Trump turned off many of these voters in his first term, in part by banning immigration to the U.S. from a number of Muslim countries early in his tenure.
In the race’s final stretch, Muslim and Arab-American voters told Reuters they were disappointed Harris did not distance herself more from Biden’s unwavering support of Israel during the Gaza war. In the final weeks, Trump aggressively courted their vote. Many said they would sit out the election or vote Republican.
Harris staffers knew that disillusioned Muslim and Arab-American Democrats were a risk. “It could cost us the election,” said a senior Michigan operative for Harris in July.
The campaign ultimately concluded it was impossible to fully win back those voters. To offset their loss, campaign officials said they focused in the final weeks on marshaling enough support from union workers and Black voters in Detroit, the nation’s largest Black-majority city.
ECONOMIC THREATS
But few issues threatened Harris like inflation.

What About Inflation?

Her campaign had hoped the economic recovery from the pandemic would be a winning issue. Growth is markedly more robust in the U.S. than in other major industrial nations. Stock-market indexes are near record highs.
Instead, the issue eroded Democratic support throughout much of 2024 as union workers and non-college-educated white voters broke for Trump, polls showed. Sharp increases in housing and food costs frustrated voters, overshadowing a strong job market. Trump blamed Harris for the spike during her and Biden’s time in office.
While most unions have long supported Democratic candidates, rank-and-file workers in recent years have moved behind Trump, proving a decisive factor in his victory. There were some positive signs for Harris. The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions, saw a surge in female members supporting Harris and willing to volunteer for her, AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler told Reuters.
In the final weeks of the race, Harris’ momentum appeared to have stalled, with polls showing her edge over Trump narrowing. By mid-October, the race was a dead heat in crucial states.

A pronounced gap in polling between men and women had emerged, too. While Harris cut away at the Republicans’ longstanding edge with white voters overall by gaining ground with white women, Trump appeared to be boosting his advantage with men.
Harris shifted strategy in an attempt to win over more men and Republicans. The campaign dispatched running mate Walz on a tour in mid-October to reach male voters. Harris also held campaign events with former lawmaker Liz Cheney, one of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics and one of the most prominent conservatives to endorse the Democrat. Days later, Trump suggested Cheney should face gunfire in combat, drawing outrage among Democrats and pundits.

The vice president also sharpened her attacks on Trump. In an Oct. 29 speech billed as her closing argument, Harris warned of the dangers of another Trump presidency. He was “unstable” and sought “unchecked power,” she told a rally held at the spot in Washington where Trump addressed his supporters before they attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. With a well-lit White House behind her, she cast herself as a defender of democracy, unity and freedom.
She also sought to reassure voters about the cost of living. Trump’s proposals to raise tariffs would amount to “a 20% national sales tax” on imported goods, she said. She vowed to “protect hard-working Americans who aren’t always seen or heard.”

Biden urges Americans to 'bring down the temperature' after Trump's US election win,"WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden urged Americans to ""bring down the temperature"" on Thursday following Republican Donald Trump's election victory and sought to console fellow Democrats who were alarmed by the former president's stunning comeback.
""Setbacks are unavoidable. Giving up is unforgivable,"" Biden said at the White House Rose Garden as he addressed staff who were disappointed in Vice President Kamala Harris' defeat. ""A defeat does not mean we are defeated.""

Biden said Tuesday's election had proven the integrity of the U.S. electoral system and pledged an orderly transfer of power - an implicit rebuke of Trump, who sought to overturn his 2020 defeat to Biden and raised baseless claims of fraud during this year's campaign as well.
""Something I hope we can do no matter who you voted for is see each other not as adversaries but as fellow Americans, bring down the temperature,"" Biden said. ""I also hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system. It is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent. And it can be trusted, win or lose.""

Biden invited Trump to come meet at the White House -- a courtesy Trump did not offer to Biden in 2020 -- and Trump's campaign said the president-elect would go. In the weeks ahead, Trump will select personnel to serve under his leadership.
Some Democrats have blamed Biden, 81, for Harris' defeat, saying he should not have sought reelection. Biden only dropped his reelection bid in July after a disastrous TV debate with Trump raised alarm bells about his mental fitness.

""We lost this battle. The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up,"" he said.
Harris sought on Wednesday to console supporters. Like Biden, she promised to aid Trump's transition before his inauguration on Jan. 20 but urged Democrats to continue to fight for what they believe in.
Some Democrats worried the loss means their values – left-leaning, socially liberal – are now firmly a minority among Americans. Others were frustrated with the party's leadership, who they said had lost touch with voters who wanted help with the high cost of living.

Biden did not address his role in the election or criticism from members of his party. He has said repeatedly that he ran for office in 2020 to ""restore the soul of America"" from the chaos around Trump. Biden's own legacy now will be bookended by the Republican's return instead.
DECISIVE VICTORY
Trump's victory, surprisingly decisive after opinion polls had shown a neck-and-neck contest, underscored how disenchanted Americans had become with the economy - in particular inflation - along with border security and the direction of the country and its culture.
Hispanics, traditionally Democratic voters, and lower-income households hit hardest by inflation helped fuel Trump's victory.
Harris' campaign pressed the message that Trump was unfit to serve again as president, as a convicted felon and one whose false claims of voting fraud inspired a mob to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden.
The former president will face far fewer limits on his power in his second White House term, as the head of a Republican Party that he has remade in his image over the last eight years.
Republicans wrested the U.S. Senate from Democrats in Tuesday's vote, ensuring Trump's party will control at least one chamber of Congress next year. Republicans also held an edge in the battle for the House of Representatives, though 38 of the 435 races still had no winner.
Trump prevailed in five of the seven battleground states to give him at least 295 Electoral College votes, more than the 270 needed to win the presidency. He was leading in the remaining two, Arizona and Nevada, where votes were still being tallied.
Trump was also on track to become the first Republican presidential candidate to win the highest number of votes nationally since George W. Bush two decades ago. He lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 but secured enough Electoral College votes to win the White House.
World stocks gained on Thursday after a record rise for U.S. shares overnight, and U.S. Treasuries remained under pressure as investors processed the impact of a second Trump presidency.
Wall Street executives expected smaller government, broad deregulation as well as tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, although fresh tariffs could bring challenges in the form of a higher deficit and inflation.
PERSONNEL PICKS
Among people who may figure in Trump's leadership, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a prominent Trump donor, has been promised a role in his administration, as has former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson and investor Scott Bessent were seen as possible cabinet officers in his administration, while former Trump officials Robert O'Brien and Mike Pompeo could return to office.
On trade, Trump is expected to revive policies he favored during his first term, notably tariffs that he has called the ""most beautiful word.""
That could set him on a collision course with China, which has the world's second-largest economy, sow discord with allies and roil global industries from automakers to chipmakers.
Chinese President Xi Jinping sent Trump a congratulatory message and said he hopes the two powers will coexist peacefully, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was among world leaders congratulating Trump. But Trump has been critical of U.S. assistance for Ukraine in its war with Russia. He has said he could end the war in 24 hours but has not said how.
The White House plans to rush billions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine before Biden leaves office in January, sources said on Wednesday, hoping to shore up the government in Kyiv before Trump takes over.

"Oil settles lower as US dollar surges, investors take stock of Trump victory","HOUSTON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices settled lower on Wednesday as investors weighed a strong U.S. dollar against the potential that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's foreign-policy plans could squeeze global oil supply.
Brent crude oil futures settled down 61 cents, or 0.81%, at $74.92 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled down 30 cents or 0.42%, to $71.69.

Trump's election triggered a large sell-off that pushed oil prices down by more than $2 per barrel during early trade as the U.S. dollar rallied, currently at its highest level since September 2022.
The U.S. and Ukraine have signed a deal to give the United States preferential access to new Ukrainian minerals deals and fund investment in Ukraine's reconstruction.




A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities such as oil more expensive for holders of other currencies and tends to weigh on prices.
""All the excitement and initial selling enthusiasm has since waned, and I think there is more upside rather than downside in the short term,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group, noting that investors on Wednesday looked more at the short-term supply, demand outlook.

Trump's reelection could also mean the renewal of sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, removing barrels from the market, which would be bullish, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.
Iran is an OPEC member with production of around 3.2 million barrels per day, or 3% of global output.
However, a crackdown on Iran may be more difficult as the country has become adept at evading sanctions, Alex Hodes, oil analyst at brokerage firm StoneX, said in a note.

Trump's support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could heighten instability in the Middle East, according to Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.
That could boost oil prices as investors price in a potential disruption to global oil supplies. Trump is expected to continue arming Israel.
But setting aside the U.S. election and geopolitical uncertainties, persistent trends in oil markets are likely to shape the outlook ahead, Mukesh Sahdev, global head of commodity markets, oil at Rystad Energy, said in a note.

OPEC+ still pulls the strings, refinery margins battle weaker demand, and higher supply and oil trade flows continue to battle inefficiencies, according to Sahdev.
U.S. crude oil, gasoline and distillate inventories rose last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.
Crude inventories climbed by 2.1 million barrels to 427.7 million barrels in the week ending Nov. 1, the EIA said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.1-million-barrel rise.

"Trump steps up attacks on Harris; Usher, Lizzo add star power to Harris push","ATLANTA/LATROBE, Pennsylvania, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump escalated his verbal attacks on Democrat Kamala Harris on Saturday as the vice president turned to celebrities to generate enthusiasm for her campaign, with both candidates for U.S. president courting early voters.
Harris and Trump are essentially tied in the most competitive states and many Americans are voting early by mail or in person, with just 17 days until the Nov. 5 election.

On Saturday, Harris rallied supporters at a get-out-the-vote event in Detroit, Michigan, for the city's first day of early voting, alongside Detroit-born rapper Lizzo, who said voting was crucial in a state where thin margins can determine elections.
In Atlanta later, Harris appeared with pop singer Usher.
""This is the swing state of all swing states, so every single last vote here counts,"" Lizzo said. She rejected the argument by some that America was not ready for a woman president, saying, ""It's about damn time,"" riffing on one of her biggest hits.

Votes in a handful of swing states, where candidates from both parties have strong support and electoral results have been close in past cycles, are likely to decide the election.
In Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Trump escalated his personal attacks on Harris, a practice some of his advisers fear could alienate swing voters.
Trump said Harris is further to the left than Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

“You have to tell Kamala Harris that you’ve had enough, that you just can’t take it anymore. We can’t stand you, you’re a shit vice president.”
As the crowd applauded, Trump added: “Kamala, you’re fired, get the hell out of here, you're fired.”
Trump had billed his Latrobe event as the start of his final argument to voters but quickly went off script with a long story about hometown hero Arnold Palmer that included an off-color comment about the genitalia of the late golf legend.

""He took showers with the other pros, they came out of there and said 'oh my God, that's unbelievable,'"" he said.
The Harris campaign quickly seized on the comments.
""Trump's Pennsylvania closing argument is literal junk. In a Pennsylvania rally speech his campaign team billed as 'the beginning of his closing argument in the final stretch,' Donald Trump focused on the issue most important to voters in this election: a deceased golfer’s … anatomy,"" the campaign said in a statement.

In both Detroit and Atlanta, Harris urged her supporters to put in an all-out effort to win.
""On Election Day, we don't want to have any regrets about what we could have done these next 17 days,"" she told about 300 voters who planned to march together to an early-voting site.
She said early voting had already set records in Georgia and North Carolina, and challenged Detroit - a city known for producing musical recordings - to follow suit.
Harris' next stop was Atlanta, Georgia, for a rally with another music icon, Usher, who took a break from a three-date concert tour in the southern city to urge voters to go door-to-door and enlist their neighbors and friends to vote.
""Every call matters. Every conversation matters. All of it makes a difference in closing this race ... Everything that we do in the next 17 days will affect the future of our children, of our grandchildren, of the people who we love the most,"" he said.
Harris, speaking before some 11,000 people at a music venue in Atlanta, hammered Trump for a second straight day for cancelling events and for avoiding another presidential debate because of what she called ""exhaustion.""
""When he does answer a question or speak at a rally, have you noticed he tends to go off-script and ramble, and generally for the life of him, cannot finish a thought?"" she said. ""He has called it 'the weave.' But I think we here will call it nonsense.""
Harris will need strong results in the majority non-white cities of Detroit and Atlanta and their surrounding suburbs to repeat President Joe Biden's 2020 wins in Michigan and Georgia.
Trump is seeking to take advantage of what he felt was an improved position for him in opinion polls that show a deadlocked race. Some voters already have mail-in ballots in the state, which is the biggest prize on Election Day among battleground states and could tip the 2024 race.
Early voting also starts on Saturday in Nevada, where former President Barack Obama plans to campaign for Harris in Las Vegas.
Both 2024 candidates spent Friday in closely contested Michigan, trading jabs about their fitness for office. Trump, 78, dismissed accusations from Harris that he was exhausted by the pace of the campaign's closing days. Harris turns 60 on Sunday.
Trump said he had not canceled any events. But an Oct. 22 National Rifle Association of America event in Savannah, Georgia, that he had planned to attend, was canceled, according to organizers.

The recent attacks were among at least 300 cases of political violence identified by Reuters since Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, including at least 51 incidents this year. With just two weeks to go before the Nov. 5 presidential election, the cases are part of the biggest andmost sustained increase in U.S. political violence since the 1970s.
Some of the violence has been reported widely, most notably two assassination attempts on Trump, a Republican. Other high-profile incidents include three shootings in recent weeks at a Democratic campaign office for Harris in Arizona.

But Reuters documented scores of other cases on contentious political issues – from election disputes to LGBTQ+ rights and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Incidents ranged from small fights over political signs to more violent brawls and property destruction at rallies. Most of this year's violence wasn't fatal with the exception of two deaths: a spectator killed during July’s attempt on Trump’s life and the shooter.

The pace of cases has remained remarkably consistent since beginning to rise in 2016, around the time of Trump’s first presidential run. In 2021, which included the tumult that followed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, there were 93 cases of political violence, followed by 79 in 2022, and 76 in 2023.
Political extremism experts warn that the charged atmosphere around the 2024 presidential election has created a highly volatile situation. Trump in particular often uses incendiary rhetoric, threatening to put his political enemies on trial and to deploy the military against the “radical left”, calling them “the enemy within.”

Americans are starting to see violence as “part of the way politics happens,” said Nealin Parker, who heads Common Ground USA, a nonprofit that studies ways to bridge America's political and cultural divides. In the current climate of mistrust, she added, “incidents of violence can metastasize into something bigger.”
Robert Pape, a University of Chicago professor who studies political violence, expressed concern over the prospect of post-election violence in battleground states, where the margin of victory could be a few thousand votes. He likened it to “a wildfire season” with lots of “dry combustible material” and the “potential for lightning strikes.”
Trump himself has declined to rule out the possibility of violence if he loses in November. When asked by Time magazine in April if he expected violence after the election, he said, “If we don’t win, you know, it depends.” He has told supporters that any loss in this year’s race would be due to fraud.
The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign, when asked about the steady rise of political violence and the recent attacks against Harris and Trump supporters, provided a statement attacking Harris on immigration and criminal justice reform.
“DOING MY PART”
The highest-profile case of recent political violence was the first assassination attempt on Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was killed at the scene. He had no “definitive ideology,” federal investigators concluded.
Law enforcement agencies were put on alert for potential retaliatory violence by Trump supporters. There were some concerning incidents, including a man in Florida who told his wife he was “preparing for war” after the shooting and left home with multiple guns, according to police reports. He was found burying a full ammunition box in a public park. Police seized seven rifles and handguns, and had the man hospitalized for a mental health evaluation.
But the anger wasn’t confined to Trump’s supporters.
On the day of the assassination attempt, Joshua Kemppainen, an avowed Trump hater in northern Michigan, raged in a private chat with friends on the Discord messaging app. “Nice aim dickhead,” Kemppainen wrote over a picture of a bleeding Trump. A member of the chat group shared the message with Reuters.
Kemppainen, 22 and unemployed, went on a vandalism spree eight days later in his town of Hancock, population 4,500, which mostly backed Trump in the 2020 election.
On July 21, when President Joe Biden quit the presidential race and endorsed Harris, Kemppainen rode an all-terrain vehicle through the streets and targeted Trump supporters, said Hancock Police Department chief Tami Sleeman in an interview.
Reuters pieced together what happened from police reports obtained in a records request, copies of chat messages provided by Kemppainen’s associates and police, and a video Kemppainen posted on Discord.
He vandalized a pickup truck with a Trump sticker, deflating its tires, tearing off a side mirror and smashing its windows. He also damaged a truck with a pro-police decal. He posted a video of one attack on Discord with the comment “doing my part.” Then he tore up Trump yard signs and threw them into the street.
When an onlooker, Carl Nelson, 81, replanted the signs, Kemppainen ran him over with the ATV and fled, hospitalizing the Vietnam veteran.
The next day, Kemppainen rang Hancock Police: “I am calling to confess to a crime,” he said in a message describing his rampage, according to a recording police shared with Reuters. “So if you could send someone to pick me up. I appreciate it.""

When police heard the voicemail two hours later, they worried the caller sounded unbalanced and dispatched six officers, said Sleeman, the chief. By the time they arrived, Kemppainen had fatally shot himself with an assault rifle, a police report said. His father said Kemppainen was on anti-depression medication and also had an autism diagnosis, the report added. In an interview, a family member confirmed that Kemppainen struggled with mental health issues.
Nelson, who Kemppainen attacked, told Reuters he spent several days in the hospital for knee and upper body injuries. “This was such a peaceful area,” said Nelson. He has decided to vote for Trump, he added.
On Sept. 15, a second assassination attempt on Trump refocused attention on the risk of political violence in this year’s election. Suspect Ryan Routh had waited for hours with an assault rifle by Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach when an agent spotted him in shrubbery and fired. Routh fled and was apprehended quickly.
Eleven days later, in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Alan Vandersloot, a 74-year-old local borough councilman, stood with a Harris sign among about a dozen of her supporters at a rally in York, a city of nearly 45,000 in a county that broadly backed Trump in 2020.
As the rally was ending, Vandersloot told Reuters, a man grabbed him from behind and slammed him to the pavement, opening a two-inch gash on his forehead. The attacker, Robert Trotta, punched Vandersloot repeatedly before fleeing, two witnesses said in interviews.
When another rallygoer, Dan Almoney, gave chase, Trotta called him “a n—- supporter,” Almoney said. Almoney interpreted the slur as a reference to Harris and her backers, he said. Trotta, Vandersloot and Almoney are white.
Trotta, unable to post bail, has yet to make a plea on assault and harassment charges, court records show. His lawyer declined to comment. Trotta is a registered Republican, according to state records. His social media posts, from an account last active in 2020, supported Trump and criticized Democrats.
A York City Police Department spokesperson, Captain Daniel Lentz, said he didn’t believe Trotta’s attack was “politically motivated” because Trotta previously pleaded guilty to two cases of harassment in which he struck random people. The police report, however, did not include statements from Vandersloot and Almoney, who both said they believed the attack was political. Lentz said he didn’t know why the police didn’t record their accounts.
NEW ISSUES, NEW VIOLENCE
There’s no government data on political violence, though several universities and private research groups track it in various ways, typically using databases built on news accounts. Some include random hate crimes; others, including Reuters, do not. Most have not released comprehensive data since 2020.
The 300 cases identified by Reuters were culled from records on thousands of violent crimes since the 2021 Capitol attack. Most of that data was captured initially by the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project, a global violence-tracking project run by a nonpartisan research group in Wisconsin. Reporters identified additional cases using news databases, court filings and police reports obtained through public records requests.
Some of the cases don’t break down along traditional partisan lines, including those linked to disputes over the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
That was the case last month when Caleb Gannon, a pro-Palestinian critic of U.S. government support for Israel, began heckling a pro-Israel rally in Newton, Massachusetts. Cell phone video shows Gannon shouting, “You’re supporting genocide!” before running into the crowd and tackling Scott Hayes, a fervent backer of Israel.
Earlier this year, Hayes, an Iraq War veteran, posted a photo on social media of a handgun with a Star of David pendant and the message “Hey Jew Haters. Bring it.” As they wrestled on the ground, Hayes shot Gannon in the abdomen.
Hayes, 47, is awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The county prosecutor has said an assault and battery charge also will be pursued against Gannon, 31, who remains hospitalized. Hayes’ lawyer said he will argue self-defense but declined further comment.
Other cases are directly linked to the election.
On Sept. 26, a Michigan man was arrested for assaulting a U.S. Postal Service worker who delivered a Harris campaign mailer to his house. The postal worker was in her truck when Russell Valleau, 61, approached on a bike, yelling that he “did not want that ‘Black bitch’ in his mailbox,” according to police records and a statement from the Oakland County prosecutor.
When the postal worker, who is Black, told Valleau to back away, he called her a “Black bitch” and lunged at her with a knife, according to her account to the Farmington Hills Police Department. She sprayed him with dog repellent, and he retreated. “I just had a man come to me with a knife and try to stab me,” she said moments later in a call to police, according to a recording obtained through a records request. “I sprayed him.”
Police reported finding Valleau lying in a nearby yard, apparently intoxicated and suffering the effects of chemical repellant. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and battery and ethnic intimidation. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
In another case this summer, four white men in a pick-up truck rolled up to a rural home in coastal North Carolina and asked three Black teens in the yard “if they liked Donald Trump,” according to a report from the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office. When the youths said, “No,” the report said, the men opened fired with a BB gun, hitting one youth in the leg and another in the buttocks. The shots also broke windows on the house, a shed and a car out front.
The truck drove off. Police are investigating the case as an assault with a deadly weapon and have no suspects. The children suffered minor injuries and declined medical treatment.
Christian Gilyard, the youths’ father, said political tensions have become more pronounced since the contested 2020 election, but he never expected problems in his own neighborhood. “It’s shocking,” he said, “that something like this would happen here.”

Exclusive: Biden administration buys last oil for emergency reserve as fund taps out,"WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The Biden administration said on Friday it has bought its last batch of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after selling a record amount from the facility in 2022 to counter fuel prices that had risen after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The Department of Energy said it had bought 2.4 million barrels of oil for the reserve for delivery from April through May to the SPR's Bryan Mound, Texas site.
The Reuters Power Up newsletter provides everything you need to know about the global energy industry. Sign up here.
The U.S. and Ukraine have signed a deal to give the United States preferential access to new Ukrainian minerals deals and fund investment in Ukraine's reconstruction.




The purchase depleted the department's fund to buy back more oil for the reserve, it said. The 2022 sale of 180 million barrels of crude had raised nearly $17 billion in emergency revenue for buybacks, but Congress had rescinded about $2.05 billion to help offset the national deficit.
The Biden administration has bought back 59 million barrels after the 2022 sale at an average price of less than $76 a barrel, far lower than the $95 a barrel it sold oil in 2022. That resulted in a profit of about $3.5 billion, the DOE said.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said the effort cements the administration's ""commitment of putting the economic and energy security of the American people first with actions that steadied prices at the pump, provided certainty to industry, and maintained the SPR as the world’s largest supply of emergency crude oil.”
The Biden administration also worked with Congress to cancel congressionally-mandated sales of 140 million barrels of SPR oil through 2027 that both Democratic and Republican lawmakers had voted for.

President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, will have to work with Congress to replenish the department's purchasing fund. Trump has said he would put oil into the SPR.
The 2022 sale of 180 million barrels over six months was the biggest sale ever from the SPR. It helped to counter U.S. gasoline prices that spiked to record prices of more than $5 a gallon in June, 2022.
It also sank SPR levels to the lowest in 40 years of under 350 million barrels, sparking criticism from some lawmakers who said it cut into the U.S. energy security buffer. The SPR currently has nearly 390 million barrels. The most oil it ever held was nearly 727 million barrels in 2009.

The U.S., however, is now the world's largest oil and gas producer, thanks to techniques such as fracking and horizontal drilling. It is more energy secure than in the mid-1970s, when Washington created the SPR, the world's largest emergency oil stash, after supply shocks including the Arab oil embargo.

Trump has been critical of Biden's assistance for Ukraine, fueling concern about the future of support for President Volodomyr Zelenskiy's government under a Republican-controlled White House, Senate and possibly the House of Representatives.
The House has been narrowly controlled by Republicans since January 2023, and it was not clear by Wednesday afternoon whether the party had won enough seats in Tuesday's elections to keep Democrats from winning a slim majority.

The Republican-controlled House last approved aid for Ukraine, including the authority for Biden to transfer billions of dollars in weapons from U.S. stocks, in April -- eight months after Biden first asked for additional aid, with the support of more Democrats than Republicans.
Of the weapons transfer authority passed in April, $4.3 billion remains, in addition to $2.8 billion worth of transfers lawmakers approved in previous spending measures and $2 billion in funding for the purchase of new weapons from industry.

Analysts say it is by no means certain Washington would back any more Ukraine assistance once Republicans control the White House and at least half of Congress, especially as Ukraine experiences battlefield setbacks.
""That's going to be a problem when you go forward with additional funding for Ukraine, which at some point is going to be necessary,"" said Scott Anderson, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell declined to discuss aid for Ukraine at a press conference on Wednesday, saying he was there only to discuss election results.
As he ran for a second four-year term, Trump insisted Russian President Vladimir Putin would never have invaded Ukraine in 2022 had he been in office, adding that he ""could solve that in 24 hours.""
Trump told Reuters last year that Kyiv might have to cede territory to reach a peace agreement, something Ukraine has rejected and Biden has never suggested.
The vice president-elect, U.S. Senator J.D. Vance, has been a vocal critic of Ukraine assistance, arguing that government funds would be better spent on domestic priorities.

Trump did it his way in White House run. How he proved his advisers wrong,"In the weeks after Vice President Kamala Harris’ rapid ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket, Donald Trump’s allies and advisers urged him to stay on message.
Polls showed Americans trusted the former Republican president more on the economy and immigration than Harris. All he needed to do, they reasoned, was stick to those issues.
He didn’t.

Kamala Harris made a historic dash for the White House. Here’s why she fell short.

In the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump did it his way: diverging from prepared remarks, resorting to personal attacks, spouting anti-immigrant rhetoric, threatening retribution against rivals and ignoring advice from allies to stay focused on the issues.
As Trump sealed the election on Wednesday, winning 294 electoral votes to Harris’ 223 with several states still counting, the result wasn't just a win for him. It was also a triumph for the chaotic, scorched-Earth politics of Trumpism.

There were fewer leaks, less infighting and a more deliberate strategy honed by seasoned professionals this time than in Trump’s prior two campaigns, to be sure. Yet his third White House bid ultimately drew its force from the candidate himself. In the final weeks, that included meandering, apocalyptic speeches, race-baiting attacks on Harris and strongman language at odds with America’s political institutions.
Reuters spoke to more than 20 Trump allies, advisers, donors and Republican operatives for a detailed account of how Trump managed to pull off a stunning comeback, becoming the first former president in more than a century to win a second term after leaving the White House.

The interviews reveal how he forged key alliances, including with tech billionaire Elon Musk, who spent at least $119 million on canvassing for Trump in the seven battleground states. He also resisted calls to fire senior campaign staffers, choosing to keep together a team that avoided the internal chaos of Trump’s previous bids. And he kept the spotlight on immigration, rather than abortion, where Democrats have an edge with voters.
Scott Bessent, a Trump donor and economic adviser, recalled meeting with Trump speechwriters in August to offer ideas for what the campaign was billing as a big economic speech in the battleground state of North Carolina. But when Trump got on stage, he essentially tore up the script, dropping some economic talking points, delving instead into the border and crime – and ripping into Harris in personal terms.

Bessent told Reuters he was initially caught off guard by Trump’s address. But the crowd seemed to lap it up. After hearing rave reviews from blue-collar workers later that day, Bessent said he realized the power of Trump’s political instincts.
“I have to do it my way,” Trump told reporters a day after the North Carolina event, dismissing suggestions to alter his approach.

Issues outside Trump‘s control gave him built-in advantages. Harris’ shortened campaign season narrowed the time she had to make her case to voters and launch attack ads on Trump. Musk’s ownership of Twitter – now called X – offered a powerful platform for misinformation to go viral, including falsehoods about migrant crime that resonated with many voters.
And crucially, Trump was able to capitalize on voters’ sour economic mood, which left them looking for a change in leadership.

What About Inflation?

Stubbornly high prices weighed on voters, an issue Trump successfully pinned on Democrats. The inflation rate dropped sharply this year, but the easing came too late for Harris. Prices during the first 35 months of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration increased 17.6%, nearly triple the 6.2% during the first 35 months of Trump’s 2017-2021 administration, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“The major factor in Trump’s victory is that many people remember the pre-pandemic Trump economy as better for them than the Biden-Harris economy,” said Republican pollster Whit Ayres.
A majority of voters said they trust Trump more to handle the economy, with 51% saying they did so compared to 47% for Harris, according to preliminary results from a national exit poll conducted by data provider Edison Research. And the voters who identified the economy as their primary concern voted overwhelmingly for Trump over Harris - 79% to 20%.
Trump’s hardline rhetoric on immigration and other issues, which many Americans see as unsettling, energized some of his supporters on a visceral level. Those Americans, especially white, working-class voters in economically struggling towns, once again saw Trump as an anti-establishment figure who understood their grievances.

CONFIDENT, THEN FURIOUS
Up until the summer, the Trump campaign was largely coasting.
Trump refused to debate his Republican rivals during primary elections, yet he still glided to victory as the party’s nominee. In May, when he became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, opinion polls barely moved, broadly showing him ahead of Biden in key battleground states.

On June 27, the Republican got a huge break when Biden performed disastrously in their first debate. Trump allies were suddenly talking about winning safe Democratic states such as Virginia and New Hampshire.
Then, on July 13, Trump was grazed in the ear by a would-be assassin’s bullet during a speech in Pennsylvania. His party rallied around him. Iconic photos – Trump’s face blood-stained, fist in the air – were hailed by supporters as a symbol of Trump’s strength, endurance and sacrifice. Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla, endorsed him later that same day.
The Republican National Convention a few days later had a triumphant air. Reuters spoke to several business executives and donors at the convention who hoped to land jobs in what they were sure would be a second Trump administration.

That week, Trump announced his running mate would be Senator JD Vance, author of best-selling 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” and a youthful advocate of isolationism, trade restrictions and strict abortion curbs. The pick brought few new voters into Trump’s corner, underscoring the ex-president’s confidence that he was bound for victory.
Just three days after the convention, however, Biden announced he was dropping his re-election bid. Harris quickly emerged as the alternative, raising $100 million in two days – about the amount Trump had spent during his entire campaign to date – and unifying the Democratic Party almost overnight.
The Trump campaign appeared caught off guard. His team did not put out a statement for hours after Biden dropped out. And while the main pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc, released an attack ad almost immediately, it took days before the campaign launched a major anti-Harris ad blitz.
“They were not prepared,” said one Republican operative close to the campaign, citing insufficient opposition research into Harris as an example.
While they were in the backroom mixing the paint, the Democrats were doing the painting.

Jason Cabel Roe, Republican strategist

Several aides and advisers said the campaign doubted Biden would drop out, after surviving pressure from fellow Democrats in the days after the debate. And if Biden did step aside, the Trump campaign expected a chaotic process to replace him, with a competitive convention or an abbreviated nominating contest possible, four aides and advisers said.
They were surprised by the speed of Harris' surge, aides said. Advisers spent valuable time, for instance, running advertisements through focus groups to gauge their effectiveness, according to one person with knowledge of campaign operations.
“While they were in the backroom mixing the paint, the Democrats were doing the painting,” said Jason Cabel Roe, a Republican strategist with contacts in the Trump campaign.
As Harris started to rise in the polls and fill arenas, Trump complained in private of wasting hundreds of millions of dollars to beat a man who was no longer in the race, according to two associates who spoke with him frequently. At one point, when Trump was handed polling figures showing Harris making gains, he cast the papers aside in disgust, according to one of the two Trump associates. When top advisers made suggestions to get his campaign back on track, Trump at times ignored or berated them, claiming they were unprepared for Harris’ rise, associates said.
A campaign official who declined to be identified denied Trump threw papers and that campaign money was wasted. “The results speak for themselves,” the official said..
YOU’RE NOT FIRED
Over the summer, Trump and his allies grilled campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita about what went wrong, according to three sources close to the campaign.
A former Marine wounded in the 1991 Gulf War, LaCivita, 58, was a veteran of Republican campaigns at the federal and state levels. Wiles, 67, was a longtime Florida political consultant who worked on former president Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign.
Up to that point, Wiles and LaCivita had won praise from Republican insiders for running a more disciplined operation than Trump’s past campaigns. Now, however, some of Trump’s allies questioned why the pair agreed to an early debate that upended a race they were on course to win.

Trump responded by hiring Corey Lewandowski, a longtime adviser who was fired during the 2016 campaign after clashing with other staff. Author of a book titled “Let Trump Be Trump,” Lewandowski was known for supporting some of the ex-president’s most controversial instincts, including his tendency to lean into conspiracy theories.
Lewandowski’s mid-August arrival fueled a sense of paranoia in the campaign, operatives said. He began reviewing campaign expenses, according to three sources briefed on Lewandowski’s activities. He briefed Trump separately from the rest of the leadership team and advised Trump to shake up his top campaign brass, one of the operatives said.
Trump’s previous two campaigns had been plagued by infighting and shake-ups. Some aides fretted that Lewandowski’s arrival would bring similar upheaval. But this time, Trump did not fire the team. “He handled it in a more executive way than he usually would,” said the operative close to the campaign. “Firing people would have been disruptive and would have caused a lot of ink. So he didn’t.”
Lewandowski and Wiles didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
“DUMB AS A FOX”
As Harris retained a small lead in some polls in September, Trump leaned into dark rhetoric about migrants. Some donors and advisers said at the time they feared the tactic would destroy his campaign by alienating independent voters. Yet the rhetoric kept the spotlight on immigration, an issue that favored Trump more than Harris, according to opinion polls.
At his Sept. 10 debate with Harris, their only face-to-face showdown, Trump repeated false claims that Venezuelan gangs had taken over swathes of a Colorado town. And he championed a false rumor that Haitians in Ohio were stealing and devouring their neighbors’ pets. “They’re eating the dogs!” Trump shouted. “They’re eating the cats!”
As those lines went viral, donors urged the campaign to focus on other issues.
But Trump doubled down.

After the debate, the screens at his rallies featured big slides flashing what appeared to be computer-generated images of Venezuelans in Colorado apartment buildings. “Migrant crime” became a hallmark of Trump’s campaign, though academic studies show immigrants do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans. Trump frequently put the spotlight on young white women allegedly killed by migrants illegally in the country.
The extreme rhetoric, though divisive, diverted attention from issues where Trump was vulnerable, such as abortion or the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. While immigration has long been a hot-button social issue in the U.S., Trump spun it as an urgent existential threat, based largely on unfounded conspiracy theories. As voters responded – some with support, others with sharp criticism – Trump succeeded in injecting immigration deeper into the race.
As his polling numbers started to improve in October, some advisors and donors praised Trump: They now believed he had shifted the focus in his favor.
“I do think as clumsy and as weird as the animal-eating conversation has been, it did put a big magnifying glass on what is happening in some communities in the country that are being overwhelmed,” said Roe, the Republican strategist.
One advisor put it more bluntly. On immigration, he quipped, Trump was “as dumb as a fox,” referring to the animal known for its cunning.
NEW ALLIES: MUSK AND RFK JR
As Trump’s polling numbers stabilized in October, supporters worked in the background to broker alliances that helped him consolidate support in the battleground states, especially among young men who don’t regularly vote.
Trump donor and financier Omeed Malik helped secure former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s endorsement after Kennedy dropped out of the race in August. Malik, a former Democrat, is part of a group of rich tech investors who have shifted right and embraced Trump in recent years. The Kennedy endorsement, Malik told Reuters, “helped build an alliance we haven’t seen in modern American politics.”
But no single figure did as much to boost Trump’s campaign as Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the world’s richest man. Over the summer, a Musk-founded super PAC, an outside spending group that can raise unlimited sums, emerged to help Trump turn out voters.

As Harris held on to a small lead in some polls, some Trump donors and Republican political operatives had raised doubts not just about Trump’s rhetoric, but also about the structure of his campaign. A common complaint centered on Trump’s “ground game,” the network of volunteers and employees who go door-to-door advocating for a candidate.
Trump had opted for a lean ground game that targeted a specific universe: infrequent voters inclined to support Trump. Senior Trump campaign staff had publicly described previous Republican door-knocking operations as bloated and expensive. In past elections, they said, Republicans wasted resources visiting people whose minds were already made up.
As the race tightened, Trump allies grew concerned that a weak swing-state operation could cost them the election, they said. One prominent Trump ally, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, warned Trump over the summer that his ground game appeared almost non-existent in her state of Georgia, said a person close to both politicians.
A representative for Greene did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Musk poured at least $119 million into a Trump door-knocking operation, according to filings to the Federal Election Commission.
While Musk’s America PAC struggled to reach some of its door-knocking goals and faced fraud claims, the massive operation still helped Trump’s otherwise paltry ground efforts. Like much of the campaign, Musk’s operation was geared at motivating soft Trump supporters to head to the polls – not at persuading undecided voters.
Musk’s ownership of X also helped. The billionaire regularly dashed off posts supporting Trump and spread misinformation about voting to his more than 203 million followers. Musk and Trump also spoke regularly, according to a source with knowledge of the conversations. Trump publicly promised to tap Musk to lead a government efficiency commission if elected.
By October, Musk had set up camp in must-win Pennsylvania and was giving away $1 million each day to a voter who signed a conservative political petition. Only those registered to vote in one of the seven swing states would be eligible to sign the petition.
Musk did not respond to an email requesting comment.
THE ENDGAME
By the end of the campaign, Trump’s rhetoric was turning angrier and more apocalyptic. He frequently warned of a global nuclear war should he lose. In the final weeks, he appeared to gain momentum in polls. With the race looking like a coin toss, he showed little restraint. He repeatedly warned of the “enemy from within” when referring to political opponents, words that Democrats denounced as dangerous and reminiscent of fascist rhetoric.
His speeches went off on increasingly odd tangents. In Pennsylvania in late October, Trump discussed the purported size of the late golfer Arnold Palmer’s penis. In a discussion with podcaster celebrity Joe Rogan a few days later, he mused about life on Mars and said he would like to be a “whale psychiatrist” when talking about wind energy.
Trump’s aides said he set the pace of his events and talked as long as he wanted, often in an unscripted style he called “the weave” – a meandering approach that he claimed always returned to his initial point.
At a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York 9 days before Election Day, a pro-Trump comedian called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” – a statement that sparked an instant backlash and risked turning off the key Puerto Rican vote in crucial battleground states. The event was supposed to showcase Trump’s broad-based coalition. Instead, opponents branded it a symbol of the bigotry voiced by some of his supporters.

Two days later, a week before Election Day, Trump got a break – and ran with it. Responding to the comedian’s insult, Biden seemingly referred to Trump supporters as “garbage.” Trump’s showman instincts kicked in. Looking to draw attention to the gaffe, he donned an orange safety vest and climbed into a garbage truck before a sea of cameras in Wisconsin. The moment went viral on social media, possibly distracting some voters from his vulnerable issues.
Beyond these erratic flourishes in the final days, however, Trump regularly made a point of asking supporters whether they were better off during his presidency or the current Biden-Harris administration.
In the end, a critical mass of American voters fell into one of two camps. They either positively embraced Trump’s dark vision, or they were willing to overlook it.
“If you were going to be turned off by Trump’s rhetoric, you’d already be a Harris supporter,” said Republican consultant Jon Fleischman. It was the economy, Fleischman argued, that in the final hours led undecided voters to break for Trump.
“Voters looked back and asked the question: Am I better off now than I was four years ago? And I think most swing voters said: ‘No.’”

Another tough winter looms as Russian forces have been advancing at the fastest rate since Ukraine first repulsed their invasion at the outskirts of Kyiv in early 2022. Ukraine, for its part, has launched its first major incursion into Russian territory.
Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the war.
Moscow's forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognised. Kyiv demands all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by Western allies under the outgoing U.S. administration of Joe Biden.

PEACE WITH 'CERTAIN CONCESSIONS'
Ukrainian political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said Trump would likely push for swift talks to end the war, which could involve ""certain concessions"" to Russia. But he said he expected Washington would be unlikely to capitulate to Moscow's demands.
""I don't think that Trump would agree to peace only on Russia's terms, as this would look like a defeat for the U.S., and his advisers understand this,"" he said.

Ukraine's international sovereign bonds rallied nearly 2 cents in early European trading on Wednesday, with investors saying the market was anticipating a quicker end to the war now that Trump had won.
As Ukraine's top military backer, the U.S. has sent tens of billions of dollars in arms, and led international efforts to isolate Moscow diplomatically and through financial sanctions.
But Ukraine has also expressed frustration at delays in approving missiles, tanks, planes and other weapons by the Biden administration, whose fear of escalation led to a piecemeal approach that critics say gave Moscow time to recover from early failures.
Most recently, Ukraine has called on the West to lift restrictions on using missiles to attack deep into Russia, which Kyiv says is necessary to disrupt long-range Russian attacks.
Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a lawmaker from the opposition Holos party, said on Telegram that the transition until Trump takes office in January could be ""a window of opportunity"" for Biden to take ""bold steps"".
Lawmaker Oleksandra Ustinova, who heads the parliamentary commission on arms and munitions, said Trump's picks for the top diplomatic, security and defence jobs would be key in determining the Trump administration's impact on the war.
""These are the people who will decide the fate of Ukraine,"" Ustinova told Reuters. ""Right now, it is highly likely that Mike Pompeo will be the defence secretary, and he is a great friend of Ukraine.""
""Of course, everyone is worried when any change happens. On the other hand, we understand that this was an expected outcome and we have always worked with both parties,"" she added.
Residents of Kyiv, which comes under regular drone and missile attack from Russian forces and faces a winter of power shortages, were eager to hear how Trump would stop the war.
""I guess we are all waiting for just the only thing — just to stop the war, and as Trump promised to stop the war in just one day, we are all waiting for it,"" said Oleksii Iarokha, 41.
""It could be today, tomorrow, we can wait till Friday. You are the president, please do it, Mr Trump.""
Others pondered how Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom the Republican has avoided sharply criticising, might affect new U.S. policy on Ukraine.
""On the one hand, one might think that he would somehow influence"" Putin, said Iryna Dvirna, 21. ""On the other hand, they say that they have very close ties, and perhaps Trump will not put so much pressure on Putin to change anything.""

She worked with the Trump administration as the CEO of the World Bank in 2018 to land a $13 billion capital increase, and later, as head of the IMF, to channel rapid COVID-19 relief financing to struggling economies across the world.
The U.S. Treasury at the time was complaining about excessive World Bank lending to China, and Georgieva said the Trump administration had demanded reforms to raise borrowing costs for larger middle-income countries to discourage such loans in exchange for backing the capital increase.

""So from that perspective, I think we can see the same very practical, pragmatic attitude in the future,"" from U.S. administrations, she added.

"With Trump win, Democrats ask anxious questions about America","MILWAUKEE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - In anxious conversations across the U.S. on Wednesday, many Democrats were struggling to understand what led their neighbors to vote Republican Donald Trump back into the White House.
Some feared that Tuesday's presidential election showed that their values – left-leaning, socially liberal – were now firmly a minority among Americans in a divisive campaign. Others were frustrated with the Democratic Party's leadership, who they said had lost touch with much of the electorate who wanted help with the rising cost of living.

With few exceptions, Democrats worried about the future for themselves, family and friends after Tuesday's results revealed the electorate's pronounced shift to the political right.

In a country of more than 330 million people, about 45 million voters were registered as Democrats, opens new tab as of March, compared to 35.7 million registered Republicans and 32.5 million independents. The Democratic Party has won the popular vote in every presidential contest since 2008.
But Trump was leading the popular vote by around 5 million votes late on Wednesday. Some of his largest advances were seen in and around big cities, areas that have been critical for past Democratic victories. He was up 14 percentage points with Hispanic voters compared to 2020, according to an Edison Research exit poll, and once more piled up support among Americans without college degrees.

Washkuhn is not convinced the party has figured out how to staunch its bleeding support: ""It feels like the Democrats are trying to play chess, but don't know how to move all the pieces anymore,"" he said.
Harris, who is Black and an Asian American, would have been the first woman to become the U.S. president had she won. Some Democrats saw sexism or racism in her defeat.
In Raleigh, North Carolina, Krista Wilson, a registered Democrat, said it was a ""hard day to be a woman"" following the victory of Trump, who was convicted on 34 criminal counts in a hush money case, impeached twice and found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in a civil trial.
""I'm afraid for the state of the country that people would vote for a convicted felon, someone who is unstable, who incited violence, and who uses fear and racism to motivate voters - that they would vote for him over a highly qualified woman,"" said Wilson, a 40-year-old infrastructure consultant.
Some Democrats saw less sinister motives.
""I think it was about people's pocketbooks,"" said Jean Thomson, a 63-year-old executive coach in Marietta, Georgia. Groceries and other expenses were cheaper under Trump, and many voters hoped, wrongly in Thomson's view, that Trump could bring prices down.
""His behavior is so egregious, but many of my Republican friends say you need to look past that,"" said Thomson.
Aaliyah Pilgrim, 28, who voted for Harris in Georgia, was devastated by Trump's win, but also said she was depressed by her belief that the Democratic Party has lost its way and does not see it ""ever recovering, ever.""
""Democrats are meant to be for the people, but people don’t see that,"" she said. She works in a care home and also drives for ride-share companies to help pay her bills. ""Things are getting harder for the lower-class people. We need more support and people think they will get that from the Republicans. I'm scared.""
A number of Democrats say they are dismayed by Biden and his party's support for Israel's deadly military campaigns in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon. Pro-Palestinian protesters frequently heckled Harris during her election campaign rallies, and warned she would lose votes in the battleground state of Michigan, home to the largest population of Arab Americans in the U.S., which Trump flipped on Tuesday.
Lexis Zeidan, a Palestinian American in Dearborn, Michigan, who co-founded the Uncommitted National Movement, said that Harris surely faced racism and sexism, but her party had also ignored the needs and anti-war values of many core voters.
""This administration completely ignored a lot of things that people cared about – climate justice, the working class,"" Zeidan said, ""talking about a great economy where people can barely afford groceries and rent, and, what I care most about, Gaza policy, and bombs being dropped.""
Zeidan, a Democrat who worked to get Biden elected in 2020, said she voted straight Democrat in all the races on her ballot in Tuesday's election except at the top, leaving the line for president blank.

US appeals court says counting ballots received after Election Day is illegal,"Oct 25 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday said it was illegal for states to count mail-in ballots received after Election Day, siding with Republicans in a case challenging Mississippi's five-day grace period.

The election will also decide control of Congress.
Republicans are generally skeptical of mail-in ballots, with Trump repeatedly claiming without evidence that they are sources of widespread fraud.

The Trump campaign did not respond directly to questions about plans to challenge the results. In a statement, Danielle Alvarez, a senior advisor for the campaign and the Republican National Committee, said the party had recruited 230,000 poll watchers, poll workers and legal experts to “bring transparency and accountability” to the election.
""While Democrats will stop at nothing to weaken our elections, we are fighting for a fair and secure process where every legal vote is counted properly,"" she said.

Throughout his campaign, Trump has repeated the falsehood that he won in 2020 while signaling he would contest a possible loss to Harris.
On Friday, in a post on Trump’s Truth Social platform, he wrote that there was ""rampant Cheating and Skulduggery"" in 2020 and threatened election officials and others “involved in unscrupulous behavior” this cycle with prosecution.
Election officials say one of their biggest fears is a razor-close result where the outcome will hinge on court fights over small numbers of disputed ballots. The Republican National Committee has targeted election officials with dozens of lawsuits challenging various aspects of the voting process, a move seen by Democrats as a prelude to contesting a potential loss. Republican poll watchers, who monitor the casting and counting of ballots, have been trained to be aggressive in scrutinizing the process, and their ranks are filled with activists who still deny the 2020 results, according to training calls reviewed by Reuters.
URBAN BATTLEGROUNDS
The tensions are especially acute in Philadelphia, Atlanta and Detroit, major Democratic vote centers in crucial swing states. Trump accused them of allowing electoral fraud in 2020 and has done so again since the start of this campaign.
At an Iowa rally in December , he urged followers to go to the three cities and ""guard the vote,"" a phrase that alarmed Democrats who warned it could prompt his supporters to intimidate voters or disrupt the counting.
Daniel Baxter, Detroit's chief operating officer for absentee voting and special projects, said the city is preparing for potential unrest in planning with local police and federal officials. Its election headquarters has been strengthened with armed guards and bullet-proof glass. The counting of mail-in ballots has been moved to a more secure location in the convention hall downtown. In 2020, Trump supporters sought to disrupt the process by pounding on windows and yelling ""stop the count.""
""We plan for a riot,"" Baxter said in an interview. “We just want to make sure that we have planned for the worst as we hope for the best.” He said he is unaffiliated with any party.
In a virtual meeting for prospective poll workers, an official with the Republican National Committee warned the volunteers that Detroit was not to be trusted. ""Because that city, if I could get away with ... you know, burning it to the ground, I would try,"" said Morgan Ray, the RNC's director of election integrity for Michigan, according to a previously unreported recording of the Sept. 10 meeting obtained by Reuters. Ray and the RNC didn’t respond to requests for comment on her remarks.
Trump also singled out Detroit, America’s largest Black-majority city, saying on Oct. 10 that the rest of the country would become “like Detroit” if Harris wins. Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey, a Democrat, said she believes racism was at the root of Trump’s attacks on cities like hers. ""He's the type of person that thinks that he can easily intimidate Detroiters because we're a predominantly Black city,” she said in an interview. “But we're not intimidated by him at all.""
The Trump campaign did not respond to a question about Winfrey’s remarks.

Philadelphia has overhauled vote-counting since delays in 2020 created an opening for Trump and his allies to spread conspiracy theories and for his supporters to target election officials with threats. In 2020, election clerks in Philadelphia and elsewhere struggled with an avalanche of mail-in ballots, thanks to more liberal vote-by-mail rules adopted by many states in response to the pandemic.
On election night in 2020, Trump declared himself the winner after early returns showed him in the lead, even though thousands of ballots remained to be processed in Philadelphia. With the election in the balance, it took the city five days to count enough ballots to make clear that Biden had indeed won Pennsylvania, clinching his bid for the White House.
Since then, the city has moved its election operations to a warehouse, secured by fencing topped with barbed wire, 15 miles from the downtown convention center where ballots were counted four years ago as protesters gathered outside. In Pennsylvania, unlike other states, state law bars election officials from beginning work on the mail ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day.
Michigan, by contrast, in 2022 passed a law allowing for pre-processing of mail-in ballots. Election workers in Detroit now have eight days to verify and tabulate absentee ballots prior to Election Day. City clerk Winfrey said she hopes to report results in time for the 11 p.m. TV news on Nov. 5.
Philadelphia officials say they also expect to deliver numbers much more quickly this year, with nearly all ballots counted by Wednesday or Thursday. The city expects to receive more than 225,000 mail ballots, far fewer than the 375,000 that flooded in four years ago. The city has purchased new, faster machines to slice open envelopes and scan ballots, along with new technology that officials say speeds up the process of checking mail ballots.
Philadelphia’s commissioners said they hope announcing the results faster will tamp down the spread of disinformation in the time between the polls closing and news organizations declaring a winner.
“That is the window that allows for the greatest misinformation and disinformation to spread and for harassment and threats to come to election workers,” said Seth Bluestein, a Republican on the city’s three-person election commission. “So that's why it's so important for us to shrink that window and count the ballots as quickly as possible.”
In Atlanta’s majority-Black Fulton County, Georgia’s most populous area, officials are preparing for pro-Trump misinformation. In 2020, Trump attorney Rudolph Giuliani falsely accused two Georgia election workers of counting illegal votes, triggering death threats against them and fueling Trump’s false claim that he won the state. The Georgia state election board, now dominated by three pro-Trump Republicans, has called for new investigations of Fulton County.
Opinion polls in the state show Harris and Trump roughly even. On Election Night, if Harris appears to be winning the state, Georgia State Election Board Member Sara Tindall Ghazal, a Democrat, said she expects “to see disinformation” about election machines being hacked and tampering with the vote.
Fulton’s election board chair, Sherri Allen, a registered Democrat serving on the non-partisan body, said the county has taken steps to reassure skeptics. It opened last year a new vote-counting operation in a massive suburban warehouse, 21 miles from downtown Atlanta. The vote count will be televised on giant screens, promoting transparency. “You can see it on the screen as it’s happening,” Allen said. “We didn’t have that before.”
“DIFFERENT WORLD NOW”
Beyond these urban battlegrounds, election officials in Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin and North Carolina are making preparations.
In North Carolina, some county election offices have installed panic buttons, bulletproof glass, security cameras and heavier doors, said State Board of Elections spokesperson Patrick Gannon. Election officials have been trained to defuse tensions with angry activists, he said. Police have been given pocket guides on election law in anticipation of increased challenges.
Nevada, where the 2020 election was not called until four days after the last ballots were cast, has changed laws and procedures to speed up counting and bolster confidence in the results. For the first time, mail-in ballots are being counted starting two weeks before Election Day. A new centralized statewide voter registration database allows citizens to track their ballots and make sure they accurately reflect their choices, which officials hope will quash concerns about mass fraud.
In Arizona, the secretary of state’s office said it has trained election officials to respond to AI-generated misinformation about the election, including deep-fake video and images.
And in Wisconsin, the state legislature passed an election protection bill this year that created a new crime of battery of an election official. Some municipalities pushed through ordinances aimed at people who might try to disrupt voting. Madison, for instance, now has an ordinance providing for $1,000 fines for people found threatening or otherwise hampering the work of poll workers.
Some changes are as subtle as moving chairs to bolster the safety of poll workers.
In the small northern Wisconsin town of Caswell, clerk Tamaney “Sam” Augustin has shifted poll workers across the room, so they faced, rather than sat next to, the door — with two exits directly behind them.
“We’ve never had anything happen,” she said, “but we live in a different world now.”

Biden will hold private meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and the heads of Japan, South Korea and Brazil during the summits of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, in Peru and the Group of 20 leading economies, or G20, in Brazil.

""The APEC and G20 will be about one thing ... and that is Donald Trump – and what to expect from the next Trump administration on trade, alliances, and other issues,"" said Victor Cha, president of the Geopolitics and Foreign Policy Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, in the Nov. 5 presidential election after promising Americans he would impose steep tariffs on all imports, with higher ones aimed at Chinese goods, and signaled much softer support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Harris' loss came after Biden was forced to step aside in the race because of concerns that at 81 he was too old for another term.

Trump's Republican party also won control of both houses of the U.S. Congress, giving him additional power to push through measures on trade and other issues.

Trump has a fundamentally different world view than Biden, preferring bilateral meetings where he can practice transactional diplomacy over multilateral partnerships like NATO.

Sullivan also said Biden would raise concerns with other leaders over the introduction of North Korean soldiers into Russia, calling it a significant development. He said he expected a ""coordinated set of policy decisions"" in response to the issue.

Biden will meet with President Xi on Saturday during the APEC summit in Lima, White House officials said. The one-on-one meeting will be Biden's final opportunity to challenge the Chinese leader directly on its threats against Taiwan, alleged human rights violations and support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
It will be the first time the two leaders have met in person since a summit between the pair in California a year ago. That marked a turning point for U.S.-China relations after Biden's decision in early 2023 to shoot down a Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States increased tensions.
U.S. economic and military competition with China will define what the world looks like over the next 30 years, Sullivan said, adding that Republicans and Democrats have long demonstrated bipartisanship in the area of foreign policy.

"Wall Street girds for Trump 2.0: Tariffs, tax cuts and volatility","Nov 6 (Reuters) - With Donald Trump heading back to the White House, Wall Street is anticipating the potential for lower taxes, deregulation and a U.S. president who is quick to sound off on everything from the stock market to the dollar.
Trump made tariffs and tax cuts key elements of his pitch to voters, many of whom said the economy was the biggest issue of the election. Another important plank of his platform is expected to be deregulation in areas ranging from the banking industry to cryptocurrencies.

The promise of those policies appears to have already stirred prices for some assets, including the dollar, shares of regional banks and the price of bitcoin.
For a Trump administration, ""markets are basically thinking it's pro-growth, even if it comes with higher inflation and higher interest rates,"" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS Group.
Edison Research projected on Wednesday that Trump had secured more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency.
While political developments can move markets, investors say they typically tend to take a back seat to macroeconomic forces and the health of corporate profits as well as global events.

For example, the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 70% during Trump's first term as technology shares soared, even as his tariff policies sparked bouts of volatility. Meanwhile, the energy sector notched deep losses after global economies were paralyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, although his administration was friendly to fossil fuel development.
HISTORY NOT A GUIDE?
Trump’s election in 2016 sparked a so-called reflation trade, with investors piling into an array of assets such as copper futures and shares of construction companies on the belief that tax cuts and other stimulative policies would boost sluggish U.S. economic growth.

But the economic landscape has changed, and some investors believe the moves of 2016 may not offer an accurate roadmap for how stocks, bonds and the dollar might trade in coming months.
The U.S. economy grew by an annualized rate of 2.8% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to just below 2% in 2016. And while months of restrictive monetary policy have helped tamp inflation down from four-decade highs hit in 2022, some investors worry tariffs or tax cuts could send consumer prices higher again. By contrast, sluggish inflation and growth were concerns for the Fed eight years ago.

Signs of rebounding inflation could also cause a rethink of the Federal Reserve's interest rate trajectory, with the central bank just beginning to ease monetary policy after hiking rates to bring inflation down from 40-year highs.

And while the last weeks of the 2024 presidential race saw betting markets move in favor of Trump over his opponent, Kamala Harris, his 2016 victory ""was a general surprise, the positive market reaction was a surprise too, and the investor positioning in the runup to elections was for a disinflationary backdrop,"" JPMorgan strategists wrote on Monday.
TARIFFS AND TAX REFORM
The potential implementation of tariffs - which Trump has vowed to increase by 10% on imports, and 60% on goods from China - could make a key difference in how investors approach asset markets in coming months.
A study by Deutsche Bank said a Trump victory would add about half a percentage point to U.S. gross domestic product if tariffs are not implemented. Tariffs would subtract about a quarter of a point from GDP, the study found.
""There are still going to be some question marks as to how aggressive Trump does go with tariffs, and that's going to be a story regardless of the composition of Congress, given that can be pushed through via executive action,"" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers.
Trump also wants tax reform, including reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, for those companies that make their products in the U.S., after having cut the rate to 21% from 35% during his 2017-2021 presidency.
Such tax cuts - which will need to pass Congress - could support company earnings and sentiment for stocks, although the extent of such a boost remains to be seen.
Cutting the rate to 15% would boost S&amp;P 500 earnings by about 4%, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs strategists.
""In the shorter term, equity investors will look upon favorably a Trump victory because the potential for him"" to extend current tax cuts, said Jake Seltz, portfolio manager with Allspring Global Investments.
At the same time, broad tax cuts could spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt when investors are becoming increasingly focused on the federal deficit. Deficit worries have helped spark a recent selloff in U.S. government debt, taking the 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to bond prices, to 4.471% on Wednesday, its highest level since July.
Trump's tax and spending plans would increase the debt by $7.75 trillion over the next decade, according to an Oct. 28 estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a budget-focused think-tank.
An added wrinkle is Trump's penchant to speak on a wide swath of potentially market-moving topics, demonstrated during his first term when he frequently commented on everything from the strength of the dollar to trade to the policies of individual companies. Those remarks occasionally sparked asset price moves.
""Markets are a little on edge about the idea that a Trump administration will come with a lot of communication that will be difficult to separate the noise from signal,"" said DWS Group's Bianco.

Trump re-election entrenches global instability,"WASHINGTON, Nov 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump’s victory over his political opponent Kamala Harris ushers in a perilous new era for the United States and the rest of the world. The former president promised a “golden age for America” after his third election campaign produced his most convincing victory. But any short-term gains for corporations and investors must be set against his authoritarian instincts and willingness to further question the U.S.-led international order. That puts an already fraying global balance at even further risk.




Over the coming four years, businesses can expect a cascade of tax breaks, regulatory rollbacks, and favorable court decisions. The chances of Congress, which now includes a Republican majority in the Senate, raising the corporate tax rate above 21% during next year are now virtually nil; Harris wanted to raise it to 28%.
Spending cuts to pay for other tax reductions are likely, as well, although control of the House of Representatives remained up for grabs early on Wednesday morning. Divided government would make it harder for Trump to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, after Republicans failed to do so during his first term. Wall Street will cheer new appointees for major banking and markets regulators who are sure to be friendlier than outgoing President Joe Biden’s. And the crypto industry will likely get its long-sought regulatory legitimacy, a force multiplier for its potential growth. The dollar, U.S. stock futures and bitcoin all rallied in anticipation of Trump’s victory.

A Biden-era law providing a decade of lucrative subsidies for new solar, wind and other clean-energy projects would be near-impossible to repeal, however, thanks to support from Republican states, while other levers available to the next president would only have marginal impact, analysts say.

Fleming said Trump could, however, slow things down around the margins by hindering federal agencies that deliver IRA grants and loans, or by reducing federal leasing for things such as offshore wind.
""You could see a new administration come in and they can very quickly begin to cut budgets or restrict budgets or restrict the freedom of agencies to do certain things that are tied to funding,"" he said.

""But I think that's a smaller subset of the larger renewables market that's really relying on those, so I don't think it would have a shocking effect.""
The Biden administration has rushed to ensure it spends the majority of available grant funding under the IRA before a new president arrives, Reuters has previously reported.
One way Trump could slow the transition is through executive action by changing public lands leasing, analysts said. The Biden administration had sought to expand lease auctions for offshore wind in federal waters, along with solar and wind on land.
""I think you would see more preference given to fossil-fuel extraction on public lands and waters,"" said Tony Dutzik, associate director and senior policy analyst at Frontier Group, a non-profit sustainability think-tank.
That could have an outsized impact on the offshore-wind industry, which aims to site projects in federal waters. Most onshore solar and wind projects are located on private property, as is the vast majority of oil and gas drilling.
Trump has said he intends to end the offshore-wind industry ""on day one,"" arguing it is too expensive and poses a threat to whales and seabirds, a dramatic policy reversal after his first administration supported offshore-wind development.
Bernstein Research said Trump is likely to enact a moratorium on new offshore-wind lease sales.
Meanwhile, U.S. fossil-fuel production is likely to look much the same under Trump, experts said. The U.S. has already become the world's largest oil and gas producer, under the watch of Biden, thanks to a drilling boom in fields such as the Permian Basin under Texas and New Mexico.
The production boom started under former President Barack Obama and has continued through the Trump and Biden presidencies. Even so, Trump's campaign has sought to claim credit, saying his efforts to slash regulatory red tape during his 2017-2021 term paved the way, and arguing he could further expand U.S. fossil-fuel production in a second term by rolling back Biden's climate initiatives.
""Presidents can make a lot of noise about plans for U.S. oil and gas, but ultimately it's individuals and companies responding to prices of a global commodity that make the decisions on when to drill,"" said Jesse Jones, head of North American upstream at Energy Aspects.
Dan Eberhart, Trump donor and CEO of oilfield-services company Canary, LLC, said he supports Trump's encouragement of increased oil-and-gas drilling, saying it could further lower energy prices for businesses and consumers.
He added he would also welcome a move by Trump to once again withdraw the United States from international climate cooperation, like he did in his first term, arguing other big greenhouse-gas emitters were not doing enough.
""The Paris accord was aspirational and meaningless if China and India don't participate,"" he said, referring to a landmark U.N. deal in 2015 to limit global warming.

MAXIMUM TRANSPARENCY PROMISED
Trump likened the efficiency effort to the Manhattan Project, the U.S. undertaking to build the atomic bomb that helped end World War Two, while Musk promised transparency.
""All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency,"" Musk said on X, inviting the public to provide tips.
""We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining,"" Musk said.
Musk said at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in October that the federal budget could be reduced by ""at least"" $2 trillion. Discretionary spending, including defense spending, is estimated to total $1.9 trillion out of $6.75 trillion in total federal outlays for fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
""Your money is being wasted and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that. We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook,"" Musk said at the rally.

Dogecoin has more than doubled since Election Day, tracking a surge in cryptocurrency markets on expectations of a softer regulatory ride under a Trump administration.
Shares in Tesla fell on Wall Street ahead of the announcement but are up about 30% since the election.
Ramaswamy is the founder of a pharmaceutical company who ran for the Republican presidential nomination against Trump and then threw his support behind the former president after dropping out.
In his 2021 bestseller ""Woke, Inc.,"" Ramaswamy decried decisions by some big companies to base business strategy around social justice and climate change concerns.
Ramaswamy said the appointment means he is withdrawing from consideration for the pending U.S. Senate appointment in Ohio, where Governor Mike DeWine will appoint a replacement for JD Vance, who will become Trump's vice president when they are inaugurated on Jan. 20.

Exclusive: Trump's transition team aims to kill Biden EV tax credit,"Nov 14 (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Ending the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling U.S. EV transition. And yet representatives of Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab - by far the nation's biggest EV maker - have told a Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Stay up to date with the latest news, trends and innovations that are driving the global automotive industry with the Reuters Auto File newsletter. Sign up here.
U.S. auto giant Ford says it's going to take a $1.5 billion hit from President Donald Trump's tariffs this year.




Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of Trump's biggest backers and the world's richest person, said in July that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales but would be ""devastating"" to its U.S. EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors (GM.N), opens new tab.
Shares of Tesla ended nearly 6% lower at $311.18, while shares of smaller EV rival Rivian (RIVN.O), opens new tab closed down 14% at $10.31. Lucid (LCID.O), opens new tab, another EV maker, tumbled 5% to $2.08.

Repealing the subsidy, a signature measure of Democratic President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and Republican North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said.
The group has met several times since Trump's Nov. 5 election victory, including at his Florida Mar-a-Lago club, where Musk has also spent considerable time since the election.

Representatives of Tesla and Ford did not respond to requests for comment. GM and Stellantis declined to comment.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged Congress in an Oct. 15 letter to retain the EV tax credits, calling them ""critical to cementing the U.S. as a global leader"" in future auto manufacturing.
U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Friday that cancelling the credits would make the U.S. less competitive.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
""It would be so counterproductive,"" she told reporters at the COP29 climate conference in Baku when asked about the Reuters report. ""You eliminate these credits, and what do you do? You end up ceding the territory to other countries, particularly China.""
The Trump transition team did not comment on the fate of the EV tax credit but said in a statement that the president-elect would deliver on ""promises he made on the campaign trail.""

Trump campaigned on ending Biden's ""EV mandate,"" without spelling out specific targeted policies. The energy-focused transition team has determined some of Biden's clean-energy policies will be tough to end because they are popular and already funneling money to Republican-dominated states, the sources said.
The team views the consumer EV credit as an easy target, believing that eliminating it would get broad consensus in a Republican-controlled Congress.
Trump could use the cost savings from killing the credit to help pay for the extension of trillions of dollars in tax cuts from his first term that are set to expire soon, the two sources said. Congressional Republicans plan to take up the broader tax bill as one of their first actions.
Energy transition team members expect the Republican Congress will deploy a legislative measure known as reconciliation to avoid relying on Democratic votes. Biden used the same tactic to pass the IRA.
Killing EV tax credits is strongly supported by Hamm, a long-time Trump supporter, along with the broader oil-and-gas industry.
Trump promised while campaigning to boost U.S. oil production, even as it has hit record highs, and to roll back Biden’s clean-energy initiatives, which also include subsidies for wind and solar power and the mass production of hydrogen.
Shares of South Korean battery makers tanked on Friday after the Reuters report. LG Energy Solution (373220.KS), opens new tab, a supplier for Tesla, General Motors and other automakers, fell as much as 10%, while Samsung SDI (006400.KS), opens new tab lost 9.6%
WHY TESLA COULD BENEFIT
Tesla has historically been the biggest beneficiary of consumer EV subsidies passed by Biden and previous administrations. It now may stand to gain from killing the incentive because that could hurt rising EV competitors more than Tesla.
Musk himself pointed out as much in a July earnings call, saying losing the subsidy under Trump would ""probably benefit Tesla"" in the long term.
Tesla sold just under half of all U.S. EVs in the third quarter, according to data from Cox Automotive. Other automakers with notable EV sales such as GM, Ford and Hyundai, individually trail far behind. But Tesla’s U.S. EV rivals collectively have steadily eroded its market share, which exceeded 80% in the first quarter of 2020.
Nicholas Mersch, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments, a Tesla investor, said Tesla can withstand a potential sales hit from losing subsidies because the automaker's “engineering and manufacturing prowess"" lowers its costs.
“Getting rid of the subsidy means that competitors can’t catch up and won’t be able to compete on a cost basis,"" Mersch said
Musk and Tesla also stand to gain hugely from Biden policies that Trump will likely leave in place or strengthen - like steep trade barriers blocking imports of Chinese EVs, including a 100% tariff.
Chinese EV makers led by Tesla rival BYD (002594.SZ), opens new tab, have rocketed past the rest of the industry, with the help of generous government subsidies. Electric vehicles and hybrids have accounted for more than half of all cars sold in recent months in China, the world’s largest auto market.
Tesla is a major player in China but, like all foreign automakers, has been recently losing market share to homegrown players that sell EVs for as little as $10,000.
Tesla ""can't beat Chinese EVs,"" Mersch said, but with Trump's help may be able to keep them out of the U.S. market.
Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican strategist who runs the EV Politics Project - an advocacy group seeking bipartisan EV support - described ending the subsidy as a ""Tesla first, everybody else second"" policy.
He described the move as ""really bad for American automakers"" trying to catch up to highly subsidized Chinese EV industry.
""The Trump administration is proving they have absolutely no interest in helping the U.S. auto industry survive the coming Chinese invasion,"" he said.
WHY DETROIT NEEDS EV SUBSIDIES
Automakers in the U.S. market have been bracing for automotive-policy changes under Trump. Some could provide greater flexibility to build more gas-powered SUVs and trucks that generate big profits for the Detroit Three - General Motors, Ford and Jeep parent Stellantis.
But other changes, like losing the EV tax credit, could cripple their nascent efforts to transition to electric vehicles.
Losing EV subsidies would make it tougher for Tesla's struggling rivals to achieve profitability on those vehicles. GM, Ford, Hyundai and others are still ramping up EV production and scrambling to cut manufacturing costs.
Ford, which expects to record a $5 billion loss on its EV and software operations this year, has previously relied on EV tax credits to boost demand from price-conscious consumers.
Yet even with the credits, demand for Ford's F-150 Lightning electric pickup has faltered, leading Ford to idle the truck's production through the year-end.
The United Auto Workers labor union, which represents workers at the Detroit Three - but not Tesla - has supported Biden’s pro-EV policies, including the $7,500 incentive. Last month, UAW president Shawn Fain slammed Trump’s threats to repeal the policies, saying “hundreds of thousands” of auto-industry jobs were at stake.
GM, which touts plans to boost EV production, previously said it had received $800 million in separate EV manufacturing credits this year - also enacted in Biden’s IRA legislation - and expected that figure to grow.
GM recently said it planned to slash its annual EV losses next year by between $2 billion and $4 billion, which would be more difficult without the tax credit.
In a push to further cut costs around EVs, GM and Hyundai in September announced a non-binding memorandum of understanding to work together.

TRUMP SAYS NEW YORK RALLY 'AN ABSOLUTE LOVEFEST'
In Florida earlier in the day, Trump sought to move on from the racist and other vulgar remarks made by allies at his New York rally on Sunday.
Trump did not comment on the remarks made by speakers at the Sunday event where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage"" and disparaged Black Americans, Jewish people, Palestinians and Latinos.
Trump's campaign had said previously that the comments about Puerto Rico did not reflect the former president's views, but Trump on Tuesday called the New York event ""an absolute lovefest"" and said he was honored to be involved.
President Joe Biden drew ire from Trump's campaign for remarks he made about the Sunday rally during a fundraising call on Tuesday.
According to a transcript posted by a White House spokesperson on X, Biden said: ""the only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's - his - his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it's un-American.""
Several news organizations cited the same quote but without the apostrophe.
Biden later posted on X, the social media site: ""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.""

With Sinwar, whom U.S. officials say was the main stumbling block to talks, out of the way, Washington will ""redouble"" efforts to push forward a ceasefire proposal, the State Department said.
But Netanyahu, who at times also has been accused of stalling on a deal, on Thursday said the war would go on. A statement from his office, after he spoke to Biden, said the two leaders agreed that Sinwar's death has created an opportunity to push for the release of hostages in Gaza and that they would work together to achieve that goal.

A White House readout of the call said they ""discussed how to use this moment to bring the hostages home and to bring the war to a close with Israel’s security assured and Hamas never again able to control Gaza.""

Speaking on the sidelines of campaign events for her 2024 presidential campaign in Milwaukee, Harris reinforced the point.
""This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,"" Harris said.
'CHIEF OBSTACLE'
It was not immediately clear how Washington intended to restart efforts to secure the release of hostages and obtain a ceasefire.
In recent weeks, the Biden administration has publicly blamed Sinwar for stalling talks but has privately also doubted Netanyahu's willingness to do a deal.
The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has been a political liability for the Biden administration ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. elections. Harris faces intense pressure from Arab American, Muslim and liberal voters over the Biden administration's weapons aid and diplomatic support for Israel amid conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.
The Hamas attack last year killed 1,200 people in Israel and ended with the capture of more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel's assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed more than 42,000 people, the local health ministry has said, while displacing nearly its entire population and causing a hunger crisis. In Lebanon, where Israel said it is targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah militants, the death toll is over 2,000, according to the Lebanese government.
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would now ""redouble"" its efforts and try to push forward a proposal ""that has been on the table for some time.""
Secretary of State Blinken has already spoken to the foreign ministers of Qatar and Saudi Arabia about bringing an end to the war and post-war arrangements for Gaza, Miller said.
""We see an opportunity now that we want to seize to try to secure the release of the hostages,"" said Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan. ""We will have to work to ensure that his death actually does deal the kind of long-term blow to Hamas that all of us would like to see.""

Moldova's pro-Western Sandu claims election win after meddling allegations,"CHISINAU, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Moldova's pro-Western incumbent Maia Sandu claimed victory at Sunday's closely-fought presidential election, defeating Alexandr Stoianoglo, her rival backed by the traditionally pro-Russian Socialist Party.
With 98% of the ballots counted, Sandu led Stoianoglo with 54.35%, the Central Election Commission said at the end of an election and campaign that were marred by persistent allegations of interference denied by Russia.

The victory for the 52-year-old ex-World Bank adviser, who has accelerated the nation's push to leave Moscow's orbit and join the European Union, is seen by her supporters as an endorsement of the resolutely pro-Western course she has tacked.
But Stoianoglo's dominance across swathes of the country suggests her party faces a stiff challenge at key parliamentary elections next summer that will decide the composition of the government.

Stoianoglo campaigned saying he supported EU integration, but that he also wanted to develop ties with Russia in the national interest. Sandu portrayed him as a Trojan horse for the Kremlin's interests, something he denied.
The future of Moldova, a poor agricultural nation that has alternated between pro-Russian and pro-Western courses since the 1991 Soviet breakup, has been in the spotlight since Russia began its full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in 2022.

The vote was closely watched in Brussels a week after Georgia, another ex-Soviet state seeking membership, re-elected a ruling party regarded in the West as increasingly pro-Russian.
""Moldova, you are victorious! ... In our choice for a dignified future, no one lost,"" Sandu said in a conciliatory victory speech, in which she said she had to address the concerns of those who voted against her.
""I have heard your voice – both those who supported me and those who voted for Mr. Stoianoglo. I commit to being the president for all of you,"" she said.

The vote marked the largest number of expatriate voters to take part in a Moldovan election since 2010 when the diaspora was first allowed to vote.
Inside Moldova's borders, the results showed Sandu actually lost the election to Stoianoglo by a small margin of 48.8% versus his 51.2%. By contrast, she looked on course to win more than 80% of the diaspora vote, which was still being counted.
""The increased turnout in the diaspora paid off. It changed the balance of power,"" said Ruslan Rokhov, a Ukrainian political analyst focused on Moldova.

ELECTION MEDDLING CLAIMS
Sandu's national security adviser Stanislav Secrieru accused Russia on Sunday of massive interference, the latest in a series of allegations also levelled at fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor who lives in Russia and denies wrongdoing.
""We're seeing massive interference by Russia in our electoral process ... an effort with high potential to distort the outcome,"" Secrieru wrote on X on Sunday.
There was no immediate comment from Moscow, which has repeatedly denied allegations of meddling.
Secrieru cited reports of voters being taken to polling stations, cyberattacks and bomb hoaxes reported at overseas polling stations in Europe.
The police cracked down to try to avoid a repeat of what they said was a vast vote-buying scheme deployed by Shor in the first round and a referendum on the EU's aspirations that was held the same day.
Sandu has said the meddling affected the Oct. 20 first round and that Shor sought to buy the votes of 300,000 people, more than 10% of the population. The referendum delivered a slender win of 50.35% for the pro-EU camp.
Stoianoglo's East-West balancing rhetoric contrasted with Sandu's four years in power, during which ties with the Kremlin have unravelled, Moscow's diplomats have been expelled and she has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow calls her government ""Russophobic"".
Sandu painted Sunday's vote as a choice between a bright future in the EU by 2030 or one of uncertainty and instability.
Stoianoglo said that was untrue and that Sandu had failed to look out for the interests of ordinary Moldovans. He accused her of divisive politics in a country that has a Romanian-speaking majority and large Russian-speaking minority.
Stoianoglo benefited from protest votes against Sandu's handling of the economy.
Moldova struggled with the aftermath of the COVID pandemic and the effects of Russia's Ukraine invasion, which sparked a huge influx of refugees and sharply reduced Russian gas supplies, causing high inflation.
""I want you to know – I have heard all voices, including the critical ones. And I thank you for looking past grievances, past dissatisfactions, to protect our country,"" she said.

Trump campaign accuses UK's Labour Party of election interference,"LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's campaign has accused British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party of ""blatant foreign interference"" in the U.S. presidential election after some volunteers travelled to help campaign for Vice PresidentKamala Harris.
The Republican candidate's camp has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in Washington, calling for an investigation into what it termed apparently illegal contributions from Labour to the Harris campaign.

British political activists have long travelled to the U.S. ahead of elections, with those from the centre-left Labour Party typically supporting the Democrats, its sister party, and Conservatives and the right-wing Reform backing the Republicans.
Labour leader Starmer denied that the complaint would damage relations with Trump if the former president wins again on Nov. 5, saying Labour supporters were volunteering in their own time.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
But the complaint is a potential complication as Trump is already close to Britain's right-wing politician Nigel Farage and former prime minister Boris Johnson, both of whom are critical of Starmer.
The British prime minister met Trump at Trump Tower in September in a bid to build a relationship ahead of the vote.
""I write on behalf of Donald J. Trump for President 2024, Inc. to request an immediate investigation into blatant foreign interference in the 2024 Presidential Election in the form of apparent illegal foreign national contributions,"" the complaint said.

British officials, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that some senior Labour advisers travelled to meet Democrat strategists in recent months, on the back of their landslide victory in the British election in July.
One topic they discussed was how Labour won back almost all the former industrialised areas that abandoned them in 2019.
Reform leader Farage, the right-wing politician who was instrumental in Britain's vote to leave the European Union, has also campaigned in the U.S. for Trump this year. Former British prime minister, Liz Truss, from the Conservative Party, also attended the Republican convention and denounced President Joe Biden as weak.

According to U.S. rules, foreigners can volunteer on election campaigns but cannot make financial contributions, and the allegations of interference will hinge on whether Labour covered any activists' costs.
The FEC previously fined the campaign of Bernie Sanders after Australia's Labour Party funded the flights and food of its volunteers to travel to the U.S. and support his campaign.
The Trump complaint cited media reports and a now deleted LinkedIn post from Sofia Patel, head of operations at Britain's Labour Party, who wrote that nearly 100 current and former Labour party staff would be travelling to the U.S. in the coming weeks to help elect Harris, a Democrat.
Patel's post had said she had 10 spots to fill in North Carolina, adding ""we will sort your housing"".
Labour said in a statement that any party members taking part would be doing so at their own expense. Volunteers were put up by other local supporters. Starmer said they were there in their spare time.
British political activists have a history of trying to be involved in U.S. politics.
A 2004 effort by the left-leaning Guardian newspaper to get Britons to write to American voters in Clark County, to urge them to vote against George Bush, appeared to backfire when it recorded a swing towards Bush.
Greg Swenson, the chairman of Republican Overseas UK, said while campaigners had always travelled from Britain to support the two main parties, he said Labour had drawn attention by talking about it so publicly.
""The issue here is it looks organised,"" he told Reuters. ""It is really amazing that they have been so blatant about it.""
Trump has also long engaged in rhetorical reversals, accusing his political rivals of engaging in the sort of behaviour that he has been criticised for.
He regularly describes Harris' replacement of President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket as a ""coup,"" mirroring the way some critics described his supporters' Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol.
And in 2019 he called into a British radio show held by Farage ahead of an election, praising the then prime minister Johnson and criticising his rival, drawing accusations of electoral interference.

Harris tops Trump in Iowa in latest Des Moines Register poll,"WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has surpassed Republican Donald Trump in a new poll in Iowa, with likely women voters responsible for the turnaround in a state that Trump easily won in 2016 and 2020, according to a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released on Saturday.
The poll of 808 likely voters, who were surveyed Oct. 28-31, has Harris leading Trump 47%-44% in Iowa, which has been trending deeply Republican in recent years. It is within the 3.4 percentage point margin of error, but it marked a turnaround from a September Iowa Poll that had Trump with a 4-point lead, the newspaper reported.

"Who has Trump picked for top jobs in his new administration, and who's in the running for one?","Nov 11 (Reuters) - Donald Trump has begun the process of choosing a cabinet and selecting other high-ranking administration officials following his presidential election victory.
Here are the early picks and top contenders for some of the key posts overseeing defense, intelligence, diplomacy, trade, immigration and economic policymaking. Some are in contention for a range of posts.

SUSIE WILES, chief of staff
Trump on Thursday announced that Wiles, one of his two campaign managers, will be his White House chief of staff.




While the specifics of her political views are somewhat unclear, Wiles, 67, is credited with running a successful and efficient campaign. Supporters hope she will instill a sense of order and discipline that was often lacking during Trump's first four-year term, when he cycled through a number of chiefs of staff.
TOM HOMAN, 'border czar'
Trump announced on Sunday night that Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement from his first administration, will be in charge of the country's borders.

Trump made cracking down on people in the country illegally a central element of his campaign, promising mass deportations.
Homan said on Monday he would prioritize deporting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who posed safety and security threats as well as those working at job sites.
Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said Homan will be ""in charge of our nation's borders (""The Border Czar""), including, but not limited to, the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,"" including the deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

ELISE STEFANIK, U.N. ambassador
Trump announced on Monday that Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman and staunch Trump supporter, would be his ambassador to the United Nations.
Stefanik, 40, a U.S. representative from New York state and House Republican conference chair, took a leadership position in the House of Representatives in 2021 when she was elected to replace then-Representative Liz Cheney, who was ousted for criticizing Trump's false claims of election fraud.

""I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter.""
Stefanik will arrive at the U.N. after bold promises by Trump to end the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel's war in Gaza.
LEE ZELDIN, EPA administrator
Trump announced on Monday he had appointed former congressman Lee Zeldin of New York state as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Zeldin said he had accepted the role.

Zeldin, 44, a staunch Trump ally, served in Congress from 2015 to 2023. In 2022 he lost the New York governor's race to Democratic incumbent Kathy Hochul.
Trump has promised to overhaul U.S. energy policy, with the aim of maximizing the country's already record-high oil and gas production by rolling back regulations and speeding up permitting.
As head of the EPA, Zeldin will play a key role in implementing those policies.
SCOTT BESSENT, potential treasury secretary
Bessent, a key economic adviser to Trump, is widely seen as a top candidate for treasury secretary. A longtime hedge fund investor who taught at Yale University for several years, Bessent has a warm relationship with the president-elect.
While Bessent has long favored the laissez-faire policies that were popular in the pre-Trump Republican Party, he has also spoken highly of Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool. He has praised the president-elect's economic philosophy, which rests on a skepticism of both regulations and international trade.
JOHN PAULSON, potential treasury secretary
Paulson, a billionaire hedge fund manager and major Trump donor, is another top contender for treasury secretary. The longtime financier has told associates he would be interested in the job.
A longtime proponent of tax cuts and deregulation, Paulson's profile is broadly similar to that of other potential members of Trump's economic team. He has publicly supported targeted tariffs as a tool to ensure U.S. national security and combat unfair trade practices abroad.
One high-profile fundraiser hosted by Paulson in April raked in over $50 million for the former president.
LARRY KUDLOW, potential treasury secretary
Fox Business Network personality Larry Kudlow, who served as director of the National Economic Council for much of Trump's first term, has an outside shot at becoming his treasury secretary and would likely have an opportunity to take a separate economics-focused position if he is interested.
While he is privately skeptical of broad tariffs, there is publicly little daylight between the policies Kudlow advocates and those of the president-elect.
ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, potential treasury secretary
A loyalist who served as Trump's U.S. trade representative for essentially the then-president's entire term, Lighthizer will almost certainly be invited back. Though Bessent and Paulson likely have a better shot at becoming treasury secretary, Lighthizer has an outside chance, and he might be able to reprise his old role if he's interested.
Like Trump, Lighthizer is a trade skeptic and a firm believer in tariffs. He was one of the leading figures in Trump's trade war with China and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, with Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term.
HOWARD LUTNICK, potential treasury secretary
The co-chair of Trump's transition effort and the longtime chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick is in the running for treasury secretary.
A bombastic New Yorker like Trump, Lutnick has uniformly praised the president-elect's economic policies, including his use of tariffs.
He has at times given elaborate, unvarnished opinions about what policies will be enacted in Trump's second term. Some Trump allies had privately complained that he too often presented himself as speaking on behalf of the campaign.
LINDA McMAHON, potential commerce secretary
Professional wrestling magnate and former Small Business Administration director Linda McMahon is seen as the frontrunner to lead Trump's Department of Commerce, three sources briefed on the plans said.
McMahon is a major donor and was an early supporter of the Republican president-elect when he first ran for the White House almost a decade ago. This time, Trump tapped her to co-lead a transition team formed to help vet personnel and draft policy ahead of the Nov. 5 election.
McMahon is the co-founder and former CEO of the professional wrestling franchise WWE. She later served as director of the Small Business Administration, resigning in 2019, and went on to lead a pro-Trump political action committee that supported his 2020 reelection bid.
RICHARD GRENELL, potential secretary of state
Grenell is among Trump's closest foreign policy advisers. During the president-elect's first four-year term, he served as acting director of national intelligence and U.S. ambassador to Germany. When Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in September, Grenell sat in on the private meeting.
Grenell's private dealings with foreign leaders and often-caustic personality have made him the center of multiple controversies, though significant Republican gains in the Senate mean he could likely be confirmed. He is also considered a top contender for national security adviser, which does not require Senate confirmation.
Among the policies he has advocated for is setting up an autonomous zone in eastern Ukraine to end the war there, a position Kyiv considers unacceptable.
ROBERT O'BRIEN, potential secretary of state
O'Brien, Trump's fourth and final national security adviser during his first term, maintains a close relationship with Trump, and the two often speak on national security matters.
He is likely in the running for secretary of state or other top foreign policy and national security posts. He has maintained close contacts with foreign leaders since Trump left office, having met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel in May.
His views are somewhat more hawkish than some of Trump's advisers. He has, for instance, been more supportive of military aid for Ukraine than many of his Republican contemporaries, and he is a proponent of banning TikTok in the United States.
BILL HAGERTY, potential secretary of state
A U.S. senator from Tennessee who worked on Trump's 2016 transition effort, Hagerty is considered a top contender for secretary of state. He has maintained solid relations with essentially all factions of the Republican Party, and could likely be confirmed with ease in the Senate.
He served as U.S. ambassador to Japan in the first Trump administration at a time when the president touted his warm relationship with then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Hagerty's policies are broadly in line with Trump's. Earlier in the year, he voted against a major military aid package for Ukraine.
MARCO RUBIO, potential secretary of state
Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida and 2016 Republican presidential candidate, is also a top secretary of state contender whose policies hew closely to those of Trump. Like Hagerty, he was a contender to be Trump's 2024 running mate.
Rubio has long been involved in foreign affairs in the Senate, particularly as it relates to Latin America, and he has solid relationships throughout the party.
MIKE WALTZ, potential defense secretary
A former Army Green Beret who is currently a U.S. congressman from Florida, Waltz has established himself as one of the foremost China hawks in the House.
Among the various China-related bills he has co-sponsored are measures designed to lessen U.S. reliance on critical minerals mined in China.
Waltz is on speaking terms with Trump and is widely considered to be a serious contender for secretary of defense.
KEITH KELLOGG, potential candidate for national security adviser
A retired lieutenant general who served as chief of staff to the National Security Council under Trump, Kellogg has Trump's ear and is a contender for national security adviser, among other national security posts.
During the campaign, he presented Trump with a plan to end the war in Ukraine, which involved forcing both parties to the negotiating table and ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine for the foreseeable future, among other measures.
MARK GREEN, potential homeland security secretary
A former Army flight surgeon and the current chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, Green is considered by some Trump allies in Washington as a contender for the top job at the Department of Homeland Security . His supporters describe him as a Trump loyalist and immigration hardliner who also has significant legislative experience.
Green was nominated by Trump during his first term to serve as secretary of the Army, but he withdrew his name as past statements, which were widely seen as transphobic and Islamophobic, drew more scrutiny.
CHAD WOLF, potential homeland security secretary
Wolf, who served as Trump's acting secretary of homeland security for roughly 14 months during his first presidency, may have a shot at heading back to DHS.
Wolf loyally carried out Trump's hardline immigration policies, and he deployed federal agents to Portland, Oregon, to control protests during the riots that followed the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white police officer.
He may have some strikes against him. He resigned on Jan. 11, 2021, just days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump has expressed misgivings about bringing back those who resigned in the final days of his term. Wolf, however, cited the legal controversy around his appointment as DHS secretary - rather than the Capitol attack - when he stepped down. Multiple judges ruled that his appointment by Trump, which effectively circumvented the Senate, was illegal.
JOHN RATCLIFFE, potential CIA director
A former congressman and prosecutor who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's last year in office, Ratcliffe is seen as a leading contender to be director of the CIA, according to two people familiar with the transition process. Ratcliffe is also a potential attorney general pick.
The president-elect's allies view Ratcliffe as a hardcore Trump loyalist who could likely win Senate confirmation. Still, during his time as director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe often contradicted the assessments of career civil servants, drawing criticism from Democrats who said he politicized the role.
MIKE LEE, potential attorney general
A U.S. senator from Utah, Lee is widely seen as another top candidate for attorney general. Though the former prosecutor declined to vote for Trump during the 2016 election, he later became an unwavering ally, and he has become something of an intellectual hero among some factions of Trumpworld.
Lee was a key figure in attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, and has spread unfounded conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
KASH PATEL, potential candidate for national security posts
A former Republican House staffer who served in various high-ranking staff roles in the defense and intelligence communities during Trump's first term, Patel frequently appeared on the campaign trail to rally support for the candidate.
Some Trump allies would like to see Patel, considered the ultimate Trump loyalist, appointed CIA director. Any position requiring Senate confirmation may be a challenge, however.
Patel has leaned into controversy throughout his career. In an interview with Trump ally Steve Bannon last year, he promised to ""come after"" politicians and journalists perceived to be enemies of Trump.
During the Trump's first term, Patel drew animosity from some more experienced national security officials, who saw him as volatile and too eager to please the then-president.

Trump spoke repeatedly about his plans to halt illegal immigration and deport migrants he described as ""vicious and bloodthirsty criminals"" if he wins the Nov. 5 election.

Giuliani, a former personal lawyer to Trump, falsely claimed that Harris was ""on the side of the terrorists"" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe used crass language in joking that Latinos ""love making babies"" and called the Caribbean U.S. territory of Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage.""
Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin posted a clip of the comments on his Instagram and wrote, in Spanish, ""This is what they think of us.""

Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, told Reuters that the joke about Puerto Rico ""does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.""
While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, residents of the island cannot vote in U.S. general elections.
However, millions of Puerto Ricans who have moved to the mainland United States can vote, and there is a large community in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
Harris earlier on Sunday visited a Puerto Rican restaurant in Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania. She posted a video on social media promising to ""invest in Puerto Rico's future"" as president.
Harris's campaign in an email said the Madison Square Garden rally was ""mirroring the same dangerously divisive and demeaning message"" as Trump.
Trump's 2016 presidential opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, has accused him of ""re-enacting"" a pro-Nazi rally that was held at Madison Square Garden in 1939 on the eve of World War Two.

Trump’s critics have long accused him of empowering white supremacists with dehumanizing and racist rhetoric.
Trump rejected the comparison to the 1930s. ""This is called Make America Great Again, that's all this is,"" he said on Friday.
“Today this is Donald Trump’s house,” wrestler Hulk Hogan said at the New York event on Sunday. He rejected accusations that Trump is a fascist: “I don’t see any Nazis in here.""
U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, who is supporting Trump's reelection bid with his X social media platform and enormous wealth , was greeted to the stage with chants of ""Elon.""
“This is the kind of positive energy that America is all about,” Musk said.
Musk, who Trump has said he would tap to lead a new government efficiency commission, said the federal budget could be reduced by ""at least"" $2 trillion.
Discretionary spending, including defense spending, is estimated to total $1.9 trillion out of $6.75 trillion in total federal outlays for fiscal 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Trump in his speech argued that Americans are worse off now than four years ago.
He announced a new policy to provide a tax credit for caregivers who take care of a parent or another family member.
Trump touted his foreign policy record during his 2017-21 presidency, and said he would not start wars in office, though he added that if the United States did have a war with China, ""We would kick their ass.""
Polls show Harris and Trump neck and neck in the battleground states that will decide the next president with just over a week until Election Day. More than 38 million votes have already been cast across the country.
Trump has sought to tie Harris to the Biden administration's handling of immigration and the economy. Last week, Trump debuted a new attack line: ""She broke it, and I promise you I will fix it.""
The economy has outperformed the rest of the developed world since the COVID crisis, and stock markets hit record highs this year. But high prices of food, utilities and housing have roiled voters, who believe the economy is headed in the wrong direction.
Harris, who held a rally with Bruce Springsteen in Atlanta on Thursday and with Beyonce in Houston on Friday, will hold another high-profile event with a speech on Tuesday on the National Mall in Washington, where she will highlight the differences between herself and Trump.
""He is full of grievance. He is full of dark language that is about retribution and revenge,"" Harris said of Trump in Philadelphia on Sunday.
Trump's campaign said the event at the 19,500-seat Madison Square Garden, which can cost upwards of $1 million to rent, was sold out. Tickets are free and on a first-come-first-served basis, as was the case with Harris' Houston rally.
A crowd of some 30,000 people attended Harris' rally with Beyonce on Friday night in Houston, and about 20,000 attended the Atlanta rally.
""My internal polling is my instinct,"" Harris said to reporters in Philadelphia when asked how the campaign is faring in its internal election projections. ""The momentum is with us,""

Trump hates Biden's climate law. His allies are making money from it,"WASHINGTON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - (This Oct. 25 story has been corrected to fix comment from Trump’s spokesman to clarify that he did not tell Reuters that a broad rollback of the IRA was a top priority, in paragraph 11
Donald Trump has promised to gut U.S. President Joe Biden's climate subsidies if elected. But many of Trump's allies are benefiting from them thanks to big investments in solar power, electric vehicles, carbon sequestration, hydrogen and other clean energy technologies.

Reuters found at least seven of Trump's close allies and fundraisers, or the firms they run, hold hundreds of millions of dollars-worth of stakes in companies that are significant beneficiaries of the tax breaks embedded in the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden's signature climate law.
They include Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner; his former ambassador to China and continued ally Terry Branstad; and companies run by informal energy advisor and oil mogul Harold Hamm and powerful booster Howard Lutnick.

Big oil companies like Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N), opens new tab and Energy Transfer (ET.N), opens new tab, whose CEOs hosted a May fundraiser in Houston for Trump's campaign with Hamm, also hold major investments in projects that may only be viable if Biden's clean energy tax credits survive.
And Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab, whose founder and CEO Elon Musk has been boosting Trump's campaign, is also benefiting massively from the IRA’s EV and solar credits.

Together, these people and companies hold billions of dollars in investments that qualify for the IRA’s lucrative tax credits and stand to lose big if Trump is able to follow through on his promise to gut Biden’s climate law, according to Reuters reporting.
The investments are important because they raise the likelihood some of Trump's allies may ask him to preserve aspects of Biden’s climate law if he wins the November election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. That would add influential voices to some of the trade groups and lawmakers that have already stood up in favor of specific IRA subsidies.

None of the people or companies identified by Reuters were willing to comment for this story on whether they would intervene to preserve parts of the IRA.
For the time being, Trump’s intentions are clear.
""My plan will terminate the Green New Deal, which I call the Green New Scam, and rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,"" Trump said when he unveiled elements of his economic policy platform in a speech in September.

Trump Campaign Senior Adviser Brian Hughes told Reuters the IRA has contributed to inflation and expanded the federal government's deficit, but did not provide detail on how Trump would deal with the IRA if he regains the White House.
Rescinding any part of the IRA would require an act of Congress.
A group of 18 Republican lawmakers representing districts that have drawn IRA-linked investments sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson in August urging him against revoking all of the IRA if the party wins control of the House and Senate.
The White House said the IRA created more than 330,000 jobs and that gutting it would harm investments made in Republican states.
""By some estimates, more of this investment is occurring in red and purple states,” White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez said.
The Biden administration has already worked to give out the vast majority of IRA grants, but the law’s tax credits are set to continue for years.
Other investors and companies involved in clean energy projects are hopeful that Trump's campaign rhetoric gives way to practicality, should he win in November.
""Innovators and energy companies we work with want policy predictability. They are making hundreds of millions in investments because of the IRA,” said Jeremy Harrell, CEO of Washington-based conservative clean energy organization ClearPath.
Frank Wolak, president of the Fuel Cell &amp; Hydrogen Energy Association, said it will be essential for Congress to protect the tax credits if Trump wins the election.
""We're going to just do some hard educating on the IRA to our congressional allies,"" he said.
ALLIES WITH IRA BENEFITS
- MOSAIC
Trump's son-in-law and former presidential adviser Kushner's private equity fund Affinity Partners in 2022 invested $200 million in Mosaic, a California-based provider of financing for solar energy and home efficiency improvements, according to investment data provider PitchBook.
Founded in 2011 as a crowdfunding startup, the company got a boost from the IRA’s 30% tax credit for residential solar, as well as its consumer incentives for solar panels, electric heat pumps and other efficiencies by raising consumer interest for its clean energy loans.
- SUMMIT CARBON SOLUTIONS
Oil magnate Harold Hamm has long been an energy adviser and political financier for Republican politicians, including Trump, and in May hosted a Houston fundraiser for Trump’s third presidential campaign.
His company Continental Resources in 2022 made a $250 million strategic investment into Summit Carbon Solutions, a carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project that will capture CO2 from ethanol plants and other industrial sources in the Midwest.
That project relies on the 45Q tax credit for various forms of CCS, which the IRA increased sharply across the board.
Though the project was proposed before the IRA was signed in 2022, the enhanced tax credits could yield a $2.9 billion windfall for Summit’s investors, according to Jake Schwitzer, director of policy group North Star Policy Action.
Former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, who served as Trump’s ambassador to China and remains a staunch ally, is Summit’s chief policy advisor.
- TESLA
Tesla is a massive beneficiary of IRA tax credits. The electric vehicle and solar company called the package a “significant boost towards accelerating our mission” shortly after it passed into law in 2022, despite CEO Musk's public hostility toward subsidies.
- OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM
Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub co-hosted the Texas fundraiser for Trump in May, which helped rake in tens of millions for Trump's campaign.
Occidental is a beneficiary of the 45Q carbon capture tax credit and is a recipient of an Energy Department grant of nearly $1 billion to build a direct air capture (DAC) hub to demonstrate that nascent technology at scale. The company has touted its strategy to market so-called ""net-zero"" barrels of oil.
In May, Hollub said in a statement to Reuters: ""I have been talking to policymakers on both sides of the aisle, and will continue to talk to them, to express our support for 45Q, because it will help develop technologies like direct air capture which remove carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere and protect America’s energy security.""
- ENERGY TRANSFER
Energy Transfer's CEO Kelcy Warren is a long-time supporter of Trump. The pipeline operator also participates in projects supported by IRA tax credits, including two planned Louisiana CCS hubs, and a hydrogen hub in Texas that recently won just over $1 billion in Energy Department funding.
- CANTOR FITZGERALD
Trump's transition team co-chair Howard Lutnick is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a major financial services firm that has made significant investments in companies that benefit from the IRA.
As transition co-chair, Lutnick is playing a key role in the search for high-level appointees to staff a potential Trump administration, and he has also served as a high-dollar fundraiser for Trump.
Among the companies that Cantor Fitzgerald has invested in that have benefited significantly from the IRA are Invenergy, a renewable energy firm that is the top constituent of the Cantor Fitzgerald Infrastructure Fund.
The infrastructure fund has over $150 million in total net assets, according to a July press release, and its investment in Invenergy consists of 14.65% of that fund's total investments.
The fund is also heavily invested in NextEra Energy (NEE.N), opens new tab, the largest U.S. renewable energy developer.
Both companies have praised the IRA as helpful to their businesses.
Cantor Fitzgerald has over $13 billion in assets under management and provides a wide array of financial services.

"For Europe's economy, US election risks outweigh upside","Oct 14 (Reuters) - For Europe's economy, the Nov. 5 U.S. election offers a ""least bad"" outcome of a challenging Kamala Harris presidency or a second encounter with Donald Trump which threatens to be yet more bruising than the first.
On two key areas - trade policy and the sharing of rising security costs among NATO allies - Europe expects few favours from a Harris presidency which it sees as ""Biden continuity"".

Trump 2.0, on the other hand, presents multiple dangers: if he were to pull U.S. support for Ukraine, European governments would need to ramp up defence spending fast; and if he triggered a global trade war, Europe fears it would be the big loser.
U.S. stocks fell across the board Monday with the S&P 500 snapping its longest streak of gains in 20 years.




Anti-China measures are a rare area of bipartisan agreement in the U.S. election campaign. For Europe's export-driven economy, that raises the question as to whether it can continue to juggle trade ties with both the United States and China.
""Whoever the winner of the U.S. election is, it is unclear whether Europe can continue to benefit from U.S. growth without reducing trade with China itself,"" said Zach Meyers of the Centre for European Reform (CER) think tank.
""Both U.S. candidates have the same direction of travel - Trump less predictable and perhaps willing to be more confrontational with the European Union.""
For ASML, a Dutch supplier of hi-tech microchip manufacturing equipment, the risk of collateral damage from U.S. efforts to ""contain"" China is all too real - it already faces export bans on half its products to China after a U.S.-led campaign.

Half of Europe's output comes from trade, double the rate in the United States, while the region's 30 million manufacturing jobs - compared to only 13 million in the United States - mean it is highly vulnerable to anything that restricts commerce.

MORE TARIFFS?
Support for free trade in Washington has evaporated in the past decade. Joe Biden chose not to scrap outright tariffs levied in Trump's first presidency and has added his own focus on U.S. jobs with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies.
While Harris is seen pursuing a path similar to Biden, Trump has threatened to go further with across-the-board tariffs of 10-20% on all imports - including those of Europe, with whom America still has annual trade worth over one trillion euros.

Spanish olive producers have seen their exports to United States, once their main foreign market, slump by 70% after Trump in 2018 imposed tariffs which remain in place despite World Trade Organization (WTO) rulings against them.
""If Trump wins, this could get worse and we think it will be difficult to resolve this without pressure from Europe,"" Antonio de Mora, head of ASEMESA, the body which represents Spain's olive exporters, told Reuters.

For those European companies with U.S. presences, the added uncertainty is whether Trump will follow through on promises to scrap Biden's IRA green energy subsidies.
German machinery firm Trumpf, which employs 2,000 U.S. staff and supplies equipment for electric vehicle batteries and solar, told Reuters it was not expanding those activities in the United States due to uncertainty about the election outcome.

The United States is the dominant and still growing market for EU goods exports, while China's share of EU exports has dipped from a 2020 peak.
GROWTH DAMPENER
The U.S. election could also have major implications for the defence budgets of European governments struggling with debt levels inflated by post-pandemic recovery spending.
Again, the question is more one of timing than destination: Harris is expected to pursue U.S. pressure on Europe to pick up more of the tab for regional security while the lack of clarity around Trump's commitment to Ukraine hugely ups the ante.
""In our view, a Trump presidency increases the risk that spending needs to be ramped up sooner, while a Harris presidency may give Europe more time,"" UBS analysts said in a note.
Thus, while a Harris presidency could have little measurable impact on Europe's economy, the downside risks of a second Trump term in office are clearly tangible.
Goldman Sachs economists estimate that if Trump went ahead with his tariffs, their direct effect plus the trade uncertainty they would generate could shave one percentage point off output in the 20 countries of the euro area - more than the weak 0.8% growth they are forecast to eke out this year.
Any economic growth benefits to be had if an ebbing U.S. commitment to Ukraine forced Europe to boost defence spending would be cancelled out by the hit the regional economy would take from the resulting geopolitical risk, they noted.
The European Commission has a closed-door team of officials to study how the EU will be affected by the election outcome. But any policy conclusions they draw will need to secure an EU consensus - which, as shown by the bloc's divisions over how to deal with Chinese electric vehicle imports, can be elusive.
Pro-European optimists suggest the US election - especially in the event of a Trump victory - could have a salutary shock effect of finally spurring the region to adopt the type of deep reforms proposed by former ECB chief Mario Draghi last month.
""The prospect of more tense transatlantic relations should encourage the EU to address the reasons why its economic size has been shrinking relative to the US economy,"" noted CER.

How the world's richest man is helping Trump's presidential bid,"Oct 23 (Reuters) - U.S. billionaire Elon Musk has used his X social media platform and his enormous wealth to support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s efforts to get reelected, going far beyond what political megadonors historically do.
Musk, 53, who has said he has voted for Democratic presidential candidates in the past, has become more publicly right-leaning during this election campaign. He endorsed Trump in July and appeared with him in Pennsylvania this month.

Neither Musk nor the presidential campaign of Democrat Kamala Harris responded to Reuters requests for comment about Musk’s pro-Trump activities.
Here are some of the ways Musk is supporting Trump.
AMERICA PAC
Musk's pro-Trump spending group America PAC is playing a major role in helping mobilize and register voters in battleground states that could decide the election. Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world's richest person, so far has supplied at least $75 million to the political action committee, according to federal disclosures.

America PAC spent around $72 million of that total in the July-September period, according to disclosures filed to the Federal Election Commission. That is more than any other pro-Trump super PAC focused on turning out voters.
America PAC is struggling in some battleground states to meet door-knocking goals and is investigating claims that some canvassers lied about the number of voters they have contacted, Reuters reported last week.

X PLATFORM
Musk has over 202 million followers on the X social media platform, which he bought for $44 billion in October 2022, when it was known as Twitter. Since endorsing Trump, he has used the platform to promote the Republican candidate. Some of his posts spread misinformation and sow doubt about the integrity of the upcoming election.
In July, for example, he commented on a post from Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, writing: “The goal all along has been to import as many illegal voters as possible,” repeating the false claim that Democrats are intentionally allowing non-citizens into the country so that they can vote in the election.

The same month, he shared a video, generated with artificial intelligence and manipulating Vice President Harris’ voice, in which Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, described herself as the “ultimate diversity hire” and criticized President Joe Biden.
Musk has been critical of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs meant to boost racial and ethnic representation at workplaces, posting in January, for example, that “DEI is just another word for racism. Shame on anyone who uses it.”
X and other social media platforms have been under greater scrutiny since 2016, when Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election to try to boost Trump's candidacy and harm his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Since Musk's acquisition of then-Twitter in 2022, civil rights groups have raised concerns over a rise in hate speech and misinformation due to reduced content moderation.
Under X’s current policy, the platform may “label posts containing misleading media to help people understand their authenticity and to provide additional context” or remove misleading posts that have serious risk of harm.
Yet researchers say it continues to be a source of election misinformation, through fake accounts and Musk’s own amplification of that content.
MILLION-DOLLAR GIVEAWAYS
Musk is also promising to give $1 million each day to randomly selected people who sign his online petition pledging to support the First and Second amendments of the U.S. Constitution, which protect the rights to free speech and gun ownership. The petition is only open to signatories who are registered voters in seven battleground states likely to decide the presidential election.
The petition falls into a gray area of election law, and legal experts are divided about whether Musk could be running afoul of prohibitions on paying people to register to vote. Critics say it is a ploy to help drum up support for Trump.
America PAC has been publishing promotional video interviews and photos of people who have won the $1 million giveaways on Musk's X, where they garner millions of views. Petition signers need to provide their address and cellphone number, suggesting they could then be contacted by America PAC door-knockers.
CAMPAIGN BARNSTORMING
Musk joined Trump at an Oct. 5 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the scene of a July assassination attempt against the Republican candidate, and returned to the state for additional campaign stops less than two weeks later.
While touring in Pennsylvania, Musk made a string of false claims about election fraud, some of them echoing those made by Trump the last four years.
He also encouraged people to use his X platform to shine a spotlight on potential election cheating.
“If people think there's a fraud, then they should post the images, post the videos, post the evidence,"" he said.

Trump's impending return to White House brings criminal cases to a halt,"WASHINGTON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory on Wednesday will essentially end the criminal cases brought against him, at least for the four years he occupies the White House.

U.S. Justice Department officials on Wednesday were assessing how to wind down Special Counsel Jack Smith's two criminal cases against the Republican president-elect, due to a long-standing policy that forbids prosecuting a sitting president, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
A New York jury in May found him guilty of falsifying business records tied to the Daniels payment, making him the first former U.S. president convicted of a felony.

Trump told an interviewer on Oct. 24 that he would fire Smith -- who led the federal prosecutions over his attempts to overturn his election defeat and retention of classified documents after leaving office -- ""within two seconds"" of being sworn in.
Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and cast the prosecutions as politically motivated.
""The American people have heard these Democrat prosecutors' cases against President Trump and they're still going to elect him anyway,"" said Mike Davis, the founder of the Article III Project, a conservative legal advocacy group.

Trump will not have the same control over the New York hush money case or Georgia's prosecution of him for trying to overturn his 2020 loss in that state. But his unique role as president makes it unlikely he will face legal consequences in either case during his term in office.
""He was properly charged with crimes within the system we have,"" said Kristy Parker, a special counsel at Protect Democracy, an advocacy organization dedicated to countering what it calls authoritarian threats to the U.S. Parker said if Trump does shut down the cases, ""that won't mean it was the right thing.""

One more court date is scheduled before he is due to be sworn in on Jan. 20, though legal experts said that was unlikely to go forward.
NEW YORK HUSH MONEY CASE
In New York, Trump’s lawyers are expected to ask Justice Juan Merchan to delay his sentencing currently scheduled for Nov. 26 - at which he could face up to four years in prison. Sentencing a president-elect ahead of Inauguration Day would be unprecedented in U.S. history, and legal experts expect the hearing to be delayed.
Merchan has already twice postponed Trump's sentencing, which was initially scheduled for July 11, in part due to a July U.S. Supreme Court ruling finding that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution over their official acts. Trump argues the case should be dismissed based on the ruling, which prosecutors dispute.

Trump has vowed to appeal his conviction once he is sentenced. Separately, his lawyers have asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to move the case to federal court. Such a move, if successful, could create new legal obstacles for the case.
FEDERAL PROSECUTIONS
Trump faces four charges in federal court in Washington accusing him of spreading false claims of election fraud to try to block the collection and certification of votes following the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.
Smith had also charged Trump with unlawfully holding onto classified documents after his first term ended in 2021 and obstructing efforts by the U.S. government to retrieve the records.
Florida-based U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, dismissed all charges in July after finding that Smith was improperly appointed to the role and did not have the authority to bring the case.
The Justice Department filed an appeal in the case.
James Trusty, who previously represented Trump in both matters, said he was not as optimistic that the Justice Department would dismiss the cases on its own.
“My instinct is they would rather sit in status quo or largely status quo, rather than affirmatively pull the plug,"" he said.
""Politically, I think they would rather have the new Trump administration’s fingerprints on the demise of the cases.”
GEORGIA RACKETEERING CASE
Prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, last year used state racketeering laws -- developed to fight organized crime -- to charge Trump in an alleged conspiracy to reverse his defeat in the battleground state in the 2020 election.
Trump will not be able to end the prosecution, but his lawyer has already said in court he will seek to pause any activity related to Trump based on an argument that a president should not face the burden of a criminal prosecution while in office.
Trump and eight of his 14 co-defendants in the case are asking a Georgia appeals court to disqualify the lead prosecutor, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, over alleged misconduct stemming from a romantic relationship she had with a former deputy. Oral arguments are scheduled for Dec. 5.
If that effort fails, the case will be able to proceed against the other co-defendants, who include Trump’s former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. But legal experts expect that the case against Trump will not progress while he remains in the White House.

Trump recaptured the White House by securing more than the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, following a campaign of dark rhetoric that deepened the polarization in the country.

Oil prices , flattened after falling by more than $2 per barrel earlier on a stronger dollar, with some analysts and investors saying the earlier decline was an over-reaction to the election results.
U.S. stocks fell across the board Monday with the S&P 500 snapping its longest streak of gains in 20 years.




Although Trump has long backed U.S. oil and gas production and could introduce heavy tariffs on imports which dampen economic growth and demand for fossil fuels, U.S. oil and gas production already hit record highs under former U.S. President Joe Biden, said Jacob Mandel at consultancy Aurora Energy Research.
Benchmark European gas prices flattened out after rising slightly earlier.
Agricultural commodities rebounded from earlier lows, with corn and wheat turning higher and soybeans paring losses on the back of sharply higher soyoil futures.
A stronger dollar makes U.S. grain more expensive overseas and tariffs proposed by Trump could disrupt U.S. agricultural trade, particularly soybeans to leading importer China, which could retaliate with reduced purchases.

But the peak U.S. soy export season is currently winding down so any impact from Chinese retaliation may not be felt until next summer.
Also, Trump's promised tariff hikes on all imports could curb imports of used cooking oil by biofuels producers, boosting demand for domestically produced soyoil.
Precious metals were still down, with gold prices at a three-week low on Wednesday, while copper lost nearly 4% and is set to post its biggest intraday loss in five months.

Former president Mahama, 65, and current Vice President Bawumia, 60, are the two main contenders for the Dec. 7 election to replace President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is stepping down in January after two terms as head of the gold- and cocoa-producing nation. Eleven other candidates are also running.

Global InfoAnalytics, an Accra-based research group, released poll results on Monday that saw Mahama winning 52%, followed by 41.3% for Bawumia. The poll has a 1.9% error margin.
It found that voters were mainly concerned about the economy, jobs, education and infrastructure.
Mahama invested heavily in infrastructure during his 2012-17 presidency, when he faced criticism for power shortages and economic instability. His government was also embroiled in corruption allegations, although Mahama was never directly accused.

He is running again as the candidate of the main opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC).
Bawumia, an economist and former central banker, is running for the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), which grappled with Ghana's worst economic crisis in a generation.
Both candidates have presented plans to boost the economy and improve livelihoods.
Ghana, the world's second largest cocoa producer, defaulted on most of its $30 billion external debt in 2022 after years of overstretched borrowing.

Akufo-Addo's government secured a 3-year, $3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in 2023 and is now on the final lap of a painful process required for the money to be disbursed.
The Economist Intelligence Unit predicted an NDC win in October due to the NPP's economic record. Fitch Solutions published a similar forecast that month.
Both Mahama and Bawumia are from northern Ghana, a historic NDC stronghold where the NPP has been making inroads.

No party has ever won more than two consecutive terms in Ghana's democratic history.

Trump taps loyalists with few qualifications for top jobs,"Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump chose loyalists with little experience for several key cabinet positions on Wednesday, stunning some allies and making clear that he is serious about reshaping - and in some cases testing - America's institutions.
Trump's choice of congressman Matt Gaetz, 42, for U.S. attorney general, America's top law enforcement officer, was a surprising pick. The former attorney has never worked in the Justice Department, or as a prosecutor, and was investigated by the Justice Department over sex trafficking allegations. His office said in 2023 that he had been told by prosecutors he would not face criminal charges.

Trump tapped Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence. The former Democratic congresswoman-turned-Trump-ally has in the past spoken out against military intervention in the civil war in Syria under former President Barack Obama and implied that Russian President Vladimir Putin had valid grounds for invading Ukraine, America's ally.
""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength,"" Trump said in a statement.

Gabbard has little direct experience with intelligence work and had not been widely expected to be tapped for the post, which oversees 18 spy agencies.
She was deployed in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 as a major in the Hawaii National Guard and is now a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves.
On Tuesday, Trump chose Pete Hegseth, a Fox News commentator and veteran, to be his secretary of defense. Hegseth has opposed women in combat roles and questioned whether the top American general was promoted to his position because of his skin color. He also lobbied Trump during his 2017-2021 term to pardon servicemembers who allegedly committed war crimes.

Sprinkled in with those personnel choices were more conventional selections. Trump said on Wednesday he would nominate Senator Marco Rubio, who is a hardliner on China, as his new secretary of state.
But on the whole, his selections signal a radical shift in the way the U.S. government conducts its business and in the role America will play in the world over the next four years.
Trump has said he wants to end the ""weaponization"" of the Justice Department, which he said brought politically motivated criminal cases against him to hurt his presidential candidacy. The department says it acts without political bias.

LOYALTY
One common thread for Trump's picks: He chose unfailingly loyal people who are unlikely to push back against his most controversial orders, analysts said.
Trump pledged on the campaign trail to go after his political enemies, including Democratic President Joe Biden, a pledge that Gaetz, his attorney general-designate, is unlikely to stand in the way of.
""Gaetz will do exactly as Trump says, which is why he was picked I guess,"" said a source close to Trump, after Gaetz's selection as was announced.

A half dozen sources close to Trump world, including donors, consultants and fundraisers, said privately that they were shocked by the choice of Gaetz because of his limited qualifications and past DOJ investigation into him.
""I was shocked that he has been nominated,"" Republican senator Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine, told reporters about the Gaetz selection. ""The president obviously has the right to nominate whomever he wants. But I think this is an example of why it's so important that we have the advice and consent provisions in the Constitution.""
Some of Trump's other nominees also lack any meaningful qualifications. Hegseth, while a decorated combat veteran, is best known in recent years as a media personality. He will now oversee the better part of 3 million employees and the world's largest fighting force.
""Being secretary of defense is a very serious job, and putting someone as dangerously unqualified as Pete Hegseth into that role is something that should scare all of us,"" said Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic senator from Illinois who sits on the armed services committee.
SENATE GUARDRAIL
Not only are Trump's national security and foreign policy nominees universally skeptical of helping Ukraine fend off Russia's invasion, some of their statements have been outright hostile toward Kyiv.
Gabbard, who will oversee America's sprawling foreign and domestic intelligence apparatus, has portrayed Putin as a defender of his own nation's vital national security interests. Ukraine, she has said, is a corrupt kleptocracy.
One potential guardrail that Trump and his nominees still face: the Senate.
While Trump's Republicans control the Senate and most Republican lawmakers will support his nominees for top jobs, the slate the president-elect put forward will likely give the party's remaining moderates pause and test just how loyal elected Republicans are to him and his vision.
The choice of Rubio as secretary of state could come as a relief to U.S. partners worried that the Trump administration could pull back from its global network of alliances, including NATO, given Trump's ""America First"" emphasis during his campaign to return to the White House.
""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,"" Trump said of Rubio in a statement.
In additional to being a China hawk, Rubio, 53, is an outspoken critic of Cuba's Communist government and strong backer of Israel.
He has in the past advocated for a more assertive U.S. foreign policy with respect to America's geopolitical foes, although recently his views have aligned more closely with those of Trump's approach to foreign policy.
Some analysts questioned whether Rubio would stand up to Trump, noting the president-elect's inclination to make personal loyalty a central requirement for administration posts.
Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said it is essential for any president's advisers to stand up to him when necessary, given the wide array of foreign policy challenges Trump will face.
""I'm trying to keep an open mind here,"" Miller said, noting that Rubio, because of his experience in Congress, has a better grasp of foreign policy than any of Trump's other appointees.

"Americans see immigration as top issue for Trump to tackle, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds","WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Americans see immigration as the most pressing issue for President-elect Donald Trump to address, and a large majority believe he will order mass deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally, a Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed Thursday found.
But respondents to the two-day poll, conducted in the hours after the Republican clinched his election victory, were divided about his plans to expel large numbers of people.

Asked what Trump's top priority should be in the first 100 days following his Jan. 20 inauguration, 25% of respondents said he should prioritize immigration, a much larger share than any other issue. Some 14% of respondents said Trump should focus on income inequality, 12% said taxes and smaller shares picked healthcare, crime, jobs or the environment.
Some 82% of respondents in the poll considered it likely that Trump would order mass deportations, including similar shares of Democrats and Republicans. Many said they are concerned about the expected policy, including 82% of Democrats and 40% of independents. About nine in 10 Republicans said they were not concerned Trump could order mass deportations.

Trump campaigned to return to the White House vowing a vast immigration crackdown, including a promise to deport record numbers of immigrants in an operation Trump’s running mate JD Vance estimated could remove 1 million people per year.
During his campaign, Trump frequently called attention to crimes reportedly committed by immigrants lacking legal status, though numerous studies have shown immigrants do not commit crimes at higher rates than native-born Americans.

Trump backers - including some who could enter his second administration - anticipate the Republican will call on everyone from the U.S. military to diplomats overseas to turn the promise of mass deportations into reality. The effort would include cooperation with Republican-led states and using federal funding as leverage against resistant jurisdictions.
Immigrant advocates warn that Trump’s deportation effort would be costly, divisive and inhumane.

Trump told NBC News in an interview on Thursday that he would carry out his promise of mass deportations regardless of cost, saying, ""It's not a question of a price tag. It’s not — really, we have no choice.""
Americans are divided over the possible mechanics of mass deportations, such as whether they might involve detention camps.
Some 58% of Republicans in the poll - but only 15% of Democrats - agreed with a statement the immigrants without authorization to be in the country should be ""arrested and put in detention camps while awaiting deportation hearings."" About 75% of Democrats opposed rounding up immigrants in that manner, as did 31% of Republicans.

Trump plans to use a 1798 wartime statute known as the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged gang members, an action that would almost certainly be challenged in court.
The law has been used three times, according to the Brennan Center for Justice: the War of 1812, World War One and World War Two, when it was employed to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent.

US Supreme Court girds for rush of election-related litigation,"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Following the 2020 election that he lost to Joe Biden, Donald Trump and his allies brought a storm of legal cases challenging the outcome. After losses in lower courts, some of these cases made their way to the U.S. Supreme Court, whose conservative justices Trump was hoping would ultimately come through for him.
They did not, as the court opted not to hear his appeals. The last three of these were rejected four months post election.

For this year's election - with Trump now seeking to regain the presidency as the Republican candidate facing Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris - there may be a sense of déjà vu for the top U.S. judicial body.
Even before Election Day on Tuesday, a few cases already have reached the justices, one echoing an issue litigated four years ago over Pennsylvania mail-in ballots.
These cases may herald the beginning of what legal experts expect would be a wave of litigation after the election, in particular if Trump loses again in a race that opinion polls indicate is very tight.

""The question isn't whether they're going to bring these claims. The question is whether the court is going to even give them the slightest time of day. And the likelihood is they won't,"" said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a non-partisan group that promotes voter participation and election security.
The Supreme Court, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, this year already has boosted his campaign, reversing in March a decision by Colorado's top court to disqualify him from the Republican primary election ballot in that state under a U.S. constitutional provision involving insurrection. And in July it also ruled that he has broad immunity from criminal prosecution over his efforts to overturn his 2020 loss.

Following the 2020 election, Trump and his allies unsuccessfully filed more than 60 lawsuits trying to overturn the results, often based on false claims of widespread voting fraud or other irregularities.
This election cycle, federal and state courts around the country have been inundated with pre-election litigation - 196 challenges across 40 states so far in 2024, according to Democracy Docket, a litigation tracking website founded by Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
The Republican National Committee is involved in dozens of suits as part a massive ""election integrity"" effort it has said is aimed at making sure votes are properly counted and that people do not vote illegally. The effort has suffered a string of setbacks in courts. Democrats see this litigation blitz as a prelude to Republicans again contesting a potential Trump loss.
Challengers would face high hurdles leveraging pre-election legal claims - particularly ones unsuccessful in lower courts - into post-election attempts to contest the results, said attorney Jason Torchinsky, an election law expert who often has represented Republicans.

""I am skeptical that the Supreme Court is going to determine the outcome of the election unless it is shockingly close,"" Torchinsky said.
There is precedent for the Supreme Court deciding a presidential election's outcome. In 2000, the justices halted a Florida vote recount in a fight over a few hundred votes, effectively handing the presidency to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore.
There currently are fewer avenues for Supreme Court intervention than in the past. Unlike in 2020, when the justices overturned certain federal courts that had ordered last-minute rules changes to facilitate voting amid the COVID pandemic, such developments this time have been rare.
State courts, too, have dealt quickly with numerous lawsuits ahead of the election, notably in Georgia, which like Pennsylvania is among several closely contested states expected to decide the presidential race. In Georgia, judges blocked new rules devised by an election board controlled by Trump allies that could have impeded certification of the state's results.
A NEW LAW
Congress also reduced the potential for post-election chaos by passing the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act. That 2022 law revamped the way a presidential election's outcome is certified in Congress in an effort to avert a repeat of Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to prevent lawmakers from certifying Biden's victory.
Both Trump and Harris will use ""whatever legal tools are available to them,"" said Wendy Weiser, a voting rights expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice.
But, Weiser added, ""All of the scenarios where (the justices) might be invited to get involved are either farfetched or so legally implausible that I think that they're not high risk.""
There are, nevertheless, certain circumstances under which the Supreme Court could get involved, with the likelihood increasing as the winner's margin of victory narrows.
""There still are some issues in Pennsylvania that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not conclusively decided, and it's possible in a post-election environment that the margin is so narrow that some of that lack of clarity could make a difference - and I think that possibly the Supreme Court would have to weigh in,"" Becker said.
The Pennsylvania mail-in ballots case threatened to take on greater significance as Republicans sought the Supreme Court's emergency intervention to block an Oct. 23 state Supreme Court ruling requiring the counting of provisional ballots cast by voters who make mistakes on their mail-in ballots, potentially affecting thousands of votes. But on Friday evening the justices rebuffed that request.
In 2020, Republicans objected to the Pennsylvania court's decision to allow mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and received up to three days later. The justices declined to block that decision and ultimately decided not to hear the case on appeal months after the election.
The Pennsylvania court's ruling this year allowed people who learned that their mail-in vote packages were rejected for lacking a mandatory signature, date or secrecy envelope to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day, and for that vote to be counted.
Weiser said her worry at this point is not the Supreme Court stepping in to determine the election outcome, but rather how the onslaught of litigation is aimed at public opinion.
""I think the biggest play that is being made is to sort of try to delegitimize an outcome in the eyes of the public - or enough of the public so that they are not willing to accept the result,"" Weiser said.

US Senate Democrats rush to confirm judges before Trump takes office,"Nov 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate's Democratic majority began a crusade on Tuesday to confirm as many new federal judges nominated by President Joe Biden as possible to avoid leaving vacancies that Republican Donald Trump could fill after taking office on Jan. 20.
With Republicans set to take control of the chamber on Jan. 3, the Senate on Tuesday held a confirmation vote on one of Biden's judicial nominees - former prosecutor April Perry - for the first time since Trump won the Nov. 5 presidential election. The Senate voted 51-44 in favor of her becoming a U.S. district court judge in Illinois.

All told, Biden has announced another 30 judicial nominees who are awaiting Senate confirmation votes. Sixteen have already have been reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and are awaiting a final confirmation vote by the full Senate. Another 14 nominees are awaiting committee review.
The U.S. Constitution assigns to the Senate the power to confirm a president's nominees for life-tenured seats on the federal judiciary.

""We are going to get as many done as we can,"" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.

Biden has appointed a host of liberal judges. Since the beginning of his presidency in 2021, the Senate has confirmed 214 Biden judicial nominees, including liberal Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. About two-thirds were women, and the same share were racial minorities.

Senate Democrats are under pressure to swiftly confirm the remaining nominees, along with any new picks Biden may name in the waning weeks of his presidency.
How many nominees Senate Democrats will be able to confirm remains to be seen. Trump in a social media post on Sunday called on the Senate to halt approving Biden's nominees, saying, ""Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges.""
Billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk on Tuesday wrote on social media that ""activist"" judicial nominees are ""bad for the country."" Mike Davis, a Trump ally at the conservative judicial advocacy group Article III Project, in another post urged Senate Republicans to vote down all judicial appointments until January.

""The American people voted for monumental change,"" Davis wrote on social media last week. ""Grind the Senate to a halt.""
Current Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell's office declined comment. McConnell has consistently opposed Biden's nominees and, as majority leader, was instrumental in getting Trump's previous nominees confirmed.
Trump's judicial appointees have been involved in major decisions welcomed by conservatives including Supreme Court rulings rolling back abortion rights, widening gun rights, rejecting race-conscious collegiate admissions and limiting the power of federal regulatory agencies.

Judicial nominees require a simple majority for confirmation. Democrats currently hold a slim 51-49 majority, meaning that they can ill afford any defections or absences if Republicans show up in force to oppose Biden's nominees during the chamber's post-election ""lame duck"" session.
West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, has said he would not vote for any nominee who does not garner at least one Republican vote. Must-pass legislation like a spending bill to avert a government shutdown also may consume precious time during the session.
'EVERY POSSIBLE NOMINEE'
Biden's allies have said a concerted push to confirm his remaining nominees would allow him to build on his legacy of helping to diversify a federal bench long dominated by white men.
He is not done nominating judges. On Friday, Biden announced his first post-election nominee, Tali Farhadian Weinstein, who after unsuccessfully running in the 2021 Democratic primary to be Manhattan district attorney was picked for a job as a federal district judge in New York.
A spokesperson for Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and chair of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that he ""aims to confirm every possible nominee before the end of this Congress.""
White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on Monday noted that during Trump's first term, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed 18 judges after Biden had won the 2020 election but before he took office.
Pending nominees include five to the influential federal appeals courts. Republicans said before the election that they had the votes to block two of them: Adeel Mangi, who would become the first Muslim federal appellate judge, and North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park, who unsuccessfully defended the race-conscious admissions policies before the Supreme Court.
There are several others nominated to serve as trial court judges like Perry, a former prosecutor now working at Chicago-headquartered GE HealthCare who would join the bench in Illinois. Biden nominated her to a judgeship in April after her prior nomination to become Chicago's top federal prosecutor was blocked by Republican Senator JD Vance.
Vance began placing a hold on Biden's nominees to the U.S. Justice Department in 2023 after Special Counsel Jack Smith secured the first of two federal indictments against Trump, who subsequently picked the senator as his vice presidential running mate.

"Trump’s Day One: Deportations, border wall, scrapping Biden humanitarian programs","WASHINGTON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Donald Trump is expected to take a slew of executive actions on his first day as president to ramp up immigration enforcement and roll back signature Biden legal entry programs, a sweeping effort that will be led by incoming ""border czar"" Tom Homan and other Republican immigration hardliners, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The executive actions would give federal immigration officers more latitude to arrest people with no criminal records, surge troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and restart construction of the border wall, the sources said.

Homan, who served as acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from 2017-2018 under Trump, will bring a deep understanding of the U.S. immigration system after a four-decade career that took him from a frontline Border Patrol agent to head of the agency that arrests and deports immigrants in the U.S. illegally.
Trump also is expected to end President Joe Biden’s humanitarian programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter legally in recent years and could encourage those with expired statuses to leave voluntarily, according to the sources, who declined to be identified.

“All of these should be on the table,” said Mark Morgan, an immigration official in Trump’s first four-year term who said he did not speak for the Trump transition team.
Trump's early executive actions would kick-start his immigration agenda, which includes a promise to deport record numbers of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimated there were 11 million immigrants without legal status in 2022, a figure that may have increased. Some cities that received migrants, including New York, Chicago and Denver, struggled to house and aid them.

Trump, a Republican, defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in last week's presidential election. He made claims that the Biden administration allowed high levels of illegal immigration a focus of his campaign.
Trump's transition effort remains in its early stages, and plans could change before his inauguration on Jan. 20. A Trump spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Migrant arrests reached a record during Biden’s presidency, straining U.S. border enforcement. But illegal crossings fell dramatically this year as Biden instituted new border restrictions and Mexico stepped up enforcement.

Trump aims to drive illegal crossings even lower and use a whole-of-government approach to arrest, detain and deport large numbers of people.
Trump announced on Sunday night that Homan would serve as a White House “border czar” overseeing security and immigration enforcement. Vice President-elect JD Vance on Monday appeared to confirm that Stephen Miller, architect of Trump’s restrictive first-term immigration agenda, would return as deputy chief of staff for policy, assuring the issue will remain central.
Trump also plans to nominate South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to become secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Noem, whose Midwestern home state is closer to Canada than Mexico, took a hardline stance on illegal immigration and made several trips in recent years to the U.S.-Mexico border, which she called a ""war zone"" in January.
Trump’s aggressive agenda will likely encounter legal challenges from states governed by Democrats, the American Civil Liberties Union and pro-immigration advocates.

DAY ONE TAKES SHAPE
One of Trump’s Day One executive actions is expected to be an order on so-called interior enforcement, arresting and detaining immigrants in the U.S. illegally, the sources said.
Trump intends to scrap Biden administration guidance that prioritized people with serious criminal records for deportation and limited enforcement against non-criminals, they said.
The Trump order would call for deportations to prioritize people charged with felonies and people who have exhausted their legal avenues to remain, but would not restrict officers from picking up other potentially deportable immigrants.
An estimated 1.4 million immigrants in the U.S. have final deportation orders, according to ICE, a group that will be a focus for the incoming Trump administration.
“A federal judge said, ‘You must go home,’ and they didn’t,” Homan told Fox News on Monday.
Certain groups - such as international students who support Palestinian militant group Hamas and have violated the terms of their student visas - could also be listed as a priority, two of the sources said.
ICE could use military planes in deportations and seek help from other government agencies to transport deportees, one source said. “All options are on the table,” the source said.
Another order would deal with border security, the two sources said. Trump intends to send National Guard troops to the border and declare illegal immigration a national emergency to unlock funds for border wall construction, the sources said.
Wall construction in Arizona - where Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs has opposed Republican enforcement efforts - could be a priority, two sources said.
ENDING BIDEN PROGRAMS
Trump plans to end Biden’s temporary humanitarian “parole” programs, which have allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter legally and access work permits, the sources said.
The programs include an initiative for certain migrants with U.S. sponsors and another that allows migrants in Mexico to use an app to schedule border appointments.
People in the U.S. with expired parole status who leave voluntarily could be allowed to apply for legal admission without penalties, the sources said.
Trump is also expected to talk with Mexico about reinstating his “Remain in Mexico” program, which required non-Mexican asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their U.S. cases were decided.

Trump’s ‘America First’ revival could backfire,"NEW YORK, Nov 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - “America First” is returning to the world stage. Donald Trump’s election victory heralds a revival of his nakedly transactional approach to foreign policy and trade. That will further erode global principles and make the United States a less reliable ally. Its friends in Europe and Asia may then hedge their bets, ultimately strengthening its rivals China and Russia.
The president-elect’s first stint in the Oval Office showed that he cares little for rules and alliances but has a fondness for autocrats. More recently he has called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “genius” for invading Ukraine and described Chinese President Xi Jinping as “brilliant, opens new tab” for controlling his people with an “iron fist”.
American ships are being severely overcharged




Trump has also said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” with those members of the NATO defence alliance that do not spend enough on defence. And he has promised to impose 10% tariffs on imports, even from friendly countries.
A relatively benign interpretation of these statements is that Trump still values these partnerships but is making threats to get better deals from allies on defence and trade. Robert O’Brien, who was U.S. national security advisor during Trump’s first term, argues, opens new tab that the president-elect would secure “peace through strength” by a robust foreign policy.

“Washington’s friends would be more secure and more self-reliant, and its foes would once again fear American power. The United States would be strong, and there would be peace,” O’Brien wrote in Foreign Affairs in June.
The snag is that Trump seems happy to throw his weight around to get a better deal even if that means bullying partners. He does not believe in the rules-based order, where principles govern international relations and trade. O’Brien calls it a “fictional abstraction”.

As a result, allies in Europe and Asia will trust the United States less and view it as an unreliable partner. They will look for alternative ways to protect themselves in a world where might matters more than right.
EUROPEAN DANGERS
Ukraine has the most to fear from Trump’s election. He may bully President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to accept a bad peace deal with Russia by threatening to cut off arms supplies unless it agrees terms.

The president-elect has said he could end the war in 24 hours, though he has not said how. His running mate, JD Vance, suggested, opens new tab that a deal could involve Kyiv giving Moscow the territory it currently illegally occupies and a guarantee that Ukraine would not become a member of NATO.
A bad peace deal in Ukraine would undermine the European Union’s defences by strengthening Russia. But Trump’s second term will also pose a broader challenge to the bloc as tariffs would hit its members’ already weak economies.

A shaded map showing aid given to Ukraine by various European countries as a % of GDP
EU countries would ideally close ranks, invest more in their own defence, and provide more aid to Ukraine so it could keep fighting if the United States cut it off. But there is little chance that the EU, which has weak powers over foreign and defence policy, will do anything so bold. Some of the same nationalistic sentiments that helped Trump win are buoying right-wing political parties in Europe, many of whom are sympathetic to Russia. That makes it hard to agree on common action at the European level.
What is more, Germany and France, the EU’s two leading powers, are in the midst of political crises. Add in the fact that many governments have weak finances and it is hard to see Europe coming together strongly in the face of geopolitical threats.
It is more likely that each country will seek to put together a patchwork of deals. Some will seek to curry favour with Trump, some will cosy up to Putin and some will try to do both.
China will exploit these divisions. It will argue that Europe should make common cause with it on trade if both face U.S. tariffs. And it will do the same on fighting global warming if Trump carries out his threat to once again pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement.
ASIAN RISKS
Xi will be looking for any opportunity to advance his ambition to incorporate Taiwan into China. He might interpret pressure by Trump on Ukraine as a sign that the United States would also do little to defend Taipei, especially as the president-elect has accused Taiwan of “stealing” the U.S. semiconductor industry.
Other American friends and allies in the Asia-Pacific region are already nervous about Trump’s return. Any weakness towards Taiwan would make them doubly so. Japan and South Korea will be less sure that the United States would defend them if China decided to bully them. As a result, they may seek to build their own nuclear weapons.
Meanwhile the Philippines, which has been shifting towards the United States partly to protect itself from Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, may in future be reluctant to antagonise Beijing. Vietnam, which has also been edging towards Washington, could conclude this was no longer wise. Even India, which became closer to the United States after a border dispute with China, has been repairing its relationship with the People’s Republic.

If China was able to dominate countries in its neighbourhood, it would establish itself as the undisputed hegemon of East Asia. If its close ally Russia was at the same time able to bludgeon Ukraine into a bad deal, the two powers would collectively have a strong position throughout Eurasia.
China argues that the United States is in decline. This is not entirely true. While it no longer dominates the global economy as it did in the 1960s, its long-term prospects may be better than those of the People’s Republic and its demographics certainly are.
But these are not the only reasons the United States is the world’s most powerful nation. Since World War Two, it has invested in a global network of alliances and the rule of law. If Trump imperils these, he may find that putting “America First” fulfils the prophecy of American decline.

Europe's imports of U.S. crude oil have climbed to a record so far in 2024 but the continent's overall crude imports have contracted by around 1%, showed data from Kpler.

This indicates that European energy product importers have scope to reduce purchases of U.S. LNG and crude as overall gas use remains stunted while crude supplies from alternative sellers are abundant.
IN THE CROSSHAIRS?
European policymakers are already planning responses to Trump's intended tariff impositions, wary of a potential deterioration in economic ties with a key trade partner while embroiled in a trade spat with China.
Trade experts in Brussels - home to the European Union's policy arm - will want to avert any further souring in the region's economy and will likely seek to maintain strong ties with the U.S. during Trump's next term.
However, they will not shy away from proposing tariff measures of their own during negotiations, if only to avert being steam-rolled by blanket tariff threats from the U.S.
U.S. energy products are likely to be an attractive option for retaliatory tariffs as Europe can readily source LNG and oil from other keen sellers and thereby hurt U.S. suppliers without harming their own consumers.
U.S. RISK
On paper, U.S. energy product exporters could redirect cargoes to other buyers if Europe somehow becomes shut off during a trade scuffle.
But in reality, the loss of European buyers would be a heavy blow to U.S. firms, especially LNG exporters.
All current U.S. LNG export terminals are located on either the East Coast or in the U.S. Gulf and so are better situated to service a Pan-Atlantic trade route than across the Pacific to buyers in Asia.
The U.S. to Europe journey is also only a fraction of the distance and time to major buyers in Asia.
The roughly 12-day trip from Cove Point LNG terminal in Maryland to Wilhelmshaven in Germany - a major European LNG import hub - is a third of the time of the trip to Guangdong in China, the world's largest LNG buyer.
Longer journeys mean longer turnaround times for LNG sellers, who need speedy vessel turnover to maximise revenue.
So while U.S. sellers could feasibly maintain total export volumes by redirecting cargoes if Europe became off limits, they would most likely incur sharply higher shipping costs and longer return times if they had to go to Asia instead.
Crude sellers would face similar woes if European buyers also opted for other sellers as global oil consumers are already well served by exporters from the Middle East and elsewhere.
This means that while U.S. energy exporters can expect to boost output volumes under the next administration, they also face a growing risk of a trade skirmish with key European buyers that may make selling those extra volumes a challenge.

Polls show the race between Harris and Trump as tight. Arab and Muslim Americans overwhelmingly backed President Joe Biden in 2020 but have been vocal opponents of U.S. support for Israel, which has eroded their backing of Democrats.
Trump has historically had low approval from that community due to past statements and his policy of a travel ban targeting Muslim-majority nations when he was in office. Like Harris and Biden, Trump has also been a vocal supporter of Israel.

Trump escalates false election claims in battleground Pennsylvania,"PHILADELPHIA, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his supporters are spreading false claims about the election in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of Tuesday's vote, escalating concerns in a state that could tip the outcome of the race.
Trump on Thursday stepped up his unfounded allegations that probes into suspect voter registration forms are proof of voter fraud. Some of his supporters alleged voter suppression when long lines formed this week to receive mail-in ballots.

State officials and democracy advocates said the incidents show a system working as intended. A judge extended the mail-in ballot deadline by three days in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, after the former U.S. president's campaign sued over claims that some voters were turned away before a Tuesday deadline.
Election officials discovered potentially fraudulent registrations in Lancaster and neighboring York counties, prompting investigations by local law enforcement. There is no evidence the applications have led or will lead to illegal votes.

""This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working,"" Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania's top elections official, told reporters this week.

""The facts are there were thousands of fraudulent voter registrations dumped, and voters were turned away throughout Pennsylvania,"" Republican National Committee spokesperson Claire Zunk said. ""We are fighting to protect every legal vote and stop Democrat election interference.""
SOWING SEEDS OF CHALLENGES
Democracy advocates hear echoes of Trump's 2020 attempt to overturn his loss, which culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.

""This is sowing the seeds for attempts to overturn an election result that cuts against Donald Trump,"" said Kyle Miller, a Pennsylvania policy strategist for the advocacy group Protect Democracy. ""We saw it in 2020 and I think the lesson Trump and his allies have learned since is that they have to sow these ideas early.""
A senior Harris campaign official on Thursday said Trump's claims were an example of the former president trying to ""sow doubt in our elections and institutions when he's afraid he can't win.""
In Lancaster County, in southeastern Pennsylvania, the clerk of elections reported that she received about 2,500 applications close to the Oct. 21 voter registration deadline, according to Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams.
""Staff noticed that numerous applications appeared to have the same handwriting, were filled out on the same day with unknown signatures, and some were previously registered voters” whose signatures on file did not match those on the application,” Adams said at a press conference last week.
She said that the forms appeared to be connected to a paid, “large-scale canvassing operation” that had been operating since June, signing up voters at public places like shopping centers, grocery stores and parks. She did not identify the operation.
York County said in a statement it declined about 740 registration applications, many of which were duplicates, received as part of a large batch last week. The county district attorney is reviewing those applications, according to the statement.
Schmidt, the state's top elections official, said local law enforcement investigations would determine if criminal charges are warranted in either case.
State officials have expressed concern about online disinformation undermining trust in the process.
U.S. intelligence agencies determined that a video purporting to show ballots being torn up in Bucks County was manufactured and spread by Russian actors as part of Moscow's effort to stoke divisions over the election.
Bucks County officials said a miscommunication led security to briefly turn away some voters from the county election office on Tuesday, when a long line formed ahead of a 5 p.m. deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot. State officials had previously said anyone in line by 5 p.m. would be accommodated.
Bucks County said in a statement it was pleased that a judge later extended the mail-in ballot deadline until Friday.
In Colorado, which is seen as solidly Democratic, the Trump campaign has also sought to exploit an admission from the secretary of state's office that partial passwords to voting systems were included in a spreadsheet posted the office's public website.
The campaign on Thursday asked the state to halt the processing of mail-in ballots and to prepare to re-scan all of them over the issue.
The office previously said the disclosure will not impact how ballots are counted.

""I want to talk about IVF. I'm the father of IVF, so I want to hear this question,"" Trump said.
Hearing that some women were concerned about possible restrictions on fertility treatments, Trump touted his party's support for the procedure, even though some conservative Republicans do not support in vitro fertilization.
Senate Republicans blocked Democratic-led legislation designed to protect IVF access twice in recent months, with some Republicans arguing the legislation is unnecessary as IVF access is not in danger.

""We really are the party for IVF,"" Trump said. ""We want fertilization that is all the way, and the Democrats tried to attack us on it, and we're out there on IVF, even more than them.""
IVF emerged as a hot-button issue in the election after the conservative Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos are children. That ruling left it unclear how to legally store, transport and use embryos, prompting some IVF patients to consider moving their frozen embryos out of the state.

Republicans nationwide scrambled to contain the backlash from the decision, while Democrats warned more reproductive rights could be under threat.
Trump's campaign described his ""father of IVF"" comment as a joke.
""It was a joke President Trump made in jest when he was enthusiastically answering a question about IVF as he strongly supports widespread access to fertility treatments for women and families,"" spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.

Harris, when asked about Trump's comments, warned against being ""distracted by his choice of words.""
""The reality is his actions have been very harmful to women and families in America on this issue,"" Harris told reporters.
According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week, 49% of women who are registered to vote support Harris, while 40% support Trump.
Polls also show Americans broadly trust Democrats more than Republicans on reproductive rights.

Trump, who as president appointed three of the justices who made up the majority that ended constitutional protection for abortion, has said the matter should now be decided by individual states.
He also has said he would support making IVF free of charge, though he has not detailed how he would do so.
'ENEMY FROM WITHIN'
At times during the town hall, Trump returned to the dark language that has been a hallmark of many of his campaign stops.
Trump warned of the danger posed by an ""enemy from within"" - a phrase he has used before - and he called his opponents ""evil.""
""They're really very different, and it is the enemy from within, and they're dangerous,"" Trump said, while discussing his political foes.
Trump was responding to a comment from Fox host Harris Faulkner, who noted that Harris had criticized an interview Trump gave to Fox News on Sunday, during which he had called Democrats the enemy from within.
During that interview, Trump suggested that the National Guard or army could be deployed to handle ""radical-left lunatics.""
As he is out of office, Trump has no authority to order such a deployment though he repeatedly expressed interest in using the military to quell civilian protesters during his 2017-to-2021 term, according to former advisers.

The Civil Rights Division is expected to shift its focus away from police accountability toward defending religious freedom and filing legal challenges against government and private sector diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
Legal experts said Trump's pledge to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies could undermine the impartiality of career prosecutors and shatter norms of prosecutorial independence, which were reinforced after the Watergate scandal and the 1974 resignation of Republican President Richard Nixon.

Bradley Moss, an attorney specializing in national security law, said the combination of a politicized Justice Department and a July U.S. Supreme Court ruling that presidents have broad immunity from criminal liability for official acts would give Trump great leeway.
""Donald Trump is coming into power for a second time armed with experience, with a chip on his shoulder and armed with a Supreme Court ruling on immunity,"" Moss said. ""He is going to bend and twist and push the boundaries of presidential power anywhere and everywhere he wants to.""

RETRIBUTION, REVENGE
Trump sounded warnings throughout his campaign, telling supporters in 2023, ""I am your retribution."" More recently, he has toned down his language, saying several times this year that his revenge would be ""success.""
A Trump transition team spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
A range of people have been under consideration for attorney general, including Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey; former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton; Robert Giuffra, an attorney with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell; U.S. Senator Mike Lee and Matthew Whittaker, who briefly served as acting attorney general during Trump's first term, according to sources familiar with the discussions.
""The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring an orderly and effective transition to the new Administration,"" a department spokesperson said.
On the campaign trail, Trump spoke openly about seeking retribution against those he says persecuted him during his 2017-2021 White House term.
The list of targets he has pledged to investigate or prosecute include Democratic President Joe Biden and his family; Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who secured criminal convictions of Trump over charges stemming from a hush money payment to a porn star; Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led two federal prosecutions against Trump that are now being wound down, and members of the congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot by Trump supporters trying to overturn his election defeat.
Trump has said Republican former congresswoman Liz Cheney, a harsh critic of his false claims of 2020 election fraud, should be tried for treason and that Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, should be executed.
He has called for the prosecution of both New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose civil fraud case against The Trump Organization resulted in penalties of $364 million, and Arthur Engoron, the judge in that case.
Steve Bannon, a former Trump White House adviser, referenced Bragg, James and Smith on Tuesday as he left a New York criminal court, telling reporters: ""The hunters are about to become the hunted.""
Mark Zaid, an attorney representing government workers, said he has received dozens of calls a day from former and current government officials worried about a second Trump term.
Zaid said he has advised a small number of them to take trips abroad around the Jan. 20 Inauguration Day and to stay overseas for at least two weeks to gauge how serious Trump is about exacting revenge.
""They keep saying they are going to retaliate and Trump says he is going to fulfill all his promises,"" Zaid said.

US yields post sharp gains as Trump victory triggers caution about deficits,"NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries fell sharply on Wednesday, propelling yields to multi-month highs as Donald Trump's presidential election victory ignited bets on economic policy shifts that could boost deficits and inflation.
The Republican former President swept back to power early on Wednesday, beating Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris and capping a political comeback four years after he left the White House.

U.S. stocks fell across the board Monday with the S&P 500 snapping its longest streak of gains in 20 years.




The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.479%, its highest since July, as polls also showed Republicans winning control of the Senate and a close race for the House of Representatives.
The 10-year yield, which moves inversely to the price, was last up 15.3 bps at 4.441%, on track for its biggest one-day rise since April.
U.S. yields, however, pared gains after a better-than-expected 30-year Treasury bond auction.
Trump campaigned on a platform of tax cuts, which economists say would juice the economy, widen budget deficits and increase government borrowing. He also touted tariffs, which analysts expect to stoke inflation and reduce the Federal Reserve's scope to cut interest rates.

""The risk in the market with Trump is an undisciplined fiscal situation. At some point in 2025, the deficit will grab the narrative of the market,"" said James Camp, managing director of fixed income and strategic income at Eagle Asset Management in St. Petersburg, Florida.
""If you believe that the gap between rhetoric and policy could be a mile-wide ... there is still an impulse from Trump on the spending side that would be bearish for bonds. The leaning in bonds is to be cautious given the results.""

The yield on the 30-year Treasury note last traded 16.5 bps higher at 4.612%, after earlier hitting 4.678%, the highest since late May. It is set for its biggest one-day rise since March 2020, underscoring concerns about future borrowing.
SOLID US 30-YEAR BOND AUCTION
Wednesday's sale of $25 billion worth of 30-year bonds lured buyers after being sharply sold off. The note was priced at 4.608%, lower than the rate forecast at the bid deadline, suggesting investors did not demand extra yield to take down the note.

There were $66 billion in bids for a 2.64 bid-to-cover ratio, up from 2.50 previously and the 2.31 from the August new issue.
Meanwhile, the MOVE index (.MOVE), opens new tab, the benchmark gauge of rate volatility, hit a more than one-year high of 136.25 on Monday, suggesting Treasury yields across most maturities will move at least 8.5 basis points per day in either direction over the next month. It was last at 130.43.

Harley Bassman, creator of the MOVE index and managing partner at Simplify Asset Management, predicted that based on his calculations, option prices anticipate an outsized move of 18 basis points in Treasury yields a day or two after the election. That was roughly the size of the move so far on Wednesday.
Treasury yields surged once it became clear Trump had considerably improved on his 2020 election performance against President Joe Biden.
On the short end of the curve, the two-year yield peaked at 4.312%, its highest since late July, and last traded roughly 7.5 bps higher at 4.278%. It was on pace for its biggest one-day gain in a month.

The U.S. yield curve steepened sharply on Wednesday, with the gap between two-year and 10-year yields hitting 19.5 , the highest since late September. The curve was last at 16.10 bps, from 8.8 bps late Tuesday.
The curve has been on a steepening trend for the last few months, a scenario that occurs when the Fed is cutting interest rates.
The Fed, meanwhile, kicks off its two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday and is expected to deliver another 25-bps rate cut, though future decisions look less certain.
Traders have reacted to the election results by trimming bets on Fed cuts next year, with rates seen staying above 4% until May 2025. The market has priced in about 42 bps of cuts this year and another 62 bps of reductions in 2025. Next year's estimate came down from about 90 bps a few weeks ago, based on LSEG's calculations.
""I start to worry when yields cross the 4.50% mark,"" said Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management.
""If we don't reverse that upward trend, I would be more reticent to add too much more risk until we hear from the Fed or get a little bit more guidance with respect to where terminal rates might lie.""

Kremlin says 'let's see' if Trump victory will help end Ukraine war,"MOSCOW, Nov 6 (Reuters) - The Kremlin reacted cautiously on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, saying the U.S. was still a hostile state and that only time would tell if Trump's rhetoric on ending the Ukraine war translated into reality.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 triggered the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when the Soviet Union and the U.S. came close to nuclear war.

In Congo, the M23 rebels now face a mundane but daunting new task, governing.




Trump's re-election caps a remarkable comeback four years after the Republican was voted out of the White House and ushers in a new American leadership likely to test democratic institutions at home and relations abroad.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump had made some important statements about wanting to end the Ukraine war during his campaign, but only time would tell if they led to action.

""Let us not forget that we are talking about an unfriendly country, which is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state"" (in Ukraine),"" Peskov told reporters.
Peskov said he was not aware of any plans by President Vladimir Putin to congratulate Trump on his victory and that relations with Washington were at an historic low.
""We have repeatedly said that the U.S. is able to contribute to the end of this conflict. This cannot be done overnight, but... the U.S. is capable of changing the trajectory of its foreign policy.

Russian and U.S. diplomats say relations between the world's two largest nuclear powers have only been worse during the depths of the Cold War. Russian officials from Putin down said ahead of the election that it made no difference to Moscow who won the White House, even as Kremlin-guided state media coverage showed a preference for Trump.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow had no illusions about Trump, noting that there was what it called a bipartisan anti-Russian position among the U.S. ruling elite designed to try to contain Russia.

""Russia will work with the new administration when it 'takes up residence' in the White House, fiercely defending Russian national interests and focusing on achieving all the set objectives of the special military operation (in Ukraine),"" the ministry said.
""Our conditions are unchanged and are well known in Washington.""
Kirill Dmitriev, the influential head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, struck a softer note, saying a Trump victory could be a chance to repair ties.

""This opens up new opportunities for resetting relations between Russia and the United States,"" added Dmitriev, a former Goldman Sachs banker who has previously had contacts with the Trump team.
WAR IN UKRAINE
Trump, 78, has promised to swiftly end the war in Ukraine, though he has not explained exactly how he would do that.
Putin has said he is ready for talks, but that Russia's territorial gains and claims must be accepted, something that the Ukrainian leadership has rejected as an unacceptable capitulation.
Russian forces are advancing at the fastest pace in at least a year in Ukraine and control about one fifth of the country.
That includes Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, about 80% of the Donbas - a coal-and-steel zone - and more than 70% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.
Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday that Trump's win would probably be bad news for Ukraine, which relies on Washington as its top military backer.

What are Donald Trump’s proposed policies as president?,"WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's second presidential term could have huge implications for U.S. trade policy, climate change, the war in Ukraine, electric vehicles, Americans' taxes and illegal immigration.
While some of his campaign proposals would require congressional approval, here is a summary of the policies Trump has said he will pursue after he takes office on Monday.
The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here.
MORE TARIFFS
Trump has said he will issue executive orders on his first day in office to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico if the two U.S. neighbors do not clamp down on the flow of drugs into the U.S. and people entering the country illegally. The duties could severely impair the highly integrated economies, where auto parts can cross borders multiple times before final assembly.




Trump has also called for a global tariff of at least 10% on all goods imported into the U.S., a move he says would eliminate a $1-trillion annual trade deficit. Critics say it would lead to higher prices for American consumers and draw retaliatory duties on American exports.
Trump has said he should have the authority to set higher tariffs on countries that have placed tariffs on U.S. imports, frequently complaining about Europe's higher duties on autos. At times on the campaign trail, he threatened tariffs of 200% on vehicles made in Mexico, especially if Chinese automakers launch production there.

Trump has targeted China in particular in an effort to decouple the world's two largest economies. He has proposed tariffs of 60% or more on all Chinese imports, far above his first-term tariffs, in part to phase out imports of Chinese electronics and pharmaceuticals. He also has said he wants to prohibit Chinese companies from owning U.S. real estate and infrastructure in the energy and tech sectors.

MASS DEPORTATIONS
Trump has vowed to reinstate his first-term policies targeting illegal border crossings and to forge ahead with sweeping new restrictions.
He has pledged to limit access to asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border and to embark on the biggest deportation effort in American history, which would likely trigger legal challenges and opposition from Democrats in Congress.
He has said he will employ the National Guard, and, if necessary, federal troops, to achieve his objective, and he has not ruled out setting up detention camps to process people for deportation.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
Trump has said he would seek to end automatic citizenship for children born to immigrants. While such a move would run against the long-running interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, Trump has said he would consider trying to push through a new amendment that would achieve his aim.
He is expected to try to revoke protected legal status for some populations such as Haitians or Venezuelans, but would try to seek a congressional deal to protect ""Dreamers"" - children of parents who came to the country illegally.

Trump says he will reinstitute a version of his ""travel ban"" policy that restricted entry into the U.S. of people from Muslim-dominant countries and other nations, and sparked multiple legal battles during his first term.
Some of Trump's earliest appointments reflected an urgency to follow through on his immigration agenda. Trump has named a ""border czar,"" Tom Homan, and will make Stephen Miller, the architect of his immigration plans, a White House deputy chief of staff.
DRILLING AWAY
Trump has vowed to increase U.S. production of fossil fuels by easing permitting and expanding drilling on federal land. He has said he would support widespread oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
Trump has pledged to create a National Energy Council to coordinate policies to boost U.S. energy production, led by his pick for interior secretary, former North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.
Whether the oil industry follows through and raises production - which is already running at record highs - remains to be seen.
Trump is likely to again pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate deal, a framework for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, and would support increased nuclear-energy production.
He would also roll back Democratic President Joe Biden's electric-vehicle mandates and other policies aimed at reducing auto emissions.
Trump has argued the U.S. needs to boost energy production to be competitive in developing artificial-intelligence systems, which consume large amounts of power.
TAX RELIEF
Along with his trade and energy agendas, Trump has promised to slash federal regulations that he says limit job creation. He has pledged to extend personal income-tax cuts that he signed into law in 2017 but which are due to expire on Dec. 31, and he has proposed a number of individual and corporate tax cuts beyond those enacted in his first term.
Trump has pledged to reduce the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for companies that make their products in the U.S.
He has said he would seek legislation to end taxation of tips and overtime wages to aid waiters and other service workers. He has pledged not to tax or cut Social Security benefits.
Trump also has said he would pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates - but would stop short of demanding it.
Most, if not all, of his tax proposals would require congressional action. Budget analysts have warned that the bevy of tax cuts would balloon the federal debt by trillions of dollars over a decade without savings elsewhere.
DOING AWAY WITH DIVERSITY PROGRAMS
Trump has pledged to require U.S. colleges and universities to ""defend American tradition and Western civilization"" and to purge them of diversity programs. He said he would direct the Justice Department to pursue civil rights cases against schools that engage in racial discrimination.
At K-12 schools, Trump would support programs allowing parents to use public funds for private or religious instruction.
Trump has also suggested abolishing the federal Department of Education and leaving states in control of schooling.
NO FEDERAL ABORTION BAN
Trump appointed three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who were part of the majority that overturned the court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision that ruled there was a constitutional right to an abortion. He likely will continue to appoint federal judges who would uphold abortion limits.
At the same time, Trump has said a federal abortion ban is unnecessary and that the issue should be resolved at the state level. He has argued that a six-week ban favored by some Republicans is overly harsh and that any legislation should include exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother.
Trump has suggested he would not seek to limit access to the abortion drug mifepristone after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the government's approach to regulating it.
He supports policies that advance in vitro fertilization, birth control and prenatal care.
A PUSH TO END WARS
Trump has been critical of U.S. support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, and has said he could end the war in 24 hours if elected - although advisers concede it will likely take months if not longer.
He has suggested Ukraine may have to yield some of its territory if a peace deal is to be struck.
Trump and his pick for national security adviser, U.S. Representative Michael Waltz, have criticized the Biden administration's decision in November to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided missiles to strike within Russian territory.
Trump has also said that under his presidency the U.S. would fundamentally rethink NATO's purpose and NATO's mission.
Trump named U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a China hawk, as his secretary of state, charged with carrying out his foreign policy goals.
Trump has backed Israel in its fight against Hamas in Gaza and hailed a ceasefire deal announced on Wednesday that could see the eventual withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the release of hostages captured by Hamas.
Trump is likely to push for historic normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, an effort he made during his 2017-2021 presidency and which Biden has also pursued.
He has urged the U.S. to stay out of the conflict in Syria that has seen longtime leader Bashar al-Assad deposed.
Trump has suggested building an ""iron dome"" - a missile-defense shield similar to Israel's - over the entire continental U.S.
Trump has also floated the idea of sending armed forces into Mexico to battle drug cartels and using the U.S. Navy to form a blockade of that country to stop smuggling of the opioid fentanyl and its precursors.
His transition team has been drawing up lists of potential high-ranking U.S. military officers to fire as part of a purge of the Pentagon of those believed to be ""disloyal"" to Trump.
INVESTIGATING ENEMIES, AIDING ALLIES
Trump has pledged at times to use federal law enforcement agencies to investigate his political foes, including election officials, lawyers and party donors.
Trump tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his attorney general and former national security aide Kash Patel as his choice to lead the FBI. Both have expressed sympathy for Trump's desire to exact retribution on some of his critics, although Trump of late has said that he will not direct them on how to do their jobs.
He has said he would consider firing a U.S. attorney who did not follow his directives - which would constitute a break with the longstanding U.S. policy of an independent federal law enforcement apparatus.
Trump has said he will likely pardon many of those who have been convicted of crimes in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. In December, he suggested members of the congressional committee that investigated the attack should be jailed.
In addition to criminal investigations, he has suggested using the government's regulatory powers to punish those he views as critics, such as television networks.
PURGING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY
Trump would seek to decimate what he terms the deep state – career federal employees he says are clandestinely pursuing their own agendas – through an executive order that would reclassify thousands of workers to enable them to be fired. That would likely be challenged in court.
He has said he will set up an independent government efficiency panel headed by billionaire supporter Elon Musk and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to root out waste in the federal government. The government already has watchdogs such as the Office of Management and Budget, and inspectors general at federal agencies.
Trump would crack down on federal whistleblowers, who are typically shielded by law, and would institute an independent body to ""monitor"" U.S. intelligence agencies.

The fee will start at $900 per metric ton of methane emitted in 2024, and increases to $1,200 in 2025, and $1,500 for 2026 and beyond. Under the rules, it would only apply to facilities that release more than 25,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalent, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's announcement.

The U.S. had led the push for a Global Methane Pledge, a voluntary pact signed by over 100 countries that seeks to cut global methane emissions 30% by 2030. The world's top oil and gas producer has also made cooperation on methane a centerpiece of its climate engagement with China.

Trump has said he would ""rescind all unspent funds"" under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris administration’s signature climate law.
The 2022 law includes hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for electric vehicles, solar and wind energy, and other clean energy technologies and has drawn huge investments in domestic manufacturing in those industries.
Any changes to the law would require an act of Congress and several Republican lawmakers have expressed support for keeping it, or parts of it, in place. Many of Trump’s allies benefit from the IRA through their investments in clean energy technologies.

Harris backs the IRA and has said her administration would keep making investments in clean energy if she won the election.
PARIS AGREEMENT
During his 2017-2021 term as U.S. president, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, an international pact to fight climate change, arguing it was unnecessary and put the country at a competitive disadvantage to China.
Trump’s campaign said he would do it again if he wins.
Harris would keep Washington in the deal, which Biden swiftly rejoined in 2021.
THE GRID
Trump’s campaign has said the Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to support adoption of electric vehicles and eventually curb the use of fossil fuels poses a risk to the nation’s power grid at a time of soaring electricity demand. It pledged changes that would ease permitting for new power plants.
In April, Biden's Environmental Protection Agency finalized rules targeting pollution from power plants, an industry responsible for nearly 25% of U.S. carbon emissions. The rules will effectively require coal-fired power plants and new natural gas-fired generators in the coming decade to capture emissions before they reach the atmosphere.
In a Sept. 5 speech, Trump slammed the rule, saying it set the stage ""for a catastrophic energy shortfall that will make inflation far worse.""
""I will immediately issue a National Emergency Declaration to achieve a massive increase in domestic energy supply,"" Trump said in the speech. ""With these sweeping authorities, we will blast through every bureaucratic hurdle to issue rapid approvals for new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, and new power plants and reactors.""
Harris’ campaign has also promised to speed up permitting, but mainly for projects that have low or no emissions.
""A Harris-Walz Administration will do this by continuing to invest in a thriving clean energy economy and helping realize the full potential of those investments by cutting red tape so that clean energy projects are completed quickly and efficiently in a manner that protects our environment and public health,"" according to her campaign website.
Trump also opposes U.S. auto-emissions regulations announced in March, lumping them into a group of Biden’s green initiatives that he says are distorting markets, driving up prices and limiting consumer choice.
Trump has also promised to put an end to the offshore wind industry, already struggling under the weight of high costs and local opposition to projects. The policy differs from that of his first administration, which supported the technology.
Harris supports both offshore wind and EVs.
LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS
The Biden-Harris administration froze new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permits in January to study their environmental impacts, an election-year move that pleased green groups and voters.
If Harris wins, she will likely be tasked with unwinding the pause and incorporating any new recommendations from the promised review, which the administration says is expected to land after the vote.
Trump has said he would immediately lift the freeze, while Harris’ campaign has said her approach on LNG will be guided by the review's outcome.

Biden's promise of a return to a more humane immigration regime than under Republican former President Donald Trump soon collided with the reality of a spike in illegal border crossings.
The Supreme Court upended the legal landscape around abortion rights by overturning Roe v. Wade, inflaming one of the most divisive issues in American politics.
And despite Biden's pledge that America would serve as a stabilizing force in the world, overseas conflicts have overshadowed his presidency.

Whoever triumphs in the election - Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris - will inherit the legacy of a Biden administration that made good on some promises, saw others swept off-course by events, and others still only partially fulfilled. Here's how Biden fared on the defining issues of his presidency.
IMMIGRATION
Biden, a Democrat, started his presidency by reversing many of Trump’s restrictive immigration policies. He haltedconstruction of Trump’s border wall; rescinded bans targeting people from certain majority-Muslim countries and other nations; and wound down the “remain in Mexico” program, which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as they pursued their U.S. cases.

But months into his presidency, illegal crossings spiked, particularly among unaccompanied children from Central America, overwhelming U.S. border processing centers and fueling Republican criticism.
Illegal crossings reached record levels in 2022 and 2023 as more migrants arrived from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and countries outside the hemisphere.
In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, in 2022 beganbusing arriving migrants north to Democratic cities including New York City and Chicago, which struggled to house them.

In January, Biden backed a bipartisan bill that aimed to tighten border security. After the bill was defeated in the U.S. Senate amid Trump's opposition, Biden in June bannedasylum for most migrants crossing the border illegally.
The number of migrants caught crossing illegally dropped dramatically, undercutting Trump's false claims that Harris and Democrats support an open border.
Despite the political pressures surrounding migration, Biden created new legal pathways for hundreds of thousands of migrants and oversaw the restoration of the U.S. refugee program, which admitted more than 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the most in 30 years.
ABORTION
The biggest upheaval on abortion access in decades occurred during Biden's presidency - but because of a decision by the Supreme Court.
In June 2022, the conservative majority formed by Trump's judicial appointments to the court eliminated the nearly 50-year-old federal right to abortion under Roe v. Wade.
The decision ushered in a period in which individual states set their own laws on abortion access. More than a dozen states banned abortion in all or most cases.
Biden condemned the Supreme Court ruling, and his administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department, laid out guidelines to ensure access to emergency abortion care under federal law and defended the use of the abortion pill before the Supreme Court.
The administration also pushed for expanded access to reproductive health services like contraception through the Affordable Care Act.
The administration won its biggest victory in June when the Supreme Court rejected a case brought by anti-abortion advocates seeking to roll back the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, one of two medications used in the abortion pill regimen.
But the court dismissed on procedural grounds the administration's case arguing that Idaho's severe abortion ban conflicted with a federal law requiring medical providers to offer stabilizing emergency care, including abortions. In October, the court declined to hear a similar administration case about Texas' strict abortion ban.
While devoutly Catholic Biden was openly uncomfortable about abortion from early in his political career, mitigating the impacts of the dissolution of Roe v. Wade has become a pillar of his presidency.
Democrats more broadly made abortion rights central to their platform in the 2022 midterm elections. In March, Harris became the first sitting vice president or president to visit an abortion clinic.
ECONOMY
Joe Biden may go down in history as overseeing the best economy that everyone hated.
Since 2021, as the country emerged from a global pandemic that briefly created historic job losses and brought the economy to a near-standstill, employers have added nearly 16.5 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has averaged just 4.2%, including the longest run at 4% or below since the 1960s.

Gross domestic product growth has averaged 3.2% per quarter, well above what most economists view as the U.S. economy's long-term potential. Incomes and wages have grown above trend. Collective U.S. household net worth has climbed to a record $163.8 trillion, thanks to a booming stock market and rising home values.
But survey after survey over most of Biden's term has shown little of that registering with average Americans. Why? Because all of that occurred against the backdrop of the worst inflation breakout in a generation.
As the economy reopened, a mix of tangled supply chains, worker shortages and hot consumer demand, supported by roughly $5 trillion of government stimulus from Biden's and Trump's administrations, sent prices climbing - fast.
By the summer of 2022, the Consumer Price Index was rising by 9.1% year-over-year and the widely followed gauge of household satisfaction with the economy - the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index - tumbled to a record low.
While inflation has receded and sentiment has begun to recover, surveys show Americans still feel the sting of lingering high prices, and they blame Biden and Democrats for it.
RACIAL JUSTICE
On his first day in the White House, Biden signed an executive order aimed at addressing racism, police brutality, poverty and inequities impacting Black people and other communities of color.
But reform has been slow. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, introduced in 2021 to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics and racial bias, stalled in Congress.
In 2022, Biden issued an executive order directing the Department of Justice to create a national database of misconduct by federal law enforcement officers and requiring federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the use of deadly force or deaths in custody. It also restricted federal agencies from using chokeholds and ""no knock"" entries.
While Biden's Justice Department revived investigations into civil rights abuses, which had largely stopped under Trump, it has failed to secure a single binding settlement in the 12 investigations opened into possible police civil rights abuses since Biden took office.
On the economic front, Black unemployment fell to a historic low last year. This year alone, the administration directed $1.5 billion in loans to Black-owned businesses. It has also invested more than $16 billion in historically Black colleges and universities and distributed $2.2 billion to more than 43,000 Black and other farmers who experienced discrimination. Last year, the Biden administration allocated $470 million to improve maternal health.
FOREIGN POLICY
From wars in Ukraine and Gaza to civil bloodshed in Sudan, overseas conflicts have dominated Biden's foreign policy agenda.
Biden came to office promising to restore U.S. global leadership in the world and determined to push back on an increasingly aggressive China.
In some ways, his administration has done just that. After the chaotic 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Biden rallied U.S. allies the following year to oppose Russia's invasion of Ukraine and has also revitalized alliances across Asia to pressure China's leadership.
But the U.S. has struggled to bring the grinding conflicts to an end, and hasn't been able to prevent the deepening ties between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.
Now in its third year, the war of attrition in Ukraine continues despite billions of dollars in U.S. military aid and massive losses on both sides. The conflict is increasingly international, with Western accusations that Moscow is receiving weapons and soldiers from North Korea, missiles and drones from Iran and technical and other support from China.
The war between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, which started when Hamas fighters staged a deadly attack into Israel, has metastasized into conflict between Israel and Lebanese militants Hezbollah and sparked reprisal attacks between Israel and Iran.
Biden's staunch support for Israel has divided his party and undercut the United States' ability to criticize others on human rights and violations of international law.
A conflict in Sudan has triggered ethnic violence and famine conditions in Sudan's Darfur region, where violence about 20 years ago led to the International Criminal Court charging former Sudanese leaders with genocide and crimes against humanity. The United States has been trying to help broker an end to the 18-month-long conflict.
ENERGY TRANSITION
Biden entered the White House with huge ambitions to fight climate change by transitioning the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels to cleaner, renewable sources - all while creating new green, unionized jobs and re-shoring U.S. manufacturing. Among his goals: put an end to federal oil and gas leasing, expand deployments of solar and wind energy to decarbonize the power grid, electrify the nation’s vehicle fleet, and ultimately put the economy on a path to become carbon-neutral by 2050.
On the win side of the ledger, Biden signed into law three pieces of legislation that have driven a massive investment in the clean energy economy: the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act, which aims to establish a domestic semiconductor supply chain that could insulate the domestic energy sector from supply shocks.
Under the IRA, companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in new solar, wind, electric vehicles and infrastructure, battery storage and other climate-friendly projects that have sped up the energy transition and created jobs – largely in Republican states whose lawmakers did not support the legislation.
The administration has awarded $90 billion in grants to climate, clean energy, and other projects under the IRA, or about 70% of the law’s climate-focused grant money, according to administration officials.
The Biden administration also expanded federal leasing for renewable energy projects, and passed new regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.
On the loss side, his administration’s attempts to end federal oil and gas leasing failed in the courts, and his policies failed to prevent a massive surge inU.S. oil and gas output– mostly on privately owned lands in Texas and New Mexico - that has made the U.S. the world’s top petroleum producer.
And in perhaps the best litmus test of Biden’s climate actions, projections from the Rhodium Group show U.S. greenhouse gas admissions set to decline by 32-43% by 2030 under current policies, short of Biden's 50-52% goal.

But a Trump win could stymie that rally, with technology, defence and export sectors in the crosshairs of his policies.
Since both Democrats and Republicans are relatively united in antagonism to China, markets may not react dramatically until concrete policy changes are announced.
""Although both candidates are probably hawkish toward China, Trump is still less predictable in terms of policy, so the prospect of a Trump win could still drag sentiment a bit,"" said Kenny Ng, strategist at China Everbright Securities International in Hong Kong.

Onshore markets are, however, holding out for more stimulus proposals and details from the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), which meets through Nov. 4-8.
""Onshore investors are more focused on the NPC meeting this week and are waiting to see if there will be more forceful stimulus coming through, which will have a bigger impact on the markets compared to the election,"" Ng said.
The offshore yuan fell more than 1% versus the dollar, to its weakest since mid-August. Its onshore counterpart was also down more than 0.8%, and China's major state-owned banks were selling dollars to prevent the yuan from weakening too fast, sources told Reuters.
Trump's proposed tariff and tax policies are viewed as inflationary and therefore likely to keep U.S. interest rates high and undermine currencies of trading partners.
During Trump's first presidency, the yuan weakened about 5% against the dollar during the initial round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018, and fell another 1.5% a year later when trade tensions escalated.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated Trump on Tuesday's election victory, but were also quick to stress the challenges posed by his ""America First"" protectionist trade policy and isolationist rhetoric.

They've defeated Congo's army to take control of the eastern part of one of Africa's most populous nations.




""The European Union must stand close together and act in a united manner,"" Scholz told reporters, adding that he and Macron were coordinating closely with other EU heads of state and government.
Macron said on X that Berlin and Paris would work for a united, stronger Europe within ""the new context"".
Achieving European unity will however be challenging, not least because over the past years Paris and Berlin have been increasingly at odds on issues ranging from how to finance increased defence spending to trade, and in particular tariffs on China's electric cars.

The French and Germany leaders are also in delicate political positions at home, with Macron losing much of his power after defeats in elections earlier this year and Scholz struggling to keep his coalition together.
""Contrary to claims, Europe is not prepared for the economic impact of higher tariffs, the likely U-turn on Ukraine, and defence spending ultimatums – we expect the EU to divide on similar lines to the US itself,"" Eurointelligence analysts said.

TRADE WARS?
Many European officials had said ahead of Tuesday's election they were worried about a Trump win, given tense transatlantic relations in his first term, his strong criticism of NATO, his ambivalent view of Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion and stance on climate change.
One particular concern for Europe is trade: Trump said last month the European Union would have to ""pay a big price"" for not buying enough American exports if he won the election.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen congratulated the Republican former president on his victory but also said avoiding trade wars would be in the U.S interest as well as Europe's.
""Millions of jobs and billions in trade and investment on each side of the Atlantic depend on the dynamism and stability of our economic relationship,"" she said.
Trump, who will take office in January, has said he would impose a 10% tariff on imports from all countries, and 60% duties on imports from China. This would hit supply chains throughout the world, likely raising costs, and China seeking to divert its exports towards Europe, economists warn.

UKRAINE
Another worry for Europe is shifting U.S. foreign policy, in particular on the war in Ukraine. Trump has criticised the level of U.S. support for Ukraine's war effort and before the election promised to end the conflict before even taking office, without explaining how.
Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who unlike other EU leaders had openly endorsed Trump's presidential bid and posted enthusiastic messages on X on his victory, said Europe would now need to rethink its support of Ukraine. Orban has regularly angered Brussels with his close ties to Russia and opposition to aid for Ukraine.
NATO chief Mark Rutte was among many others in Europe who congratulated Trump and hoped for good cooperation, with several ministers saying his return to the White House would require Europe to take greater responsibility for its security.
""We must now think big and make big investments in our European security,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Berlin.
France and Germany's defence ministers were due to hold a hastily arranged meeting later on Wednesday in Paris, ahead of long-planned meetings of dozens of European leaders in Budapest on Thursday for a European Political Community summit and a meeting of EU leaders, also in Budapest, after that.
The EU summit will allow for a first exchange of views but was unlikely to bring a full response to Trump's win, one European diplomat said.

Trump wants to compare now to four years ago. Here’s what it looks like,"WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump's end-of-campaign arguments to voters choosing between him and Democrat Kamala Harris have focused on an old standby in U.S. politics: Asking voters whether they are better off now than they were four years ago.
He may want to check his dates. In 2020, the last year of Trump's presidency, U.S. life expectancy fell by 1.8 years because of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a National Center for Health Statistics review of the year, and more than 350,000 people died from the virus, which made it the third-leading cause of death.

The U.S. economy experienced one of its worst-ever quarters, when gross domestic product plunged at a 28% annual rate from April through June. Despite a startling rebound in the three months that followed - largely the result of federal deficit spending on benefits approved by both parties to keep households afloat through the health crisis - the U.S. economy was smaller in the final full quarter of Trump's term - the fourth quarter of 2020 - than it was at the end of 2019.

To be fairer to himself, Trump might want to dial the calendar back a year to 2019, but even then the record is mixed. If one thing stands out about now versus then it is how similar many aspects of the economy look, a testament, many economists feel, to the success of the largely bipartisan effort to keep a health catastrophe from becoming an economic one.
THE TALE OF THE TAPE: GDP
Data released on Wednesday showed the economy continues to grow above trend and close to the 3% rate Trump in his first term set as a barometer of success.

After adjusting for inflation the economy overall is 11.5% larger now than it was at the end of 2019, when output under Trump reached its peak. Growth rates were comparable: From the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of this year, inflation-adjusted output rose 2.66%; in the comparable pre-COVID quarters, comparing the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2018, the economy expanded 2.8%.

INFLATION
For many Americans, the outbreak of inflation from 2021 through last year was something they had never experienced. At its peak prices were rising faster than at any point since the 1980s, an era when economic malaise undercut the reelection campaign of Democratic President Jimmy Carter.
High prices have been a centerpiece of Trump's campaign, and one which Harris has had trouble rebutting even as inflation itself has declined. The fact that ""disinflation"" has occurred without the usual blow to economic output and employment is seen by policymakers as a historic victory, but seems to have registered only weakly, if at all, with households.

INCOMES
Another point that has registered weakly among U.S. consumers is that incomes on the whole have kept pace with all that inflation. Economic surveys have consistently found that this doesn't really matter when it comes to attitudes about the economy: High prices are high prices, and if food costs 10% more consumers don't really care if their wages went up enough to cover it and then some.
Nor do averages capture every household's experience.
Still, while the bumps along the way were dramatic as federal spending boosted incomes for a while then rising prices cut into purchasing power, inflation-adjusted income per person was about 10% higher as of the third quarter of this year than it was in the third quarter of 2019.

UNEMPLOYMENT

As Federal Reserve officials have noted, the labor market was strong under Trump before the pandemic. It snapped back afterwards under Biden as well.
Ignoring the sharp up and downs of the pandemic years, the unemployment rate was slightly lower on average from 2022 through this year than it was from 2017 through 2019.

Peru reflects a wider challenge for the White House around South America, where China's presence has grown rapidly given its huge appetite for the region's main exports: corn, copper, soy, beef and battery-metal lithium.
That's made Beijing the go-to trade partner from Brazil to Chile and Argentina, eroding Washington's regional political clout, a trend that widened under Trump's 'America First' inward turn during his first administration and again under Biden.

The LDP has held an outright majority since it returned to power in 2012 after a brief spell of opposition rule. It also lost power briefly in 1993, when a coalition of seven opposition parties formed a government that lasted less than a year.
Smaller parties, such as the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) or the Japan Innovation Party, could now prove key to forming a government.
The DPP won 28 seats and the Japan Innovation Party 38 seats, according to NHK. But both propose policies at odds with the LDP line.
DPP chief Yuichiro Tamaki has not ruled out some cooperation with the LDP-led coalition, but Innovation Party head Nobuyuki Baba has rejected the idea.
The DPP calls for halving Japan's 10% sales tax until real wages rise, a policy not endorsed by the LDP, while the Innovation Party has pledged tougher donation rules to clean up politics.
""The DPP is focused on ultimately making the country better and ensuring financial resources are allocated more appropriately, so that's why I decided to vote for them,"" Keisuke Yoshitomi, a 39-year-old office worker, said after casting his vote at a polling station in Tokyo.
Political wrangling could also be a headache for the Bank of Japan (BOJ) if Ishiba chooses a partner that favours maintaining near-zero interest rates when the central bank wants to gradually raise them.
The Innovation Party opposes further increases in interest rates, and the DPP leader has said the BOJ may have been hasty in raising rates, while the central bank wants to gradually wean the Japan off decades of massive monetary stimulus.
""With a more fluid political landscape, pushing through economic policies that include raising taxes, such as to fund defence spending, will become much harder,"" said Masafumi Fujihara, associate professor of politics at Yamanashi University.
""Without a strong government, it would be more difficult for the BOJ to raise rates and keep the weak yen under control.""

The Trump campaign is broadly reliant on outside groups for canvassing voters, meaning the super PAC founded by Musk - the world's richest man - plays an outsized role in what is expected to be a razor-thin election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Justice Department sent a letter to America PAC warning that the giveaways may violate federal law, CNN reported on Wednesday.
The petition falls into a gray area of election law, and legal experts are divided about whether Musk could be running afoul of prohibitions on paying people to register to vote.

Trump's win emboldens dollar bulls as they brace for tariffs,"NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House is putting a spotlight on the U.S. dollar, which could have far-reaching implications for everything from domestic manufacturers to emerging markets if the currency's rally continues.
The U.S. currency notched its biggest one-day gain against its peers in eight years on Wednesday, one day after Trump was re-elected president and Republicans won control of the Senate while making gains in the House of Representatives. The dollar is up 3.8% this year and stands at its highest level in four months.

U.S. stocks fell across the board Monday with the S&P 500 snapping its longest streak of gains in 20 years.




How much further the dollar climbs could hinge on whether investors believe Trump will enact the tax cuts and tariffs that are key elements of his economic platform. While those policies could boost growth, they risk ramping up inflation and could keep U.S. interest rates far above those of other countries. Higher rates raise the dollar’s allure to investors.
At the same time, a strong dollar could hurt U.S. companies - one reason why the president-elect periodically railed against a rising dollar during his first term.
""A Trump administration likely means more spending, a hotter economy and high bars for international trade - all things that spell strength for the dollar,"" said Helen Given, associate director of trading at Monex USA.
RATES TRAJECTORY
The path of interest rates is key to the dollar’s future prospects. The Federal Reserve kicked off its most recent monetary easing cycle with a 50-basis-point rate cut in September and is expected to announce a 25-basis-point reduction at the conclusion of this week's two-day monetary policy meeting on Thursday.

Expectations of rate cuts helped weaken the dollar earlier this year.
But prospects of heightened inflation could make policymakers wary of overheating the economy by cutting rates too deeply. Traders on Wednesday trimmed bets on how much the Fed would lower rates next year to about 42 basis points, from 62 basis points last month, based on LSEG's calculations.
""I would describe this as a tectonic shift in currency markets,"" said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of fixed-income and currency strategy at Amundi US. Investors now “have to take into account trade tariffs and the implications it will have on the U.S. inflation outlook, on the global growth outlook and ... how the Fed will react to it.""

A so-called Red Sweep scenario in which Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress could make it easier for Trump to enact tax cuts and give Republicans more leeway for their economic agenda.
While Republicans were set to hold a majority of at least 52-48 in the U.S. Senate, final control of the lower chamber was yet unclear, with vote counting still underway.
Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, believes the dollar could gain another 5% in a Red Sweep scenario and advance further in coming months as more of Trump's agenda is enacted.

Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20.
In 2016, the dollar rose about 6% against a basket of currencies in the first two months after Trump's election victory but gave up those gains in subsequent months. The dollar went on to rally about 13% between February 2018 and February 2020 when Trump implemented tariffs against several countries, including China and Mexico.
RIPPLE EFFECTS
A rising dollar could be a double-edged sword for the U.S. economy, helping tamp down inflation while hurting the competitiveness of American products abroad. It could also pressure the profits of multinational U.S. companies that need to convert their foreign profits into dollars.

A study by JPMorgan found that every 2% increase in the trade-weighted dollar shaves 1% from S&P 500 earnings growth, according to strategists at JPMorgan.
Should a rising dollar become a headwind for growth, Trump might exhort the Fed to cut interest rates or push U.S. trading partners to boost their own currencies.
Trump could also employ the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which was created in the 1930s as a tool for stabilizing the exchange rate and now has about $215 billion. Trump did not use the fund during his first term, and analysts are skeptical of how effective such a measure would be in reining in the dollar without a global effort or support from the Fed.
""Trump's preference for a weaker dollar would have to be accommodated by and in coordination with the Federal Reserve, which we view as unlikely,"" analysts at Wells Fargo wrote in a Wednesday report.
Given the dollar's role as a linchpin of the global financial system, persistent strength in the U.S. currency could ripple out to other assets.
A strong dollar could be particularly unwelcome for emerging market countries, especially nations that have borrowed heavily in the U.S currency since a rising dollar would make it more difficult for them to repay their debts.
That could pressure central banks in those countries - as well as some developed countries such as Japan - to hike rates in an effort to defend their own currencies, said Bechtel, of Jefferies.
""You're going to enter this new regime of currency war that used to flare up from time to time in the past,"" he said.
Some investors believe tariffs could eventually end up hurting the U.S. economy, because they can increase costs for businesses and consumers, disrupt supply chains and reduce trade volumes. All that could reduce the prospects for dollar strength down the road.
A study by Deutsche Bank said tariffs would subtract about a quarter of a point from U.S gross domestic product if implemented.
""The reality is that a full flight protectionist agenda will ultimately rebound on the American economy and slow growth,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at payments company Corpay.

"Iranians worried, elated, wary in mixed reaction to Trump win","DUBAI, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election drew mixed reactions among ordinary Iranians, with some fearing a heightened risk of war and economic hardship but others hoping his hardline stance might bring political change in Iran.

Some Iranians like retired teacher Hamidreza feared further economic pressure with Trump in the White House if he continues the same tough policy he adopted in his 2017-2021 first term.
""I am disappointed Trump won. It means more economic pressure, the risk of a war with Israel. I am deeply concerned,"" said Hamidreza, 66, in the northern city of Rasht.
""I don’t care who the U.S. president is. My main concern is Iran’s economy. If they lift sanctions on Iran, that would be a good thing,"" said government employee Nader, 34, a father of two in the southern city of Ahvaz.

“Everyone is happy, and I am thrilled. Trump is a no-nonsense leader who will put pressure on the clerical rulers. This is good for the Iranian people who seek a democratic leadership,"" said Parastou, a 21-year-old student in Tehran.
Like Zohre, Hamidreza and Nader, Parastou declined to be identified in full due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Publicly, Iranian political leaders have downplayed the significance of the U.S. election result on Tehran's policies.

However, the establishment's main concern is the potential for Trump to empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites, conduct assassinations and reimpose his ""maximum pressure"" policy through heightened sanctions on the country's oil industry.
Some, however, suspect Trump will be cautious about the possibility of war.
""Trump is a businessman. He knows Iran is powerful and can turn the Middle East to hell if attacked. He wants to end wars in the region not fuel it,"" said Reza Mohammadi, a member of Iran's volunteer Basij militia in the central city of Isfahan.

'WE HAVE TO MAKE A DEAL'
In 2018, the then-Trump administration exited Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with six major powers and reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to violate the pact's nuclear limits, such as rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output.
Efforts to revive the pact have failed, but Trump said in his campaign in September that ""We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal"".

It was the bite of U.S., EU and U.N. sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program that forced Tehran to reach the 2015 nuclear pact, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions.
Trump's tough stance could force Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say in the country's foreign and nuclear policy, to approve talks ""whether direct or indirect"" with the United states, two Iranian officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
After casting his vote, Trump told reporters that ""I don't want to do damage to Iran, but they cannot have nuclear weapons"".
Iranian analysts and insiders did not dismiss the possibility of a detente between Tehran and Washington ""without restoring diplomatic ties"".
""Iran will act based on its own interests. It is possible that secret talks between Tehran and Washington take place. If security threats against the Islamic Republic are removed, anything is possible,"" said Tehran-based analyst Saeed Laylaz.
While facing off against arch-foe Israel, Iran’s clerical leadership is also concerned about the possibility of an all-out war in the region, where Israel is engaged in conflicts with Tehran's allies in Gaza and Lebanon.
In an election speech in October, Trump stated his unwillingness to go to war with Iran, but said Israel should ""hit the Iranian nuclear first and worry about the rest later"", in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel on Oct. 1.
Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Iranian military targets, especially missile production sites, on Oct. 26.

Politically toxic inflation may curb Trump agenda,"LONDON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - If inflation is as politically toxic as this week's resounding U.S. election result suggests, the presumed impact of his economic policy proposals should make President Donald Trump hesitate on his return to the White House.
The scale of the Republican candidate's comprehensive victory laid waste to pre-election polling and predictions of a tight state-by-state battle. And it left many wondering why a still-booming economy near full employment counted for so little in appraising the incumbent Democrats.

The Dow slipped a quarter of one percent while the S&P 500 dropped six tenths, and the Nasdaq declined about three quarters of one percent.




After all, the state of the economy was cited as the most or second-most important issue for the majority of voters in exit polls released on Tuesday.
But when voters said ""economy"", it masked the emphasis on ""inflation"". Many Americans still appear to blame the Democrats for the years of high inflation that squeezed household budgets following the pandemic, even though that inflation rate was clearly exaggerated by global events and has fallen back sharply this year.
But as is always the case with inflation, containment doesn't reverse prior price gains. It merely slows the pace of their onward march. The broad consumer price index is up more than 20% over the past four years. And there is also research showing that consumption baskets adjusted for households in the lowest two income deciles are up almost twice that, substantially outpacing their wage gains.

That's not to say inflation, or even the economy at large, was the only reason for Trump's win. But Edison's exit polling data showed 45% of voters across the country said their family's financial situation was worse today than four years ago, compared with just 20% in 2020.

Trump's sweeping global tariff proposals and looser fiscal policy - if implemented - are widely expected to rekindle consumer price rises.
""A blanket 10-20% implementation of tariffs on all trading partners by a Trump administration and a minimum of 60% import tariffs on China would likely be inflationary, both on producer prices and on consumer prices,"" said Zehrid Osmani, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton's Martin Currie unit.

What's more, Trump's draconian anti-immigration stance could add more fuel to prices by tightening labor markets once more and spurring wages.
""The most inflationary aspect of Trump's program is his desire to withdraw millions of immigrant workers from the job market, which is already under pressure,"" said Edmond de Rothschild AM's Michael Nizard.
And financial markets reflect these concerns. U.S. Treasury bond yields surged following the election result on Wednesday, and one-year inflation swaps rose more than 10 basis points to top 2.6% for the first time in more than a year.
In response, futures markets started pricing in one fewer Federal Reserve rate cut next year, and the dollar soared - likely to the chagrin of soft dollar advocates like many on Trump's team.

COOL THE ENGINES
But given the potentially dire political consequences of aggravating inflation, might Trump's re-flationary agenda be tempered once reality sets in for the new administration?
Some think that may just be what will happen and are cautioning financial markets to cool their engines for now.
""There is the potential for Trump to not walk the talk,"" said Martin Currie's Osmani.
And Eurizon SLJ's Stephen Jen also doubts we'll see much of the Trump tariff plans, given the impact on ""the single-biggest complaint the voters have"".
""If inflation has proven to be so politically poisonous, why would Trump knowingly repeat the exact same mistakes he is accusing the Biden administration of having committed?"" Jen wrote on election eve. ""It makes zero sense to me.""
Trump 1.0 has a track record on that, however, even if the broader economic backdrop in 2016-2020 was very different from what we're seeing today.
Whatever eventually happens, inflation has proven itself to be an uncomfortable political bedfellow - and politicians home and abroad may now be far more cautious about re-awakening it.

A U.N. spokesperson said at the time the proposed cuts would have made it impossible to continue all essential work.
""The U.N. secretariat has known that they could face a Trump comeback all year. There has been prudent planning behind the scenes on how to manage potential U.S. budget cuts,"" said Richard Gowan, U.N. director at the International Crisis Group.
""So (U.N. Secretary-General Antonio) Guterres and his team are not totally unprepared, but they know the next year will be extremely hard,"" he said.

Trump's team did not immediately respond to a query about his policy toward the U.N. after he takes office in January.
During his first term, Trump complained that the U.S. was shouldering an unfair burden of the cost of the U.N. and pushed for reforms. Washington is traditionally slow to pay and when Trump left office in 2021 the U.S. was in arrears about $600 million for the core budget and $2 billion for peacekeeping.
According to U.N. figures, President Joe Biden's administration currently owes $995 million for the core U.N. budget and $862 million for the peacekeeping budget.
""I don't want to pre-empt or speak about policies that may or may not happen, but we work with member states in the way we've always worked with member states,"" Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Wednesday.
In 2026, the U.N. Security Council will choose Guterres' successor, a decision in which the Trump administration will hold a veto power.
'GREAT NEWS FOR CHINA'
During Trump's first term, he was critical of the United Nations and wary of multilateralism. He announced plans to quit the World Health Organization, and pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, a global climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal.
When Biden succeeded him in 2021, he rescinded the U.S. decision to withdraw from the WHO and returned the U.S. to UNESCO and the climate agreement. Trump's campaign has said he would quit the climate deal again if he won office.
""It will survive. But, of course, it will probably survive severely undermined,"" Guterres told Reuters in September of a second withdrawal from the climate pact by Trump.
Ahead of the U.S. election, a senior European diplomat said a Trump win would be ""great news for China,"" recalling that during Trump's first term ""the Chinese influence in the U.N. increased a lot because it was an open bar for the Chinese.""
The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if Trump again cuts U.N. funding and withdraws from international pacts ""it will just give China the opportunity to present itself as the supporter number one of multilateralism.""
U.S. funding for some other U.N. agencies is also in question. One of the first moves by the Trump administration in 2017 was to cut funding for U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), the international body's agency focused on family planning as well as maternal and child health in more than 150 countries.
Trump's administration said UNFPA ""supports ... a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization."" The U.N. said that was an inaccurate perception. Biden restored U.S. funding for UNFPA.
If Trump again cuts funding, UNFPA warned that ""women will lose lifesaving services in some of the world's most devastating crises"" in places like Afghanistan, Sudan and Ukraine.
Under Trump's first presidency, the U.S. also opposed long-agreed international language on women's sexual and reproductive rights and health in U.N. resolutions over concern that it would advance abortion rights.

"Stenographers object to press office alteration of Biden's 'garbage' comment, AP reports","WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - White House stenographers objected to press officials' alteration of U.S. President Joe Biden's transcribed response to comments at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's weekend rally disparaging Puerto Rico, according to the Associated Press.
In remarks to Latino activists this week, Biden responded to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage"" at Trump's Sunday rally at New York's Madison Square Garden. Hinchcliffe also disparaged Black Americans, Jewish people, Palestinians and Latinos.

Biden, a Democrat, quickly moved to clarify his remark after Trump and other Republicans seized on his response ahead of Tuesday's presidential election and accused Biden of vilifying all Trump supporters. Biden said he was referring to ""hateful rhetoric"" at Sunday's rally.
""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American,"" Biden said on Tuesday night's call with activists according to an official transcript prepared by government employees, AP reported on Thursday.

A transcript released by the White House press office, however, included an apostrophe — ""supporter's"" — suggesting Biden was criticizing one supporter, Hinchcliffe. Both words sound the same, making it unclear from audio of Biden's call with activists which version he meant.
An internal email from the stenographers' office said the change was made after the press office conferred with Biden. The stenographers' supervisor wrote that the move was a breach of protocol because the press office should not have edited the transcript, the AP reported.

Exclusive: China's Xi pressed Biden to alter language on Taiwan,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING/TAIPEI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden last year to change the language the United States uses when discussing its position on Taiwanese independence, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the private conversation.
During last November's Biden-Xi meeting near San Francisco, Xi and his aides asked Biden and his team to tweak the language in U.S. official statements.

China wanted the U.S. to say ""we oppose Taiwan independence,"" rather than the current version, which is that the United States ""does not support"" independence for Taiwan, said the people, who requested anonymity to speak about private diplomatic exchanges they participated in or were briefed on.
In Congo, the M23 rebels now face a mundane but daunting new task, governing.




Xi's aides have repeatedly followed up and made the requests in the months since, according to two U.S. officials and another person familiar with the exchanges.
The U.S. has declined to make the change.
The White House responded to a request for comment with a statement that repeated the line that Washington does not support Taiwan independence. ""The Biden-Harris administration has been consistent on our long-standing One China policy,"" the statement read.

China's foreign ministry said: ""You should ask this question to the U.S. government. China's position on the Taiwan issue is clear and consistent.""
Taiwan's foreign ministry declined comment.
The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists.
The Republic of China remains Taiwan's formal name and the government says it has no plans to change that given they are already a sovereign, independent state and Beijing has no right to claim Taiwan as its own.

SENSITIVE ISSUE
For several years, Chinese diplomats have pushed the United States to make changes to how it refers to Taiwan's status, which remains the most sensitive area in U.S.-China relations. The unusually direct and renewed push at the leader level has not been reported previously.
The United States severed official relations with the government in Taipei in 1979 but is bound by law to provide democratically governed Taiwan with the means to defend itself. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

It was not clear why Xi chose to raise the issue with Biden, but he has made opposition to Taiwan independence a focus of his time in office and China's military has significantly ramped up its activities around the island in recent years.
The Biden administration regards the proposed language change as a non-starter.
Taiwan was briefed on the recent overtures at a high level by Washington, said one of the sources.

Leaders in Beijing ""would love it if Joe Biden said very different things about Taiwan than he says, no doubt,"" said one senior Biden administration official, adding that Biden would stick with the standard U.S. formulation for talking about Taiwan independence.
During his time in office, Biden has upset the Chinese government with comments that appeared to suggest the United States would defend the island if it were attacked, a deviation from a long-held U.S. position of ""strategic ambiguity.""
A CHANGE THAT WOULD REVERBERATE
A change by the U.S. to say that it opposes Taiwanese independence would reverberate through the trade-rich Asia Pacific and with U.S. partners, competitors and adversaries alike.
Officials from two governments in the region told Reuters they would interpret any such change in wording as a change in U.S. policy toward less support for Taipei's defense and diplomatic aspirations at a time when Beijing has ramped up military pressure.
China has over the past five years staged almost daily military activities around Taiwan. Earlier this month, Beijing held a day of war games using what Taiwan said was a record 153 military aircraft as part of drills simulating blockading ports and assaulting maritime and ground targets.
Any switch in language could also be seen signaling a shift in U.S. policy from supporting the resolution of Taiwan's future through peaceful talks to one suggesting the United States stands against Taiwanese aspirations regardless of the circumstances at play.
Opinion polls in Taiwan show most people support maintaining the status quo, neither seeking to join with China nor establishing a new state.
In 2022, the State Department changed its website on Taiwan, removing wording both on not supporting Taiwan independence and on acknowledging Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China, which angered the Chinese. It later restored the language on not supporting independence for the island.
The two leaders are expected to speak again before Biden's term in office ends in January, talks that may come by phone or on the sidelines of next month's G20 summit in Brazil or APEC summit in Peru. APEC is one of few international forums where both Taiwan and China take part.
The Democratic president will hand over the tense Taiwan issue to his successor, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican former President Donald Trump, following the Nov. 5 election.

That is more than any other pro-Trump super PAC focused on turning out voters. The Trump campaign is broadly reliant on outside groups for canvassing voters, meaning the super PAC founded by Musk - the world's richest man - plays an outsized role in the razor-thin election between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.
Musk, the CEO of electric car manufacturer Tesla, was the sole donor to the group in that period.

Musk's donations to America PAC propel him into the exclusive club of Republican mega donors, a list that also includes banking heir Timothy Mellon and casino billionaire Miriam Adelson.

However, Reuters reported earlier this month that Musk has secretly funded a conservative political group for years, well before his public embrace of Trump.
America PAC declined to comment on the Musk donations. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
America PAC is focused on encouraging Americans who like Trump but don't always vote to cast ballots this cycle, a high-risk, labor-intensive strategy by the Trump campaign.
The group, which started its work later in the election than other PACs, has encountered some problems with hiring and its contractors. Since July, it has fired two major contractors it has hired to knock on doors.
It has also struggled to hire door knockers in several battleground states in part because by the time the PAC became operational many other canvassing groups had already staffed up, a half-dozen sources briefed on the issues told Reuters.
The group had around $4 million left on hand by the end of September, the filings show.
Separate filings earlier on Tuesday showed that Miriam Adelson, the casino magnate, donated $95 million to another pro-Trump super PAC, Preserve America PAC, in the same period.

Trump victory heightens risks for BOJ as yen renews slide,"TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - A dollar rally triggered by Republican Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election could heighten pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates as soon as December to prevent the yen from sliding back toward three-decade lows.
Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election unleashed sharp dollar gains, as expectations of tax cuts and tariffs on imports drove optimism about economic growth while fueling worries about inflation.

U.S. stocks fell across the board Monday with the S&P 500 snapping its longest streak of gains in 20 years.




The greenback's strength briefly pushed the yen to a three-month low of 154.71 on Thursday, well off a high of 140.62 hit in mid-September.
While a weak yen gives exports a boost, it has become a headache for Japanese policymakers by pushing up fuel and food import costs and in turn hurting consumption.
Rising inflation was widely seen as one of the factors behind the massive voter swing against the ruling coalition at last month's general election.
Japan's top currency diplomat Atsushi Mimura escalated his warning against sharp yen falls on Thursday, saying authorities were ready to act against ""excessive"" currency moves.

One nightmare scenario for policymakers would be a renewed plunge in the yen towards the three-decade trough near 162 to the dollar hit in July - a move that prodded the BOJ to raise interest rates to 0.25% on July 31.
Back then, the tumbling yen led to calls from ruling party lawmakers for the BOJ to hike rates, or send clearer signs of its intention to push up borrowing costs.
Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stunned markets on Oct. 2 by saying the economy was not ready for further rate hikes, though he later toned down his message to say he would not intervene in BOJ policy.

""Politicians don't want a weak yen, so even those who have urged the BOJ to be cautious about raising rates could nod to hikes if yen falls accelerate,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute. ""In that sense, the weak yen could prod the BOJ into steady rate hikes.""
HAND-IN-HAND

While many analysts expect the BOJ to hike rates again by March, they are divided on whether it would act in December - or wait until January or March to gauge more data.
The BOJ kept interest rates steady last month but removed language warning of the need to focus on external risks, leaving open the chance of a near-term hike.

The Chart depicts the policy rate and core inflation numbers for Japan.
Renewed yen falls may heighten the chance of the BOJ acting in December, given the BOJ's sensitivity to the currency's weakness that pushes up import costs, analysts say.

Expectations of a near-term rate hike by the BOJ, coupled with rising U.S. Treasury yields, pushed the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield above 1% for the first time in more than three months on Thursday.
""The BOJ hasn't said so clearly but its rate hike in July was likely driven in part by its concern over excessive yen falls,"" said Shinichiro Kobayashi, principal economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting.
""If the yen heads toward 160 to the dollar again, the chance of a rate hike by year-end will increase,"" he said.
Tomoyuki Ota, chief economist at Mizuho Research & Technologies, also sees 160-to-the-dollar as authorities' line in the sand that heightens the chance of a BOJ rate hike - and currency intervention by the government to prop up the yen.
In the previous battle with yen falls, the government and the BOJ appeared to work hand-in-hand.
Japanese authorities spent 5.53 trillion yen ($35.8 billion) intervening in the foreign exchange market in July to pull the yen off 38-year lows near 162 to the dollar. That month, the BOJ hiked rates and stressed its resolve to keep pushing up borrowing costs.
BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's hawkish hints of near-term rate hikes at last month's policy meeting pushed the dollar down toward 150 yen.
""There's no doubt the market's direction is towards a weaker yen. If yen falls accelerate, the chance of a December rate hike will increase,"" said Ota of Mizuho Research. ""The government and the BOJ will likely act swiftly including through currency intervention.""

In addition to the lithium and boron deposits, Rhyolite Ridge is home to the Tiehm's buckwheat flower, which is found nowhere else on the planet and was declared an endangered species in 2022.
The Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and some other conservation groups thus oppose ioneer's project, saying it would push the flower to the brink of extinction.
After the permit was announced on Thursday, the CBD said it plans to sue the federal government to block the project.
""By greenlighting this mine, the Bureau of Land Management is abandoning its duty to protect endangered species like Tiehm's buckwheat and it's making a mockery of the Endangered Species Act,"" said the CBD's Patrick Donnelly.
The Interior Department's Daniel-Davis declined to comment on the potential litigation, but noted the changes made to the mine's operating plan as a result of the permit review process, including new design plans and propagation efforts that included construction of a greenhouse. Department officials also released an opinion stating their belief that the mine would not harm the flower.
""We have run a transparent process,"" said Daniel-Davis. ""The company was willing to reconfigure its entire project to take into account Tiehm's buckwheat.""

"Japan PM Ishiba seeks meeting with Trump this month, following Abe example","TOKYO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba hopes to meet U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the United States this month, four sources said, in an attempt to emulate then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's close ties during Trump's first term.
The U.S. is Japan's most important economic and security partner, while Tokyo is a key Washington ally in Asia, providing bases that allow it to keep a large military presence on China's doorstep.

In Congo, the M23 rebels now face a mundane but daunting new task, governing.




Ishiba told reporters he had held a five-minute phone call with Trump on Thursday morning Japan time and that they agreed to meet as soon as possible.
""I felt that he was very friendly. So from now on, I have the impression that we can talk frankly,"" he said.
Three of the people familiar with the planning, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Japan was aiming to arrange a meeting between Ishiba and Trump just after a Nov. 18-19 summit of the Group of 20 large economies in Brazil. The fourth source said Japan was aiming to arrange the stopover ""around"" the G20 meeting.

Trump's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ishiba wants to follow the example of Abe, the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after his 2016 election. Abe, who was assassinated in 2022, held the hastily arranged meeting at Trump Tower in New York during a stopover just over a week after that election.
Abe forged a close personal relationship with Trump, including hours on the golf course, which helped defuse several contentious issues between the allies, including defence spending and trade.

Ahead of Tuesday's U.S. election, Japanese officials had been stepping up efforts to rekindle relations with people close to Trump, fearing he might again hit Japan with protectionist trade measures such as tariffs on steel, and revive demands for Tokyo to pay more toward the cost of stationing U.S. forces in the country if he returned to office.
Trump has said a decades-old bilateral security treaty is unfair because it commits the United States to defend Japan but does not put similar obligations on Tokyo.

""If Trump says something like Japan is not pulling its weight in the alliance and in dealing with not just China but also North Korea, then you could see a movement toward changing that alliance,"" said Derek Grossman, senior defence analyst at RAND.
Asked about the troop costs on Thursday, Ishiba said he and Trump did not discuss it in their call. ""Rather than focus on monetary amounts, we would like to vigorously discuss the strengthening of the Japan-U.S. alliance from various perspectives,"" he said.

Former U.S. official Michael Green said Trump ""approaches every problem beginning with the question of what is in it for him. That makes allies nervous"".
People around Trump, such as William Hagerty, ambassador to Japan during his first term and now a U.S. senator from Tennessee, could play a pivotal role in managing the Japan-U.S. alliance, said Green, who heads the U.S. Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.
But unlike Abe, who led a stable administration as Japan's longest-serving prime minister, Ishiba heads a coalition that lost its parliamentary majority in an election late last month.
""Given the instability in Tokyo right now, I am not sure Ishiba enjoys these same things that enabled Abe to succeed,"" said Kevin Maher, a consultant who previously headed the U.S. State Department's Office of Japan Affairs. ""He was the right person at the right time.""

In the final weeks before the Nov. 5 election, Trump is increasingly resorting to darker and more violent language about illegal immigration, an issue that opinion polls show resonates with many voters, especially Republicans.

Harris led Trump by eight percentage points - 47% to 39% - among Hispanic voters in Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7. Harris held her own Latino town hall last week in Nevada, a battleground state with a significant Hispanic population.
TRUMP SIDESTEPS QUESTIONS
At the town hall, Trump sidestepped other questions, including on immigration.
One town hall participant, a Mexican-born California farm worker who spoke of picking strawberries and broccoli for years, asked who would do hard farm labor if Trump goes through with his plans to deport millions of people who are in the United States illegally, and how that would impact food prices.
Trump did not answer directly and instead claimed African Americans and Hispanic Americans were losing their jobs because of illegal immigration. He also repeated baseless claims that Latin American countries were emptying out mental institutions and jails to send people to the United States.
Trump has previously used dehumanizing terminology to describe immigrants in the U.S. illegally, calling them ""animals"" when talking about alleged criminal acts, and saying they are ""poisoning the blood of our country,"" a phrase that has drawn criticism as xenophobic and echoing Nazi rhetoric.
Another town hall participant, a Florida-based Republican, said he wanted to give Trump a chance to ""win back his vote"" given his concerns over the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and former Trump administration officials turning against the former president.
Thousands of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in Washington D.C. that day in a bid to stop formal certification of his election defeat, causing millions of dollars in damage. Four people died on the day of the attack, and one Capitol Police officer who fought against the rioters died the next day.

"US fiscal health risks increase after Trump election, says Moody's","NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. fiscal health is at higher risk after the election of Republican Donald Trump as the next U.S. president and given the likely composition of Congress, said rating agency Moody's.
U.S. budget deficits and government debt levels were largely projected to surge under either candidate in the Nov. 5 election, according to several estimates, although Democrat Kamala Harris was expected to add less debt than Trump.

U.S. stocks fell across the board Monday with the S&P 500 snapping its longest streak of gains in 20 years.




Trump's victory has contributed to a selloff in government bonds earlier this week as key elements of his economic plans such as tax cuts and tariffs are expected to lead to faster growth as well as higher inflation and wider budget deficits.
As of Friday, Trump's Republicans appeared set to possibly win control of both chambers of Congress, a scenario that could allow for a faster implementation of new policies.
""In the absence of policy measures to help limit fiscal deficits, the federal government's deteriorating fiscal strength will increasingly weigh on the US sovereign credit profile,"" Moody's said in a Nov. 7 note.
""Given the fiscal policies Trump promised while campaigning, and the high likelihood of their passage because of the changing composition of Congress, the risks to US fiscal strength have increased,"" it added.

Moody's remains the last of the three major rating agencies to maintain a top rating for the U.S. government.
It lowered the outlook on its triple-A U.S. credit rating to ""negative"" from ""stable"" in November last year, and it typically ""resolves"" an outlook, meaning in case of a negative outlook it either brings it back to stable or goes ahead with a rating downgrade, within 18 to 24 months.

Japan's premier Shigeru Ishiba supports normalising monetary policy to boost the yen and bank profits. But his recent unpopularity suggests Japan is heading for a coalition government, and some opposition parties want stimulus to continue.

Yoon and Trump also shared concerns over North Korea's deployment of troops to Russia in its war against Ukraine and its continued military provocations such as ballistic missile launches, and agreed to try to meet in person soon, Deputy National Security Adviser Kim told reporters.
Yoon will need to find a way to use their personal friendship to advance Seoul's interests, said Duyeon Kim of the Center for a New American Security.
""This might be the only way to avert devastating consequences and surprises in the alliance relationship - including South Korean questions about Washington's defense commitment - that we currently assume would happen based on Trump's harsh rhetoric against allies and transactional style,"" she said.
Yoon has pushed for closer security ties with Washington and for greater three-way cooperation together with Japan.
Yoon told Trump the success of three-way cooperation between South Korea, Japan and the United States was due in part to the foundation laid by Trump's first presidency.
Trump has accused South Korea, a key Asian ally, of getting a ""free-ride"" on U.S. military power and demanded it pay far more of the cost of keeping American troops in the country to counter the threat of aggression by North Korea.

Later on Thursday at a news conference, Yoon pledged to strengthen the alliance spanning economic and technological cooperation on the global stage.

Putin said on Sept. 12 that Western approval for such a step would mean ""the direct involvement of NATO countries, the United States and European countries in the war in Ukraine"" because NATO military infrastructure and personnel would have to be involved in the targeting and firing of the missiles.
The Kremlin said that it sensed European powers were nervous about Trump's election, but that they were still ""pumping weapons into Ukraine in order to continue this war to the end.""

Peskov was asked about reports that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron wanted to convince U.S. President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to fire Storm Shadow missiles deep into Russia.
""Nothing can be ruled out,"" Peskov said, adding that European leaders still wanted to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia.
""We, in turn, will continue the SMO (special military operation) until we achieve all our goals,"" Peskov said. ""The dynamic of the SMO is well understood by the military.

Trump backers - including some who could enter his second administration - anticipate the Republican president-elect will call on everyone from the U.S. military to diplomats overseas to turn his campaign promise of mass deportations into a reality. The effort would include cooperation with Republican-led states and use federal funding as leverage against resistant jurisdictions.
Trump recaptured the White House vowing a vast immigration crackdown. The centerpiece of his reelection bid was a promise to deport record numbers of immigrants, an operation Trump’s running mate JD Vance estimated could remove 1 million people per year.

Immigrant advocates warn that Trump’s deportation effort would be costly, divisive and inhumane, leading to family separations and devastating communities. Edison Research exit polls showed 39% of voters said most immigrants in the U.S. illegally should be deported while 56% said they should be allowed to apply for legal status.
Trump struggled to ramp up deportations during his 2017-2021 presidency. When counting both immigration removals and faster “returns” to Mexico by U.S. border officials, Biden deported more immigrants in fiscal year 2023 than any Trump year, according to government data.

But a deportation operation targeting millions would require many more officers, detention beds and immigration court judges. American Immigration Council, an immigrant advocacy group, estimated the cost of deporting 13 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally as $968 billion over a little more than a decade.
Tom Homan, a former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) expected to join the new administration, said in a late October interview that the scale of the deportations would hinge on potential officers and detention space.

“It all depends on what the budget is,” he said.
While the incoming Trump administration could benefit from experience gained during his first term, it could again encounter resistance from ideologically opposed government employees, including officers that screen migrants for asylum.
The American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant advocacy groups have been preparing for court battles if Trump again tests the bounds of his legal authority.

Lee Gelernt, an ACLU attorney who led the fight against Trump’s contentious family separation policy, said more than 15 lawyers focused on immigration with the organization’s national office spent the year readying for the possibility of a Trump return.
“We definitely need to be coordinated and have more resources, because I think they will come in much more prepared,” Gelernt said.
The State Department in particular could be one place where Trump acts more aggressively than during his first term, several Trump backers said.
A key factor will be whether other countries will accept their citizens, an issue Trump faced with limited success during his first term. The Trump administration also struggled at times to convince other nations in the region - including Mexico - to take steps to stop migrants from moving toward the U.S.-Mexico border.
Ken Cuccinelli, former acting deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Trump, said the State Department was a “roadblock” for immigration enforcement and that aggressive appointees will be key.
Christopher Landau, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 2019-2021, recently said he was frustrated with the reluctance of some U.S. diplomats to tackle immigration enforcement.
""Nobody really thought that was their problem,” Landau said in an October panel discussion by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restricting immigration.
About half of ICE’s 21,000 employees are part of its Homeland Security Investigations unit, which focuses on transnational crime such as drug smuggling and child exploitation rather than immigration enforcement. Several Trump allies said the unit would need to spend more time on immigration.
HSI has distanced itself from ICE’s immigration work in recent years, saying fear of deportation made it harder for its investigators to build trust in immigrant communities.
Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's first-term immigration agenda, said in 2023 that National Guard troops from cooperative states could potentially be deployed to resistant states to assist with deportations, which would likely trigger legal battles.
Trump plans to use a 1798 wartime statute known as the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged gang members, an action that would almost certainly be challenged in court.
The law has been used three times, according to the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice: the War of 1812, World War One, and World War Two, when it was employed to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent.
The Brennan Center and others have called on Congress to repeal the law.
""Many fear that a second Trump administration would seek to use this law to justify indefinite detention and remove people from the country swiftly and without judicial review,"" Naureen Shah, the ACLU's deputy director of government affairs, wrote in late October.
George Fishman, a former DHS official under Trump, said the Trump administration would need to prove the immigrants were sent by a foreign government.
“I worry a little about overpromising,” Fishman said.

Justices Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, who turns 70 a week after Trump is due to be inaugurated on Jan. 20, all were appointed by Republican presidents to their lifetime posts on the court.

Under the U.S. Constitution, a president nominates members of the federal judiciary who must then be confirmed by the Senate. Senate rules require only a simple majority for confirming a justice.
Trump defeated Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's U.S. election while Republicans seized control of the Senate from the Democrats.
He came into the presidency in 2017 with the court at a 4-4 ideological deadlock following the 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Trump was able to appoint three conservative justices - Neil Gorsuch in 2017, Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 and Amy Coney Barrett in 2020 - and forge the current 6-3 ideological breakdown.

Since Barrett replaced the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court has moved American law to the right, with rulings rolling back abortion rights, widening gun rights, rejecting race-conscious collegiate admissions policies and constraining the power of federal regulatory agencies.
LIBERALS ON THE SIDELINES
During his presidency, Biden appointed a single justice - Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022 - but her addition did not change the court's ideological composition because her predecessor Stephen Breyer was a fellow liberal.

In recent years, the court's three liberal justices have often been relegated to a dissenting minority in major rulings. With its current ideological breakdown, the liberals need to be joined by at least two conservative colleagues to be in the majority in any ruling.
University of Illinois Chicago law professor Steve Schwinn said retirement decisions by Thomas, Alito and Roberts likely would be driven by whether they see their judicial legacies as complete or believe that more remains to be done.

""Thomas has already solidified his legacy, and I imagine he'd be happy with a replacement continuing it,"" Schwinn said. ""I'm less sure about Alito, and less sure still about Roberts. They may feel like they still have work to do, and that Trump's presidency will embolden them to do it.""
Harvard Law School professor Mark Tushnet said the retirement of any of those three likely would prompt Trump to appoint a younger judge with a conservative track record who is committed to a judicial philosophy called originalism under which the Constitution and statutes are interpreted as written in accordance with their original meaning.
""In the short run, that's likely to have relatively little effect, with one conservative originalist replacing another,"" Tushnet said.

At the time of their confirmation, Gorsuch was 49, Kavanaugh 53 and Barrett 48, meaning they could serve for decades.
Senator Chuck Grassley may be poised to return as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which vets judicial nominations, when Republicans take control of the chamber.
A spokesperson for Grassley said on Wednesday that the senator ""looks forward to working with President Trump to confirm highly qualified, constitutionally sound judges to the federal judiciary.""
Trump and Senate Republicans not only have the opportunity to confirm new Supreme Court justices but also continue their efforts to reshape the rest of the federal judiciary with conservative appointees. Trump won confirmation of 234 judicial nominees in his first four years in office, the second most appointments by any president in a single term.
SOTOMAYOR'S DECISION
Sotomayor has faced calls from some on the political left to retire since 2022, when Democrats won control of the Senate that they are set to relinquish in January. Sotomayor has given no indication that she is considering it.
""There's no realistic possibility that Justice Sotomayor will retire immediately and have a replacement confirmed before Jan. 20,"" Tushnet said. ""I suppose that some hard-line progressive advocacy groups might propose that, but she won't do it, and the Democratic majority in the Senate wouldn't go along, anyway.""
Some on the left had urged Ginsburg to retire during Democrat Barack Obama's 2009-2017 presidency to ensure that a Republican president did not get a chance to replace the liberal icon with a conservative, which ultimately happened when she died in 2020 at age 87.
""I think there will be calls for Justice Sotomayor to step down to allow for a quick confirmation of a successor while President Biden is still in office, but I would be surprised if those succeeded,"" Hans said.
""The Democrats have not had great success in facilitating strategic retirements of justices they confirmed, with Justice Ginsburg as the most prominent example. If Justice Sotomayor were inclined to have stepped down strategically I would have expected her to do so long before now,"" Hans added.

Voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States - despite Trump's false claim, supported by a majority of Republicans in Congress, that the 2020 election was stolen.
U.S. election security officials have said the 2020 election was “the most secure in American history.” A months-long analysis by the Associated Press found fewer than 475 cases of potential voter fraud in the six battleground states challenged by Trump.

With less than two weeks to go until the Nov. 5 election, officials in Lee County in the battleground state of North Carolina told Reuters they are concerned that training sessions like Womack's, with its call for aggressive scrutiny of the voting process, could lead to disruptions at the polls. The Lee County officials say they are adopting new safeguards to prevent poll workers from feeling intimidated.

Womack said that election officials should welcome his North Carolina Election Integrity Team as additional eyes and ears to ensure a fair election. NCEIT has close links to the Republican Party.
Reuters observed an Oct. 16 NCEIT training session and obtained previously unreported transcripts of NCEIT planning calls, which raised the prospect of noncitizen voting.
Reuters also spoke to 10 election officials, former election officials and voter rights advocates who expressed concerns that some poll watchers could disrupt, delay and undermine confidence in the election, and potentially lay the groundwork to overturn the result if Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris wins.

""The playbook seems to be to cast doubt, sow chaos at every possible opportunity, so that if you lose you then have laid the foundation in the minds of your followers and supporters to justify additional action,"" said Tammy Patrick, a former election official who now works at the National Association of Election Administrators, a nonpartisan group of state election directors.
HOW TO SPOT AN 'ILLEGAL'
Poll watchers, who monitor the casting and counting of ballots at polling stations, have been a feature of the American electoral system for decades.
The Democratic Party plans to field its own observers at polling places, including those in Lee County. The Democratic National Committee and the Harris campaign said they are mobilizing thousands of volunteers in voter protection teams across key states, but declined to give further details.
Despite its extreme rarity, Trump and his fellow Republicans have made allegations of noncitizen voting a key part of preparations for legal challenges if Trump loses on Nov. 5.
""Non citizen Illegal Migrants are getting the right to vote, being pushed by crooked Democrat Politicians,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform in July.
NCEIT addressed noncitizen voting in two planning calls, according to the transcripts obtained by Reuters. In July, a participant raised the subject of how to spot an ""illegal"" and suggested that a person who can't speak English probably doesn't have the right to vote.
One participant in an NCEIT planning call in May said she makes signs for polling locations in different languages, including in ""African,"" stating only U.S. citizens can vote. She called her signs ""psyop,"" shorthand for psychological operations aimed at influencing people's behavior.
Womack said that he doesn't recall that conversation and does not agree with the assertion. ""These live calls are conversations and we get lots of inquiries,"" he said. He added that NCEIT strives to educate and train participants in accordance with the law, and sometimes has to correct invalid statements and assertions on the calls.
But he said that NCEIT's “antenna are up about the influx of Hispanics, and they're accidentally being registered to vote.”
Patrick Gannon, public information director for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said there was no evidence of noncitizens trying to affect the election in any way.
NCEIT would challenge any voter it believed was ineligible, Womack said. He also told trainees to be polite and said that NCEIT does not ""condone voter suppression or intimidation of any kind.""

Some voter rights advocates said the training could lead to unfair targeting of Black or Latino voters.
""We're concerned that rhetoric about noncitizens voting will be used to say there was some sort of irregularity and try to prevent the election results from being certified,"" said Katelin Kaiser, policy director at watchdog group Democracy North Carolina.
WATCHING THE WATCHERS
Womack does not accept the evidence that election fraud is very rare. While he said he does not use the word ""stolen"" to describe the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden, he insists the election was ""manipulated by Big Tech, Big Government, and Big Media.""
“The vast majority of the operations seeking to shape the election, or I should say, not shape, to exploit vulnerabilities in the law and to commit fraud in the election are coming from the left,” Womack told Reuters in an interview. “There's no doubt about it,” he added.
NCEIT is affiliated to the Election Integrity Network, an organization run by Cleta Mitchell, an attorney who played a key role in trying to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss. In 2020, Mitchell was on the call when Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse Biden's victory in the state.
Christina Norton, the director of the Republican Party’s election integrity unit, joins a weekly Friday morning call hosted by Mitchell’s EIN group, according to Womack, who also attends.
Mitchell and Norton did not respond to Reuters when asked for comment.
The Republican National Committee says it has trained tens of thousands of volunteer poll watchers, instructing them to call an RNC hotline to report suspected irregularities. RNC poll watchers who do not act within the law will be dismissed, the party says on its website.
An official familiar with the operations of the RNC's Election Integrity Unit, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the RNC has no relationship with groups such as NCEIT that train poll watchers. The official said RNC poll watcher efforts are independent from those groups.
BLURRED LINES
In Lee County, which Trump won comfortably in 2020 and 2016, the lines are blurred. Womack is himself the Republican Party chair. He said NCEIT sends its list of poll watchers to both parties for possible inclusion in their efforts.
""To me, it seems like they're trying to gather data that they could put together to then create doubt in the election,"" said Lee County Elections board Chairwoman Susan Feindel, a Democrat. ""All I want is to have a free and fair election and to be left alone so that we can do our jobs.""
Lee County election officials say they have taken precautions to guard against what they see as overly aggressive behavior by some poll observers who have been trained by NCEIT.
After state legislation last year allowed observers to move more freely around polling stations, Lee County officials said they ordered curtains for the booths. They also purchased screen protectors to cover voting machines and privacy sleeves to cover ballots.
In the 2022 midterm congressional elections, the North Carolina election board registered 21 incidents regarding poll watchers, including 12 of voter intimidation, eight of election official intimidation and one of voter interference. Their records do not specify who trained those poll watchers.
In the primaries earlier that year, Womack followed an election worker who was transporting ballot boxes to the board of elections office, according to an incident report reviewed by Reuters.
Womack was not charged with wrongdoing. He told Reuters he had wanted to ensure that the ballots were delivered safely to the board of elections office. He does not view his actions as intimidation.
Since then, Lee County Elections Director Jane Rae Fawcett has asked local police to be on stand-by at the end of polling, in case election officials need additional security as they transport ballots.
The concerns about overly aggressive poll watchers are not limited to North Carolina.
""My main concern is voter intimidation by poll watchers, as well as intimidating election workers and getting into their faces, generally slowing them down and creating disruptions,"" said Andrew Garber, a lawyer and elections expert with New York University's non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice.

The President-elect's picks are likely to further dilute the contentious Basel III endgame proposal aimed at requiring big lenders to hold more capital to safeguard against soured loans.
In the Kenyan village of Kamathatha, farmer-turned-seed advocate Martha Njenga is teaching fellow villagers traditional seed preservation methods – empowering them to save and replant seeds season after season.




While banks have already won major concessions on that proposal which they say will crimp lending and hurt the economy, the latest draft would still increase capital requirements by around 9% for the largest lenders, according to a top Fed official.
""The Basel endgame rule could be completely dead,"" said Gene Ludwig, a former top bank regulator who advises financial institutions as CEO of Ludwig Advisors.

The regulatory shift could bring some relief to investors after a year in which some bank stocks were weighed down by concerns over deteriorating loans.
First unveiled months after the collapse of three regional lenders last year, the Basel proposal faced intense pushback and an unprecedented lobbying campaign from big banks, which argued the rules would erode their competitive edge.
The Federal Reserve agreed to water down the proposal in September, when Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said the regulator would overhaul and re-issue the rules later.

Other planned rules requiring banks to hold more debt, as well as changes to liquidity regulations, may also be in doubt.

REGULATOR TURNOVER
As Trump installs new regulators at key agencies, his picks could have an immediate and seismic effect on a banking industry more used to a slower pace of change, according to a financial technology executive who declined to be identified discussing the personnel changes.
""This is like an earthquake for bank M&amp;A and bank regulatory policy,"" said Ed Mills, an analyst at Raymond James, who expected bank deals to be announced within weeks.

The aggressive financial regulators of the Biden era, including Gary Gensler at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Lina Khan of the Federal Trade Commission and Rohit Chopra at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are also likely to be replaced by more business-friendly agency heads.
But Meg Tahyar, head of the financial institutions group at law firm Davis Polk, tempered expectations for a radical change.
""There will be changes of personnel at the top level and there will be more M&amp;A, but the intensity of supervision and the focus on junk fees is unlikely to change much,"" she said.

Trump's Texas border gains highlight inroads in former Democratic stronghold,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - The United States' swing toward President-elect Donald Trump in last week's election was pronounced along its border with Mexico, particularly in southern Texas, where Republicans have gained a foothold in traditionally Democratic-voting counties.
Across border counties where nearly all of the ballots have been counted, the president-elect's share of the vote rose almost 10 percentage points from four years ago and was about 20 percentage points higher than in his first presidential campaign in 2016.

Republicans' successes along the southern border with Mexico, where many voters are Hispanic, reflect the party's gains with such voters across the country. It also reflects a focus on immigration, which a Reuters/Ipsos poll last week showed to be the top issue Americans want Trump to tackle in his first 100 days.
Nationally, counties where 40% or more of the citizen voting-age population is Hispanic all moved toward Trump, despite expectations from Democrats that his promises of mass deportation might alienate the demographic.

In Cameron County, Texas, which is roughly 90% Hispanic and home to border city Brownsville, Trump won by more than 5 points, a dramatic reversal from the Democratic ticket's nearly 10-point advantage in 2020 and a lead of over 30 points in 2016.
The county is part of Texas's 27th state Senate district, which Republicans flipped this month after redistricting made it more competitive.
The district is ""ground zero for the border crisis,"" said Adam Hinojosa, the district's state senator-elect, who, according to the Texas Tribune, will be the first Republican to represent any part of the Rio Grande Valley in the state Senate in 150 years.

U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, one of Texas' longest-serving Democrats in Congress - who won reelection in his southern Texas district by thinner margins than normal but who outperformed Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris - said the Biden administration did not listen to his warnings at the beginning of President Joe Biden's administration about rising unauthorized border crossings.
Cuellar said Biden's broad asylum ban in June was effective but was ""just too late"" to change voters' perceptions about the border before the Nov. 5 election.

Missteps from national Democrats were echoed at the state level, Cuellar said.
""Republicans were pumping a large amount of money into South Texas. ... And Democrats, the state party, with all due respect, didn't spend any money down there. They put the money into large urban areas.""
The Texas Democratic Party did not respond to a request for an interview with the party's chairman, Gilberto Hinojosa, who after the election announced his resignation effective in March.

In a statement announcing his resignation, Hinojosa said the party during his leadership had created ""significant and durable gains in our now-Democrat-led big urban counties and cities, as well as in the suburban outer rings.""
REPUBLICAN GROUND GAME
Republicans' gains in border countries are ""not something that happened overnight,"" said Joshua Blank, who manages polling and research at the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Politics Project.
""Republicans have been making concerted efforts, especially in the Rio Grande Valley, over the last three to five election cycles to try to identify more voters in these regions,"" said Blank.
One person leading these efforts was Wayne Hamilton, a longtime Republican political operative in Texas. Hamilton managed Texas Governor Greg Abbott's winning campaign in 2014, which drew attention after Abbott's margin of victory broke 20 points.
Hamilton said Abbott tasked him in 2016 to drive turnout in southern Texas. His first task was recruiting candidates to run in races up and down the ballot.
""We rolled up our sleeves and the first thing we found out is that we didn't have any candidates,"" said Hamilton, who recruited 54 candidates to run in southern Texas in 2018, a number which grew to over 130 this election.
Engaging Hispanic voters has been critical to the party's improved fortunes, said U.S. Representative Monica De La Cruz, who flipped Texas's 15th Congressional District in 2022 to become the first Latina and the first Republican to represent the district.
""We knocked on thousands and thousands of doors,"" De La Cruz said.

HOUSE UP FOR GRABS
Republicans also won several races that could allow them to expand their 220-212 majority in the House, though the final outcome may not be known for days.
They won a Democratic-held district in Pennsylvania that includes Scranton, Democratic President Joe Biden's hometown, and picked up seats from Democrats in North Carolina, where they had redrawn district lines to their advantage, with another victory in Michigan.

Democrats won a Republican-held seat in upstate New York and a seat in Alabama that had been redrawn to comply with a U.S. Supreme Court order to create a Black majority district.
Democrats now need to flip at least seven seats to take control of the 435-seat chamber. But their opportunities to do so were gradually diminishing, as Republican incumbents won competitive reelection races in Colorado, Iowa, New Jersey and Virginia.
In Delaware, voters made history by electing Democrat Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress.
With at least 200 seats safe for each party, the winning side will likely end up with a narrow majority that could make governing difficult. That has been evident in the past two years as Republican infighting has led to failed votes and leadership turmoil and undercut the party's efforts to cut spending and tighten immigration.
Tight races in the heavily Democratic states of New York and California could determine House control, and California typically takes several days to count its ballots.

Trump victory a boost for Brazil's right-wing politics,"BRASILIA, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's electoral victory in the United States has injected new energy into Brazil's hard right and stirred hopes that former President Jair Bolsonaro can mirror his return to power despite legal obstacles to running for office in 2026.
Although analysts say it is a long-shot, Bolsonaro's backers are pushing to get him amnesty after an electoral court ruled him ineligible for public office until 2030 due to his baseless attacks on Brazil's voting system in the last presidential race.

Bolsonaro, an anti-establishment firebrand who was dubbed the ""Trump of the Tropics"" when he was elected in 2018, thanked God for the Republican's victory on Tuesday, which he touted as improving his chances of returning to the presidency.
""Trump's victory will inspire conservatives worldwide and reinforce the movement in Brazil to re-elect Jair Bolsonaro as president in the 2026 elections,"" said Valdemar Costa Neto, head of Bolsonaro's right-wing Liberal Party (PL).

Trump's win could bring increased funding for mobilization and communication efforts by Brazil's far-right movement, according to risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.
""Trumpism and Bolsonarism are closely linked. If Jair Bolsonaro plays his cards right, his inner circle could regain centrality in Brazil's shifting conservative landscape,"" Verisk Maplecroft said in a note to clients.
Bolsonaro was barred from public office for eight years after being convicted by Brazil's top electoral court of abusing power and misusing public media to spread unfounded claims about the country's electronic voting system.

He has been formally accused by federal police of tampering with COVID-19 vaccination cards while in office and of embezzling jewelry gifted by the Saudi government.
Bolsonaro is also being investigated for his alleged role in a coup plot after losing his 2022 re-election bid, when his supporters vandalized government buildings in a riot that recalled the storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump backers.
PL leader Costa Neto is hoping an amnesty bill in Congress affecting some 1,600 people still in jail for the January 8, 2023 uprising in Brasilia will include Bolsonaro, opening the door for him to run again in 2026.
However, political risk consultant Lucas de Aragao said there is no reason to think the judiciary will budge on Bolsonaro's ineligibility.
""A reversal is unlikely, even with Trump's victory,"" he said.

The meeting between Washington and two of its closest Asian allies came as U.S. relations with Beijing are expected to grow more confrontational after Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, given his promises of sharp tariff hikes that could hobble China's economy.

North Korea's deployment of troops to Russia to support Russia's war in Ukraine, as well as North Korea's nuclear weapons program and dimming prospects for a peaceful resolution to a decades-long conflict with South Korea are also raising tensions in Asia.

Getting South Korea and Japan to work together is considered one of the diplomatic achievements of Biden's soon-to-end four-year term as president. The two countries have a long history of mutual acrimony stemming from Japan's harsh 1910-1945 colonial rule of Korea.
Biden sees close ties among the three as a hedge against aggressive steps by China in the region, a view Beijing rejects. Yoon met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, with Ishiba and Biden also set to hold their own one-on-ones with Xi during the APEC summit.

Trump's commitment to the trilateral work has been an open question in the region given the president-elect's ""America First"" approach, suspicion of U.S. financial and military support for traditional allies, and his own diplomatic foray into North Korea during his first four-year term.

TRUMP TARIFF THREAT
Trump has proposed tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% and ending China’s most-favoured-nation trading status, and analysts say the prospect of a trade war has rattled China's leadership.

China sells goods worth more than $400 billion annually to the U.S. and hundreds of billions more in components for products Americans buy from elsewhere.
""Beijing is particularly wary of a potential revival of the trade war under Trump, especially as China currently faces significant internal economic challenges,"" said Zhao.
""China also expects Trump to accelerate the decoupling of technologies and supply chains, a move that could threaten China's economic growth and indirectly impact its social and political stability.""

In response, China is likely to intensify its push for greater technological and economic self-sufficiency, while feeling more pressure to bolster economic ties with countries like Russia, he added.
""Going forward, Beijing would likely be drawing up a list of clear bargains and interest tradeoffs that it could float with Washington, in hope that it can focus on its much needed domestic economic concerns whilst Trump's attention is occupied elsewhere,"" said Brian Wong, assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong who studies grand strategy.
GLOBAL POWER VACUUM
China is likely to shore up ties with the Global South, Europe and Northeast Asian countries in the event of a Trump win, given his ""transactional, isolationist, anti-globalist and anti-multilateral foreign policy"", said Wong.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached a rare rapprochement last month, while Beijing has tentatively reached out to the new Japanese administration this autumn following years of strained relations.
""China expects the second Trump administration to further disengage from international agreements and commitments, creating opportunities for China to expand its influence in emerging power vacuums,"" Zhao added.
Trump has unnerved democratically governed Taiwan by saying it should pay Washington for its defence and that it had taken U.S. semiconductor business.
""The Biden administration applied high-pressure tactics to China on Taiwan, with U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan and even giving weapons to Taiwan ... in a huge break with the former Trump administration's Taiwan policy,"" said Shen Dingli, an international relations scholar in Shanghai.

CHINA
Chinese businesses are waiting to see if Trump makes good on a threat to impose tariffs of 60% or more on imports from China, which could kickstart a fresh trade war reminiscent of the one he waged during his 2017-2021 presidency.
The trade war hit sectors across the board, from manufacturers of vacuum cleaners to machinery, with tariffs imposed on more than $200 billion of goods. The Biden administration has kept most of the tariffs in place.
Several Chinese companies were also hit with export controls by the Trump administration citing national security, such as Huawei Technologies which was barred from purchasing high-end chips, crippling its smartphone business.

For decades, the United States has enforced a trade embargo against the island that complicates Cuba's global financial transactions.

""Trump is already saying he will deport all immigrants and crush us even more with the blockade.""
Cuba's spiraling social and economic crisis came to a head this month when its electrical grid collapsed, blacking out the island for days and sparking scattered protests.
Cuba blamed U.S. sanctions for complicating the purchase of fuel and spare parts for its oil-fired power plants. Critics say mismanagement and an inefficient state-run economy are also to blame.

Whatever the roots of the crisis, the result is a record-breaking migration wave that has drained Cuba of its once youthful workforce - many of whom, in turn, arrive on the U.S. border, a problem for both countries, analysts say.
Upwards of a million people have left the island since 2020, according to Cuban official statistics, nearly a tenth of its population, an exodus with few comparisons outside of wartime.
Fabio Fernandez, a professor of history with the University of Havana, said any new limits on Cuban migration could bring dire consequences.
""If there is no escape valve for migration it could be a problem for Cuba,"" Fernandez said.
BACKBURNER
On the U.S. side, Cuba has been largely absent from campaign policy and rhetoric.
During the 2020 campaign, then-President Trump blasted leftist leaders in Cuba and Venezuela, winning over much of Miami’s large Cuban American community. But this time, Florida is widely seen as more firmly in Trump’s camp, which some experts say is the reason both campaigns have largely left the issue on the backburner.
Trump sanctions on Cuba during his first administration ""ended the disastrous Obama policy that ultimately flowed funds to the repressive Castro regime,"" Republican National Committee spokesperson Anna Kelly told Reuters.
""Under weak Kamala Harris, our adversaries, including Cuba, are emboldened and everyone is less safe. President Trump will fix it starting Nov. 5.”
Kelly did not respond to a question on whether a second Trump administration would restore restrictions on Cuba that Biden had modestly rolled back, including the flow of remittances.
Harris' campaign also suggested she would maintain pressure on Cuba.
“Vice President Harris stands with the people of Cuba as they fight for their rights after decades of repression and economic suffering at the hands of the communist regime,” said Morgan Finkelstein, national security spokesperson for the Harris campaign.
“She will stand up to all authoritarians — including the very leaders that Trump has praised and embraced.”
Finkelstein did not respond to questions about whether Harris, as president, would stick to Biden’s Cuba policy or take a revised approach.

It is very early days, however, and we would expect volatility to remain elevated in the next few trading sessions, as investors position themselves in anticipation of another Trump presidency. This could mean fresh downside in risk assets and another bout of dollar strength, particularly should the Federal Reserve hint to markets at upcoming policy meetings, potentially on Thursday, that the outcome of the election may slow the pace of the Federal Reserve cutting cycle.

“For now, of course, nothing changes. President Biden will remain in the top job until early next year, and we will have to wait until 20th January 2025 for Trump’s inauguration. His rhetoric in the meantime will be closely watched by market participants. Commentary that doubles down on his tariff threats and tax cuts could conceivably exert some additional upward pressure on the greenback, as investors pencil in weaker global growth and a higher terminal Federal Reserve interest rate.”

“These election results will be really bad for fixed income and can unwind a lot of the bullishness in fixed income. Trump keeps openly telling people that he will increase tariffs not just on China but with every trade partner. We’re talking 10% tariffs across all global partners. This is a big deal because this could add 1% to inflation. If you add 1% to next year’s inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts. With higher tariffs, the Fed will not be in a position to cut rates even if the economy is slowing down- and that is a toxic mix for fixed income.

""The initial reaction is not surprising. This was sort of a 50-50. The market is correctly saying we might see a red sweep. Even if it's a narrow Republican majority (in the Senate), somewhere out there there are Republicans that are fiscally conservative.
""You're going to get some version of a repricing (of Treasuries) just by nature of the math. It's just a question of how long does it last. You're seeing the initial damage today.

""Volatility is important here. I suspect we could see a decline in overall volatility.
""We're hesitant to buy or sell bonds. We're looking at that 30-year auction today as a barometer of demand. I'm sitting on my hands and seeing how things play out. Treasuries have had a pretty good sell-off coming into this. Ultimately you're making a bet that there is going to be some fiscal responsibility coming out of the Trump administration.""
DAVID BAHNSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, THE BAHNSEN GROUP, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIF.
""For now, investor sentiment is pro-growth, pro-deregulation, and pro-markets, as seen in the overnight market action. There is also an assumption that M&A activity will pickup and that more tax cuts are coming or the existing ones will be extended. This creates a strong backdrop for stocks.""
""Financials and Energy are the obvious beneficiaries of Trump's victory amid hopes of deregulation and a greater focus on U.S. energy independence. There may even be other sectors that benefit from Trump's victory, such as technology stocks, especially if the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is knocked down a peg. We need to see personnel and cabinet appointments in the week ahead to get firmer ideas around all this, as personnel is policy.""

""Both parties are going to spend no matter what. This Treasury sell-off is overdone. It's kind of a knee-jerk reaction.
""(In terms of Fed policy) none of the presidents have been silent on rates. It's going to be a '94-'95 scenario. They used this term 'recalibrate'. It reminds me of a post-'94-'95 period where the Fed was tweaking back and forth to avoid a recession.
""Trump's win is equally as surprising as in 2016. I know all the votes aren't in, but his current lead in the popular vote is to me the bigger surprise.
""I think we're all watching (the House elections) very closely. It's always a critical component as markets tend to like gridlock. They like it as business continues as usual.

“Inflation might be stickier than maybe would have been without this political landscape, but I don’t see us returning to a post pandemic flare up … It might suggest we take longer or we may not get to the actual Fed’s target of 2%, but … the bias is going to continue to be toward cutting”

ANDREA SCAURI, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, LEMANIK, LUGANO:
""With Trump's victory, you'll get much stronger fiscal policies compared to what might have been under a Democratic administration. This will have repercussions for inflation, and you can see that already with this morning's rise in Treasury yields.""
""So, who benefits from all of this? I think old-economy sectors, like oil, drilling, mechanical, and heavy industry, will benefit. And probably also tech, as the American consumers will have more money in their pockets, they might spend it on new phones, TVs, or invest in the stock market.""
EMMANUEL CAU, HEAD OF EUROPEAN EQUITY STRATEGY, BARCLAYS, LONDON:
""You have renewables, auto sector, some of the tariff stocks and China-exposed names which are lagging, so even though the market is going up, you are seeing some discrimination based on some of the Trump policies.""
""Roughly speaking, you have renewable and tariff trade names underperforming, then you have your U.S. consumer and dollar plays doing better. That seems to be the story now.""
EMMANOUIL KARIMALIS, MACRO RATES STRATEGIST, UBS, LONDON:
“We think that given Trump’s key elements of his agenda - tariffs on China and the rest of the world - the market is just thinking this would obviously have an impact on China, and Europe is a bit more sensitive to China. That would probably have an impact on growth, so European rates (bonds) are rallying.”
“U.S. rates have obviously sold off given expectations of more fiscal loosening in the U.S., and probably slightly higher inflation due to tariffs.”
“The fact that European rates have reacted sharply might be a little bit overdone in my view, because we don’t expect the ECB to shift their expectations quickly.”
DAVID ALLEN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PLATO GLOBAL ALPHA FUND, SYDNEY:
""Markets absolutely crave certainty, if we'd had a long contested result you would have seen price swings to the downside in major markets...Trump's victory was also somewhat priced in at the margins""
""I do think Trump 2.0 will be different from Trump 1.0... I don't think Trump was even expecting to win the first time and was less prepared. This time is different, I expect him to push through a lot of fast major legislation within the first 100 days, so hold onto your hats.""
ROGIER QUAEDVLIEG, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, ABN AMRO RESEARCH, AMSTERDAM
""Given the inflationary expectations associated with Trump’s economic and fiscal policies, we expect U.S. rates to continue rise across the yield curve. We anticipate that the market will further retrace expectations for Fed rate cuts next year due to increased inflation projections, while also pricing in higher term premiums.
""However, our economic analysis suggests that the full implementation of Trump’s policies – especially the tariffs – will eventually weigh heavily on the US economy.""
""Trump’s universal tariffs plan is also expected to have a substantial impact on the already fragile euro zone economy, while the inflationary effects for Europe will be more limited. This could trigger an even more accelerated rate cutting cycle path from the ECB and will likely lead to a greater divergence between the US and European policy rates.""
ANDRZEJ SZCZEPANIAK, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, NOMURA, LONDON:
""In summary: It's bad news for Europe.""
""Trump winning means tariffs which will adversely affect growth in Europe. The European Commission is expected to retaliate like-for-like, which could mean higher inflation in the euro area – or, as manufacturing firms' pricing power is so diminished, as we have been flagging for some time, firms could be forced to absorb these higher costs, which in turn may result in some firms shuttering and unemployment rising, thus weighing more heavily on growth.""
KEN PENG, HEAD OF ASIA INVESTMENT STRATEGY, CITI WEALTH, HONG KONG
""A lot of this is based on investors' view that Trump would cut taxes or at least keep tax rates low. Now that it's likely to be looking like a red sweep - additional cuts are possible.
""Deregulation is another major positive for the economy and markets, particularly for the financial, energy and tech sectors. The negatives are tariffs. That's going to be negative for global growth, you know, particularly in China, Asia (and)Europe... you see inflation expectations rise.
""I think the market is currently still just enjoying the positive aspects of a red sweep, but I think as time passes, you are likely to see the risks ... get priced in.""
NAKA MATSUZAWA, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST, NOMURA, TOKYO:
""I think the market was not yet ready for a 'red sweep'... if the 'red sweep' materialises, 10-year yields for U.S. Treasuries could go up to as high as 4.50% and above. Dollar/yen could go over 155. They're kind of half pricing in that level right now.
""If Trump can pass tax and spending bills first, then he doesn't have to rush for the hardline policies against China, which come rather later. If Congress is controlled by Republicans Trump can prioritise economic stimulus measures.""
RONG REN GOH, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, EASTSPRING INVESTMENTS, SINGAPORE:
""With Trump, market volatility is likely to pick up, so trading-wise, it does open up opportunities. The volatility comes from uncertainty surrounding how he intends to follow through on some of his campaign promises.
""Right now the markets are focusing narrowly on the prospect of tariffs, because it is the easiest lever to pull directly under a presidential executive order, but we've seen between 2016 and 2020 other levers that can be pulled to contain China.
""From this perspective, I think a foreign investor is likely to position more defensively towards China-focused risk.""
WONG KOK HOONG, HEAD OF EQUITY SALES TRADING, MAYBANK, SINGAPORE:
""Carnage in HK/China hasn't really materialised because traders and investors are still awaiting any possible (stimulus) announcements.
""As for the next four years in general, for a start we may need to download Truth Social app.""
GARY NG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, HONG KONG:

'BIG TEST' AFTER U.S. ELECTION
Adam McCarthy, research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko, said that the headline figure of Polymarket bets on the election didn't equate to the amount of money that was currently still at stake because it also included inactive bets on former candidates like Nikki Haley and RFK Jr.
""That $2 billion cumulative headline figure looks impressive and obviously for a brand new platform it is, but that doesn't reflect active markets entirely,"" McCarthy added.

Trading volume on bets for Trump or Harris winning the presidency make up about $1.97 billion of the $3.1 billion in volume on Polymarket's presidential winner contract, the platform's data shows.

"US campaign ends as it began, with voters focused on immigration, abortion","Nov 5 (Reuters) - After months of campaigning, Tuesday’s presidential election may have come down to the two signature issues that defined Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump from the start: abortion rights and immigration.
In more than 65 interviews in recent days, voters returned to those themes in explaining their choice for president. For many, personal experiences - as a parent, neighbor or friend - shaped their views on what was the most important.

While the sample was too small to base any hard conclusions, it provides a snapshot of how Americans may have been thinking in the final days of the campaign.
For Trump backers, the need to stem illegal immigration - a core theme of his presidency - was the No. 1 reason for voting Republican, according to those interviewed. Economic concerns and high inflation were often mentioned as other issues that motivated Trump’s supporters, even though the U.S. economy continues to grow and the jobless rate remains low.

“I know a lot of people that have personally struggled under the Biden administration,” said Justin Newhouse, 23, a self-described conservative from Milwaukee.
For many Harris backers, her vow to protect abortion rights after the U.S. Supreme Court [USN:LUN2QW00Q TEXT:“overturned the landmark 1973 ruling”] that recognized a constitutional right to the procedure was the most compelling reason to vote for the Democratic vice president. The perception that Trump, who has frequently made racist and offensive remarks, was a racist was often top of mind as well.

The interviews were conducted in the battleground states where the campaign is expected to be won or lost: Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin. Here is a taste of what voters had to say about their choice:
‘BORDERS HAVE BEEN CRAZY’
Heather Thomas, a 49-year-old convenience store worker near the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, said the key issue behind her vote for Trump was illegal immigration and what she described as the economic and societal devastation it had brought.

“The open border means the end of our country,” Thomas said. “And with Biden and the other Democrats, the borders have been crazy, just wide open.”
Thomas, who makes $13 an hour, said she believed that Democrats have done little about illegal immigration, even though the Biden administration has taken steps to curb border crossings.
“How is the country supposed to take care of millions of illegal people coming here when we are not even taking care of so many Americans who are out there living on the streets, who are struggling to eat?” Thomas asked.
Thomas said in her daily interactions with poor and homeless people at her store she has seen much suffering.
CHANGE OF HEART
Myesha Parks, who works as a dental hygienist in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, backed Harris primarily because of the candidate’s position on abortion, and because she “was never a fan of Trump.”
Parks is a 27-year-old practicing Baptist who grew up opposed to abortion. But her views began to shift after two friends were raped. “If that ever happened to me, I don’t think I’d be strong enough to carry a child on my own,” she said.
Parks believes Harris, as a woman, is more suited to address an issue such as abortion: “Men shouldn’t be allowed to tell women what to do with their bodies.”
‘I WANT A WALL’
Judy Boyce, a retired flight attendant from Marietta, Georgia, voted for Trump, as she did in 2016 and 2020, citing border security and the economy. She sees the issues as linked.
“We are funding so much for illegal aliens. I’m being politically incorrect, but that’s what they are, they are not Americans,” she said. Boyce, 79, said that money should instead go to U.S. citizens.

“I want a wall and I want illegal immigration down to zero. I want this economy back to when Donald Trump was president.”
‘MY OWN BODY’
Sarah Weigel, a 46-year-old event coordinator from the rural town of Franklin, Pennsylvania, says she is not very engaged politically, but she will cast a ballot this year for Harris to protect abortion rights.
She said the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in 2022 overturning the Roe v. Wade decision that protected abortion rights, pushed her to vote.
“For me, it’s, I guess, being able to make a choice of what I want to do with my own body,” Weigel said. “So if a woman wanted to get an abortion or not she should have that right to make that decision on her own.”
‘TREASON’
Terry Balko, a part-time charitable fundraiser from Marietta, Georgia, voted early for Donald Trump, his choice in the previous two elections.
Over breakfast in a café close to his home, Balko said he wanted “less inflation, a safer country” and to deport illegal immigrants.
Balko got animated when discussing the issue, citing the case of [USN:L2N3G90BJ TEXT:“Laken Riley”], a 22-year-old student who was murdered in February, a case that Trump often refers to in his campaign speeches. The suspect, a Venezuelan in the U.S. illegally, has pleaded not guilty to murder charges.
“Biden and Harris are totally derelict in protecting our citizens,” Balko said. “They should be bought up on a charge of treason.”
FEAR OF BEING TARGETED
Stephanie Lopez Gilmore, 39, who works at a wellness and mental health center in Detroit, said she was voting for Harris to protect women’s reproductive rights. She also looks forward to having a woman of color in the Oval Office.
“Being a woman of color myself, it’s very inspiring to see someone that looks like you and that has maybe some of the same
interests as you that will be leading the country,"" she said.
Lopez Gilmore, who has both Latina and Black ancestry, said
she feared a Trump victory would lead to an increase in the
discrimination she routinely experiences.
STAND AGAINST RACISM
Noel Soto, a 32-year-old truck driver originally from Mexico, said he cast his first ballot as a U.S. citizen for Harris with one clear goal: Taking a stand against racism.
“I don’t like Trump’s side because of its racism. I did it for my Mexican family,” Soto said in Spanish at a Phoenix rodeo organized by Democrats to get out the Latino vote.
Soto said he was concerned by what he felt was more racism around him, especially from Trump supporters. He recounted an episode in which he said a Trump supporter asked him while he was trick-or-treating for Halloween whether he was dressed as “a Latino immigrant.” Soto had dressed as a farmer to pair with his one-year-old son, who went as a cow.

Are election fears causing top US corn and soy customers to stock up early?,"NAPERVILLE, Illinois, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A recent deluge of U.S. corn and soybean export sales has prompted some market-watchers to question whether the demand boost is tied to uncertainties over the outcome of next week's U.S. presidential election.
U.S. grains have been competitive on the global market this year amid bumper 2024 harvests and smaller output from rival suppliers, so healthy demand should be expected.
The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here.
Unfortunately for U.S. exporters, interest from key trade partner China has been lackluster, though they have sold enormous quantities of corn for delivery to top customer Mexico.
U.S. stocks fell across the board Monday with the S&P 500 snapping its longest streak of gains in 20 years.




This is noteworthy since trade with Mexico was targeted under the administration of former President Donald Trump, who is now the Republican candidate for president. Trump has proposed massive tariffs on Mexican vehicle imports as well as 60% tariffs on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on those from all countries.
Trump faces Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in next Tuesday's election.
Trump's threats will not enthuse China, but could Mexican grain importers be front-loading U.S. exports due to fears of a possible trade war? Maybe, though there is no conclusive evidence to suggest this is the case.
However, Mexico depends heavily on U.S. corn, which is probably why it continued importing large volumes of the U.S. grain the last time the two countries got caught in a trade dispute.

MEXICO, USA AND CORN
Trump spent much of his 2017-2021 presidential term working to revamp the previous North American trade pact, resulting in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) which took effect in 2020. But tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and escalation threats were all involved in the process.
Although Mexico prepared to retaliate against all U.S. farm goods under a worst-case scenario, it generally continued at that time to secure and import record volumes of corn from the United States, retaining its overall share of U.S. corn exports.

U.S. corn exports to Mexico by volume and share
U.S. corn exports to Mexico by volume and share
This is largely due to the proximity advantage of U.S. corn as well as its abundance. U.S. corn accounted for more than 85% of Mexico’s corn imports last year.
There were fears a few years ago that Brazil could imminently steal a big portion of Mexican corn business from the United States. While this could pose a legitimate threat, Mexico has yet to account for more than 4% of annual Brazilian corn exports.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
Bolstered by an expanding livestock sector, Mexico is projected to be the world’s top corn importer in 2024-25, with volumes dropping slightly from record 2023-24 levels on a stronger harvest.
Trump earlier this month said he would renegotiate USMCA if elected, which could stir up tensions between the two countries with historically strong trade relations.
In 2022, cars accounted for 8% of the value of all Mexican exports to the United States while corn accounted for 1.6% of the total value of U.S. imports into Mexico. Refined petroleum was the top U.S. import by value at 13.4%.

Behind China, Mexico was the No. 2 destination last year for U.S. bulk agricultural products such as corn and soybeans. That trade exceeded $10 billion in value and accounted for 17% of the annual total.
CHINA
Considering the U.S.-China trade war that began during Trump’s first term, some traders have said that Chinese buyers are shunning U.S. soybeans for January delivery and onward over tariff uncertainties, opting for sometimes-pricier Brazilian offerings.
They are certainly not front-loading. As of mid-October, China’s U.S. soybean bookings for 2024-25 stood at a 16-year-low if excluding the two trade-war years. Only 43% of total U.S. soybean sales so far are explicitly to China, an 18-year, non-trade-war low.
On the flip side, it might have appeared that China was stocking up ahead of the 2020 U.S. election, especially as it burst onto the U.S. corn market mid-year. But China’s domestic corn prices were surging as stockpiles dwindled, and global corn prices that year had dropped to decade-plus lows.
In other words, China’s own interests were likely behind its rampant U.S. corn and soy export bookings in 2020. Additionally, Beijing gained some goodwill by appearing to fulfill the Phase 1 trade agreement it signed with Washington in January 2020.
President Joe Biden maintained Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods and even implemented new ones, so many analysts believe trade policies will remain status-quo should Harris win the election.
Regardless, if the next U.S. president takes tougher measures against Chinese imports, it may not result in direct retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture.
But the move could instead motivate Beijing to further invest in South America and other key agricultural suppliers while phasing out U.S. ones, and the same logic could extend to Mexico or other U.S. trade partners if U.S. policies become a hindrance.

ENDORSEMEHT OF TRUMP
Gabbard, who endorsed Trump for his return to the presidency, advised him ahead of his pre-election debate with Vice President Kamala Harris in September and defended him in the face of what critics called a series of racist and sexist attacks against his Democratic rival.
""President Trump respects women and doesn't feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man,"" she said.

Gabbard consistently opposed U.S. intervention in Syria, even meeting secretly with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in January 2017, who was accused of widespread human rights abuses. The meeting sparked criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress.
In 2019, Gabbard became embroiled in a war of words after 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Gabbard was being ""groomed"" to disrupt the 2020 election as a third-party candidate.
Gabbard sued for defamation, seeking at least $50 million in damages from Clinton for harming her reputation by allegedly suggesting she was a Russian asset. She dropped the suit in May 2020.
This February, when Gabbard's name came up as a possible vice presidential running mate for Trump, she spoke at CPAC and gave a speech portraying Trump as a victim of political persecution.
""It's lunacy and it's the mindset and mentality of dictators. They are waging a multi-front battle and they will stop at nothing until they’re successful,"" she said.

""We here understand we have an opportunity before us to turn the page on the fear and divisiveness that have characterized our politics for a decade because of Donald Trump,"" Harris said. ""Please vote early.""
Obama, who has been campaigning in multiple swing states for Harris, made his case against Trump, arguing the former president thought about no one but himself.
He implied that Trump was acting like a doddering old man and, in a reference to Trump's recent event at a McDonald's, noted that Harris had actually worked at the fast food chain earlier in her life.

""She worked at McDonald's when she was in college to pay her expenses. She didn't pretend to work at McDonald's when it was closed,"" Obama said.
Ahead of Harris' remarks, film director Spike Lee warned a packed crowd at the James R. Hallford Stadium not to be ""bamboozled"" into voting for the Republican nominee.

As Harris spoke, a noticeable number of people who had been sitting for hours began to leave their seats and make their ways to the exits, leaving pockets of empty seats in what was once a packed house.

The rally represented the latest attempt by the Harris campaign to capitalize on the backing of movie and music stars to mobilize voters in the closing days of a tight election race.

TIGHT RACE
Harris' whirlwind campaign started with a big jump in polls after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in late July, but her lead has narrowed in national polls and evaporated in the battleground states that will decide the U.S. election.
Celebrity endorsers add cultural cachet to candidates, and have typically helped campaigns raise money, turn out crowds at rallies and generate excitement on social media.
For both the Harris and Trump campaigns, they are part of the down-to-the-wire blitz to mobilize voters ahead of Election Day on Nov. 5.
Thursday's rally also marked the first time Harris and Obama campaigned together. Harris is slated to appear with Michelle Obama on Saturday in Michigan, one of seven swing states expected to decide the winner. Both Obamas spoke in favor of Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August.
The latest polls in Georgia show Trump with a slight lead, but Harris campaign officials say they remain confident the state, along with its neighbor North Carolina, are still in play.
Biden pulled off a surprise victory in Georgia in 2020, and Democrats won two hard-fought Senate seats there that gave them control of both houses in Congress for the first half of Biden's term.

"In the Market: How Harris, Trump promises could feed market's addiction to the Fed","Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve risks moving beyond its role as a lender of last resort to a prop markets need to function even in normal times, with pressures likely to increase as U.S. presidential candidates look set to add trillions more to deficits.
The latest sign of the Fed's mission creep came on Sept. 30, when typical end of the quarter strains on Treasury markets led to a $2.6 billion drawdown of its funding backstop, called the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), since it was set up in 2021 after a market scare.

The facility, which allows some lenders to borrow against collateral such as Treasuries, was set up to alleviate cash shortfalls in the market, which can lead to sudden spikes in short-term interest rates that threaten financial stability.
But two banking sources who requested anonymity to speak candidly and a market expert told me there was no liquidity problem that day, and indicators of financial stress were below normal levels.

Instead, these people said the drawdown highlighted a potent structural issue: At about $28 trillion, the Treasury market has become too large. Banks typically would facilitate such trades, but now either they don't have enough room on their balance sheets or don't want to because post-2008 crisis regulations made the activity less profitable.
It's a problem that's likely going to get worse. U.S. fiscal deficits are growing. A budget-focused think tank estimated earlier this month that Republican Donald Trump's tax and spending plans would add $7.5 trillion to deficits over 10 years, while Democratic rival Kamala Harris' plans add $3.5 trillion. The estimates have drawn criticism from both campaigns.

Already, the Fed and market participants are floating ideas that would pull the central bank even deeper into markets, ranging from centrally clearing some transactions to broadening who can borrow from it and offering the SRF earlier in the day.
While smooth functioning of Treasury markets is essential to global financial stability, the central bank's growing involvement can have unintended consequences, such crowding out other investors and creating asset bubbles as it happened after COVID-19.

""It's a serious problem,"" said Darrell Duffie, a Stanford University finance professor who is an expert on Treasury markets. ""We have to redesign the financial system and regulations so that the market can digest demands for liquidity, even on stress days, and we're not there.""
The Fed declined to comment.
To be fair, thank goodness for the Fed. The central bank is faced with a series of bad choices, forced into a corner by decisions taken by fiscal authorities.

Viral Acharya, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said the problem was beginning to morph into an emerging-market type of situation ""because deficits are soaring, the borrowing calendar is too aggressive, and there are mismatches - but importantly, frictions - in the private demand and supply for liquidity.""
""Central banks are therefore constantly fighting like three-four fires simultaneously,"" said Acharya, who is now an economics professor at New York University Stern School of Business.
A measure of the level of stress in the financial system was benign at quarter-end, when a Federal Reserve market backstop was used.
A measure of the level of stress in the financial system was benign at quarter-end, when a Federal Reserve market backstop was used.
LENDER OF LAST RESORT
A central bank's role as a lender of last resort was first theorized by the 19th century economist Walter Bagehot, who wrote it was needed to prevent bank panics. The Fed, which was set up in 1913, has intervened several times to serve that function over the decades.
But its presence in the market has grown markedly since the 2008 financial crisis, as its balance sheet expanded and it set up new facilities to support markets. That has corresponded with rapid growth in the Treasury market, which has more than doubled over the past 10 years. Intermediation capacity has not kept up.
The SRF was set up after one such panic moment in September 2019, caused by a sudden spike in interest rates in the repurchase agreement, or repo, market, where institutions borrow short-term funds against Treasuries and other collateral. Over the next few years, the SRF lay dormant, with use limited to banks testing access.
One of the sources said some of the foreign banks withdrew from the market as they tend to do at the end of the quarter to shrink their balance sheets, a process euphemistically called 'window dressing' to reduce capital charges.
MORAL HAZARD
The lack of capacity meant there wasn't enough funding available on Sept. 30 when many market participants tried to borrow. A key repo interest rate, called the Treasury GCF Repo Index , shot up to 33 basis points to 5.22%.
Based on trades that go into the calculation of another benchmark interest rate, called SOFR, Stanford’s Duffie estimated that roughly $600 billion worth of trades were executed at much higher rates.
The fact that banks didn't borrow more from the SRF to lend at the higher rates pointed to their balance sheet constraints rather than liquidity problems in the financial system, according to Duffie and the banking source.
People are already worrying about what would happen at the end of the year, when even the U.S. banks pull back from the market, leaving less intermediation capacity in repo markets. The banking source said they expect borrowers to seek repo loans for a term spanning several days, as against the typical overnight trade, to get over the hump.
NYU's Acharya said there is a risk that the intervention could create moral hazard. “If the market's perception is that the Fed is always going to be there, why would they manage this liquidity risk?"" he said.

As good as the economy might seem across most major indicators, inflation that peaked at 9% more than two years ago has been hard for Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to outrun, and given former President and Republican candidate Donald Trump a cudgel that remains effective on the eve of the election even as inflation has dwindled to 2.4%.
""Inflation has not faded as an issue,"" said Justin McCarthy, a spokesperson for Gallup, the polling giant that fields monthly surveys that include an open-ended question, without lists or prompts, of what respondents feel is the ""most important"" issue facing them. Those citing inflation as the most serious issue has fallen from highs of around 20% during the peak inflation surge in 2022 to around 15% in recent polls, but that remains double the historic norm and is part of broader concern about the economy cited by more than 40% of respondents.

'UNAMBIGUOUSLY NEGATIVE'
Solutions have been offered by both campaigns, but inflation, the responsibility first and foremost of the Federal Reserve through its management of interest rates and credit conditions, is difficult for elected officials to address.

Republican President Richard Nixon tried the direct route by freezing wage and price increases for 90 days in 1971 and establishing a government panel to approve them after that. Inflation was 4.3% at the time and did fall below 4% in the summer of 1972 as Nixon campaigned for reelection.
But it soared that fall as the controls were eased, and following an embargo by Arab oil exporters in 1973 exceeded 12% by the end of 1974.
When inflation started rising during his term in office, Democratic President Jimmy Carter used a major address in 1978 to announce plans to limit government spending and call for voluntary wage and price limits from business. By the middle of his losing reelection bid against Republican Ronald Reagan prices were rising more than 14% annually.
After two recessions, a period of punishing interest rates imposed by the Fed and its firmer commitment to inflation control, price increases gradually settled close to the 2% level the central bank eventually adopted as its official target - and stayed there until the COVID-19 pandemic.
Economists have sparred over the exact reasons inflation took off beginning in 2021, and if that could have been prevented. But they generally agree on the broad mix. As the pandemic limited spending on in-person services, it also created deep backlogs in the manufacture and delivery of the goods, from bikes to appliances to automobiles, that were suddenly in high demand as a result of roughly $5 trillion in stimulus from the federal government.
The pandemic support began under Trump; Biden added more in a move some economists feel may have supercharged demand beyond what was needed.
It is a debate being litigated in hindsight and in the shadow of a health crisis that lingered long enough - new COVID variants were still suppressing in-person gatherings through 2021 - to even implicate the Fed. Inflation took off in 2021; the central bank did not raise rates until March 2022.
What doesn't seem in doubt is the impact on the public mood, something that shouldn't be a surprise.
Surveys about inflation have been consistent in finding that price shocks register deeply and are not quickly forgotten.
""Inflation significantly complicates household decision-making, which is seen as its most critical consequence,"" researchers Alberto Binetti of Bocconi University and Francesco Nuzzi and Stefanie Stantcheva of Harvard University concluded from the results of an online survey of 2,264 people conducted between March and May. ""This complexity affects daily economic choices"" and adds to economic uncertainty.
Nor do people seem to care much if, as has happened recently and Democrats have tried to emphasize, wages rise faster than prices.
""Inflation is perceived as an unambiguously negative phenomenon without any potential positive economic correlates,"" they found, with people expecting it to be fixed ""without significant trade-offs.""

"With polls tight, US election campaigns target overseas voters","ARIS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Bob Vallier, a Paris resident who has mostly lived outside the United States for the past 30 years, has already voted in his home state of Michigan for the Nov. 5 election.
""I know that whatever happens in America affects the rest of the world. I know this because I've lived in the rest of the world,"" said Vallier, the LGBTQ+ caucus chair for Democrats Abroad.

Vallier's vote, and the ballots of other Americans overseas, may be crucial in the tight races of battleground states like his. Michigan is one of the election's most competitive states, with latest polls showing Democratic candidate Kamala Harris holding a slight edge over Republican rival Donald Trump.
When watchmaker Quinn Lai heard Washington was closing its so-called de minimis rule,




The Democratic National Committee estimates that 1.6 million U.S. voters abroad are eligible to vote in one of the seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - that will likely determine the outcome of the election.
The group is believed to favor Democrats. Among people who used Vote From Abroad, a nonpartisan voter support tool linked to the DNC, three-quarters of overseas voters in the 2020 election said they were Democrats.

So for the first time in a presidential election the DNC has given Democrats Abroad funding - around $300,000 - to help register Americans overseas to vote and ramp up its mail-in voting operations and other efforts. It has taken out ads on social media urging Americans abroad to send in their ballots.
""This election will be won on the margins, and every single vote counts,"" said DNC spokesperson Maddy Mundy in a statement. ""We're going to win this election by engaging every eligible voter, no matter where they live.""

TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN LOOKS AT TAX RED TAPE
Republican presidential candidate Trump is also after American expatriates. Earlier this month he said he would end the double taxation of overseas Americans.
The former president's campaign has not offered further detail on how the policy would work but it could end a burdensome requirement that mandates U.S. citizens to file income taxes in the United States regardless of where they live.
While Americans abroad do not have to pay U.S. tax on their first $126,500 in earned income and are eligible for some foreign tax credits, it can be a bureaucratic headache expatriates from many other countries don't face.

""For many Americans abroad, including myself, the only consistent interaction we have with the U.S. government is through the IRS every April when we have to file and pay our taxes,"" said Zennon Kapron, a Singapore-based fintech consultant registered to vote in New York, when asked if Trump's proposal was a factor he would consider.
""If a candidate seriously addresses tax reform for expatriates, that could influence my decision,"" he added.

Solomon Yue, chief executive of Republicans Overseas, said Republicans had fought to improve taxation policies for Americans abroad for years, adding it could ""totally"" impact the expatriate vote.
""I already see Democrats Abroad panicking,"" he said.
Despite Trump's tax pledge, he has also said, without evidence, that Democrats are pursuing the overseas vote to cheat.
The Republican National Committee, which is largely integrated with the Trump campaign, has targeted overseas voting in legal challenges, notably Pennsylvania. If the lawsuit is successful, it would decrease the number of Americans abroad who could vote.
The move to try to block some overseas votes prompted six Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to write a letter to the defense secretary asking if the lawsuit would ""affect the constitutional rights of service members"" and referred to House Republicans' allegations as an attempt ""to sow discord and misinformation.""
Two other lawsuits in Michigan and North Carolina filed by Republican officials that aimed to block some Americans living overseas from voting in those states were thrown out by judges on Monday.
THE HURDLES TO VOTE
The challenge with attracting overseas voters, a group whose size is estimated by major political parties and outside experts to be somewhere between 4.4 million and 9 million, is that only a small fraction are believed to vote.
Unlike citizens of many other countries, U.S. voters cannot line up on Election Day at their embassies. Instead, they must submit ballots to the states where they are registered, usually by mail.
According to the U.S. Federal Voting Assistance Program, most eligible overseas voters tend not to vote, with fewer than 8% estimated to have sent in ballots in the 2020 presidential election, compared with an overall turnout rate of 67%. The overseas voter participation rate in the 2022 midterm elections was just 3.4%.
In a neighborhood in central Paris, volunteers set up a stand every Monday and Tuesday afternoons outside a cafe to try and up that percentage by helping Americans navigate the bureaucracies of state and local election laws.
Over the course of two hours, they coax people through the process of registering to vote or to fill out backup ballots in case things went awry with their original one.
""The problem is that the instructions are not understandable,"" said one of the volunteers, Tanya, a retired lawyer.
Claudie Le Corre, a resident of a southeastern Parisian suburb, came to the stand last week because she had not received her ballot from New York, where she's registered. She believed she had been removed from the voter rolls and filled out paperwork to re-register.
""I am worried about the future, for our children, and all these populist movements - which include Donald Trump - worry me,"" Le Corre said.

"US Supreme Court revives Virginia's voter roll purge of 1,600 purported noncitizens","WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court has reinstated Virginia's decision ahead of the Nov. 5 election to purge from its voter rolls about 1,600 people who state officials concluded were not American citizens, though President Joe Biden's administration and voting rights groups said actual citizens were among those struck.
The justices on Wednesday blocked a judge's Oct. 25 order requiring Virginia to restore the affected people's voting registration. It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in U.S. federal elections. Governor Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, on Aug. 7 announced a new policy for culling from Virginia's official voter registration list people ""unable to verify that they are citizens,"" with daily data sharing among state agencies.
The Reuters Tariff Watch newsletter is your daily guide to the latest global trade and tariff news. Sign up here.
When watchmaker Quinn Lai heard Washington was closing its so-called de minimis rule,




The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Its three liberal justices dissented from Wednesday's action.
Youngkin hailed the court's action on an initiative he described as a ""critical fight to protect the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens.""
""This is a victory for commonsense and election fairness,"" Youngkin said.
Voting rights advocates and the Justice Department had challenged Virginia's actions.

""The department brought this suit to ensure that every eligible American citizen can vote in our elections. We disagree with the Supreme Court's order,"" a department spokesperson said.
U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles had decided that Virginia's ""systematic program"" of voter list maintenance occurred too close to the election in violation of federal law.
Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate facing Democrat Kamala Harris in Tuesday's election, has made his anti-immigrant views a centerpiece of his campaign. He and his allies have made claims, without citing evidence, that large numbers of noncitizens could vote in the election. Studies have shown that voting by noncitizens is very rare.

Harris campaign spokesperson Charles Lutvak said the court's ruling did nothing to change the fact that ""every eligible voter has a right to cast their ballot and have their vote counted.""
""Our campaign is going to make sure every eligible voter is able to vote,"" Lutvak said, adding that ""voting by noncitizens remains illegal under federal law.""
With opinion polls showing Harris ahead of Trump in Virginia, the state is not considered among the closely contested ones that are expected to determine the outcome of the presidential race. But with immigration figuring as a key issue in the campaign, court fights over voter list purges in Virginia and Alabama of suspected noncitizens have drawn attention.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
In announcing his policy less than three months before the election, Youngkin said the voter-roll maintenance program would include ""scrubbing the lists to remove those that should not be on it, like the deceased, individuals that have moved, and non-citizens that have accidentally or maliciously attempted to register.""
Virginia already had an existing mechanism to remove noncitizens from its rolls, but Youngkin's executive order increased the frequency of data sharing between government agencies from monthly to daily, and made clear that the process would continue as the election drew closer.

A 'QUIET PERIOD'
At least 18 U.S. citizens were wrongly scrubbed from the voter rolls since the new policy took effect, according to voting rights groups including the League of Women Voters of Virginia that filed a lawsuit on Oct. 7 in federal court challenging the purge. The Justice Department brought a similar challenge four days later. The cases were consolidated.
The challengers argued, among other things, that Virginia's voter roll purge violated a 1993 federal law called the National Voter Registration Act that contains a so-called ""quiet period provision"" barring states from the ""systematic"" - as opposed to individualized - removal of people on voter lists within 90 days of an election.
A systemic approach, they argued, risks mistakenly purging valid voters - including naturalized citizens whose state Department of Motor Vehicles documents are outdated - with too little time to correct errors before Election Day.
Of the roughly 1,600 people removed from Virginia's voter rolls since Aug. 7, about 600 had indicated to the DMV that they were not U.S. citizens, according to Virginia's filing to the Supreme Court. The other 1,000 had presented documents to the DMV showing they were noncitizen residents, and were later identified as noncitizens through a federal database, the state's filing said.
Those who were flagged for removal were first notified and given 14 days to affirm their citizenship before being taken off Virginia's list of registered voters, the state said.
Giles, a Biden appointee, on Oct. 25 preliminarily blocked Virginia from enforcing its policy, and ordered the state to restore to the voter registration of the roughly 1,600 people.
Trump called the judge's ruling ""a totally unacceptable travesty"" and said the Supreme Court ""will hopefully fix it.""
The Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 27 refused to revive Virginia's policy, prompting the state's emergency filing to the Supreme Court.

Harris to travel to Texas as Democrats hope to flip Senate seat,"WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris will travel to Texas on Friday for an abortion-rights event as Democrats' hopes rise they can win a Senate seat in the Republican stronghold, according to a senior Harris campaign official.
Republican Donald Trump holds a comfortable lead on Vice President Harris in Texas, which has not voted for a Democratic president since 1976. This makes the trip a notable departure from the seven key battleground states for the Democrat in the final two weeks of the race for the White House.

In Houston, Harris will appear with Allred and criticize both Cruz and Trump on abortion rights in a state that has a near-total abortion ban, the Harris campaign official said. Harris will also participate in an interview with the podcaster Brene Brown during the trip.

"Irish PM kicks off election focussing on immigration, housing and Trump","DUBLIN, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris on Friday announced the formal start of the country's general election campaign, hoping to retain his coalition's lead in polls and to capitalise on a slide in support for the opposition Sinn Fein.
Harris had until March to go to the polls, but has been paving the way for an earlier election since a 10.5-billion-euro giveaway budget that began hitting voters' wallets this month. He confirmed this week that voting day would be Nov. 29.

In an effort to lure scientists to Europe, France and the European Union on Monday announced half a billion euros worth of incentives for researchers.




""The time is now right to ask the Irish people to give a new mandate,"" Harris told journalists in front of his office, before departing for the president's residence to seek the formal dissolution of parliament.
The left-wing Sinn Fein's ambition to prevent an unprecedented fourth successive term for Harris' Fine Gael looked probable a year ago, but its support has collapsed over the last year and been further hit by a string of internal controversies.

The campaign should be about who can ""credibly"" increase much needed housing supply, oversee a fair but firm immigration system, and prepare for a potential transatlantic trade shock from Donald Trump's election as U.S. president that could hit Ireland's finances, Harris said earlier on Friday.
""Our discussion in the weeks ahead does need to broaden. Up until now it's been about how you're going to spend the money available to government,"" he said.

""Dependent on being able to spend that money is being able to generate it, keep jobs, keep investment and show leadership at an EU level.""
An average of the most recent polls put Fine Gael on 24.5%, its main coalition partners Fianna Fail on 21.5% and Sinn Fein on 18.5%, according to the Irish Polling Indicator. Sinn Fein was polling at 35% as recently as a year ago.
Speaking to supporters late on Thursday, Sinn Fein lawmakers said it was naive to write the party off as they sought to turn the focus to voter frustration over unaffordable housing costs and strained state services.

""Simon Harris and (Fianna Fail leader) Micheal Martin believe that they have it all sewn up. I think the people of Ireland will have something to say about that,"" Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said.
Sinn Fein needs a repeat of its stunning surge during the 2020 election campaign as it likely has to finish well ahead of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail to cut off their path to re-election, since both have pledged to govern together again without it.

Harris' summertime lead over Republican opponent Donald Trump in the race for the Nov. 5 election has all but evaporated, national opinion polls show, and she is within the margin of error in the battleground states that will likely decide the election, her campaign says.
But she has picked up a considerable advantage over Trump with women, who most polls and surveys show make up much of Beyonce's audience. Harris led Trump by 49% to 36%, or 13 percentage points, among women voters in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published late in August.

Williams said he was uncertain that Beyonce would reach voters who have questions about Harris. ""We must acknowledge that celebrities are great political advertisers, but they are not guarantors of political victory for candidates,"" he added.

The rally in Beyonce's hometown caps a string of political appearances and politically charged artistic works. In 2008, Beyonce's husband Jay-Z held a rally for Barack Obama, while Beyonce sang the national anthem and the Etta James classic ""At Last"" at Obama's 2009 inauguration.
She performed a rally for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 and endorsed Joe Biden and Harris in 2020 on Instagram.
Beyonce, whose Instagram account has 314 million followers, offers Harris access to a segment of the U.S. population, especially Black and younger voters, that is deemed crucial in a closely contested race against Trump.
Hollywood celebrities, including actors Julia Roberts and Jane Fonda, are campaigning for Harris, as are musicians Bruce Springsteen, Usher and Lizzo. Trump has won the endorsement of Ultimate Fighting stars, wrestler Hulk Hogan and musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock.
Young female residents of Houston were mixed on the politically charged performance of the city's biggest star.
""Beyonce is a national icon because at the end of the day, we all are people with our own views and values. Beyonce is brave enough to stand by her values in the face of people judging her for it,"" said Nadira Smith, 27.

Exit polls capture variations among turnout in various demographic groups, such as men vs women voters or college-educated vs non-college-educated voters, and can provide insights into how turnout has changed from past elections.
One key advantage of exit polls is all the people surveyed, by definition, are people who cast ballots in this election.

Trump was also campaigning in Texas on Friday, making a stop in Austin to record an episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" a popular podcaster with tens of millions of social media followers, most of them men.

In his interview with Rogan, Trump again suggested he favored eliminating income tax and replacing the lost revenue with tariffs.
""Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs? Are we serious about that,"" Rogan asked.
""Yeah, sure. Why not?"" Trump replied.
Harris' team had been in touch with Rogan's program about a possible appearance, but scheduling did not line up, spokesperson Ian Sams said on MSNBC on Thursday.
Trump has lost ground with women voters since Harris became the Democratic candidate, polls show, although the two are in a tight race in the battleground states.
Harris led Trump by 49% to 36%, or 13 percentage points, among women voters in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published late in August, compared to her 9-point lead in polls conducted in July.
Trump has taken credit for appointing the justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.
Since winning the Republican primary earlier this year however, he has sought the support of moderate and independent voters, saying he would not support a national ban on abortions and that individual states should be free to restrict abortion as they choose.
He called for exceptions on any ban to include incidents of rape and incest or to protect the health of the mother. However, Trump said in August he would vote against an amendment in his home state of Florida to protect abortion rights that would lift a six week abortion ban, before many women know they are pregnant.
The majority of Americans disagreed with the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe, which fueled a wave of Democratic wins in the 2022 midterm elections and left Republicans scrambling to find a winning message on the issue.
PERSONAL STORIES
Texas Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred also attended Harris' rally, as Democrats sought to give him a boost in his bid to unseat Republican Senator Ted Cruz.
Harris led the Biden administration's reproductive rights initiatives and has made the issue a cornerstone of her presidential campaign.
Democrats have highlighted personal stories to show the impact of abortion being almost entirely banned in 16 states.
Ahead of the Houston trip, her campaign released an ad featuring a Texas woman who was denied an emergency abortion when her water broke at 16 weeks in 2022 and who then almost died of sepsis.
An analysis, opens new tab by JAMA Pediatrics, a medical journal, found that Texas saw a larger increase in infant mortality than the rest of the U.S. after enforcing the abortion ban, and early reports, opens new tab indicate that Texas has also seen a significant increase in maternal deaths.

Trump, the Republican candidate for president in 2024, continues to falsely claim that he lost the 2020 election due to extensive voter fraud, a view shared by millions of his supporters. Numerous inquiries, however, have found no evidence of fraud.
During his current run for president, Trump has suggested he will challenge the results if he does not prevail in the Nov. 5 contest against Democrat Kamala Harris, the US vice president.

His efforts to overturn the 2020 election led to his indictment by federal and state officials. He still awaits trial in those cases. His refusal to accept the outcome also sparked the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by thousands of his supporters.
Vance, a first-term U.S. senator, made headlines when he sidestepped the question during his debate with Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, on Oct. 1, saying he was focused on “the future.”

That led Walz to rebuke him. “That’s a damning non-answer,” he said.

OPTIMISM OVER TRUMP
The presidential candidates differ on domestic issues, but both have expressed support for the pact with Ethiopia. Mohamed A. Mohamoud, Somaliland's representative to Kenya, told reporters that the government would finalise the deal after the election, regardless of who wins.
The agreement has soured Mogadishu's relations with Addis Ababa, which is a major contributor to a peacekeeping force in Somalia fighting against Islamist militants there, and drawn Somalia closer to Ethiopia's historic rivals, Egypt and Eritrea.

Somaliland is also optimistic that the incoming Trump administration will revisit Washington's longstanding recognition of Mogadishu's sovereignty over Somaliland.
Several leading State Department officials who worked on Africa policy during Trump's first term have publicly voiced support for recognising Somaliland.
""We are hopeful that the new administration will defy some of the (traditional) American policy,"" Mohamoud said.

How Trump or Harris would address Social Security’s problems,"Oct 31 (Reuters) - The next U.S. president and Congress will need to tackle the financial challenges facing Social Security if we are going to avert a sharp cut in benefits to the 68 million retired or disabled Americans who rely on the program.
Social Security’s combined retirement and disability trust funds are on track to be depleted in 2035, according to the program's trustees. If we reach that point, we will be confronting a drastic across-the-board benefit cut of roughly 17%.

How would the two major-party candidates for president handle the problem?
Neither Democratic candidate Kamala Harris nor Republican candidate Donald Trump has articulated a specific plan for fixing Social Security - but here is what we do know as the U.S. election on Nov. 5 approaches.
TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS
Trump has made several campaign proposals that would hasten the insolvency of the two trust funds by three years, according to an analysis, opens new tab by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a bipartisan organization focused on federal fiscal policy. Using a separate projection from the Congressional Budget Office, CRFB calculates that insolvency would arrive much sooner, in 2031.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
Among the Trump campaign's proposals and the CRFB's conclusions:
- Eliminate taxation of benefits: Higher-income beneficiaries pay income taxes on part of their benefits, and those dollars flow into the Social Security trust funds. Eliminating this tax would cost the program $950 billion over 10 years, according to CRFB.
- End taxes on overtime and tips: This would reduce payroll tax collections, also costing Social Security $950 billion over 10 years, CRFB said.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
- Restrict immigration, impose tariffs: These moves would reduce the number of immigrant workers paying in to the Social Security trust funds, CRFB said. Tariffs would either increase cost-of-living adjustments through higher inflation or reduce taxable payroll due to reduced economic activity. Taken together, CRFB said the trust funds would take a $400 billion hit over 10 years.
The finding on immigration undercuts Republican claims that illegal aliens are sapping federal programs. Trump made a false claim about this during his June debate with President Joe Biden, saying, “Social Security, he’s destroying it, because millions of people are pouring in to our country, and they’re putting them onto Social Security.”) Trump ads running in swing states, which are likely to decide the election, are also making false claims about this.
Advertisement · Scroll to continue
The financial reality is quite different. CRFB notes that immigration expands the economy and the base of workers paying taxes in to Social Security. Undocumented workers often obtain jobs by using fake or borrowed Social Security numbers, but usually do not receive benefits.
Trump has said he would not cut benefits - but that alone will not avert the approaching cuts. And the broader Republican Party is on record as supporting benefit cuts to solve Social Security’s problems.

Project 2025, the governing blueprint for a second Trump administration produced by the Heritage Foundation, does not address Social Security reform. However, the foundation supports boosting the retirement age to 69 from 67, with further increases indexed to U.S. life expectancy.
Everyone born in 1960 or later, opens new tab already has taken a benefit cut of roughly 13% due to the reforms of 1983, which phased in an increase in Social Security’s full retirement age to 67 from 65. Raising the full retirement age further, to 69, would result in another average cut of 13%, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Like the earlier reforms, those changes would be phased in over time, exempting older workers. But they would hit today’s younger workers with full force.
HARRIS AND THE DEMOCRATS
Harris has promised not to cut benefits, and has indicated support for restoring trust-fund solvency with new taxes on the wealthy. Congressional Democrats have proposed legislation that would change the current cap on the amount of wages subject to payroll taxes ($168,600 this year, opens new tab) by adding a new tier of payroll taxes for higher-income Americans or identifying new sources of revenue. These would include taxes on investment income, and Harris supported those ideas when she served in the Senate. At the time, she also supported Democratic legislation that would raise revenue to modestly increase benefits.
Like Trump, Harris supports eliminating taxes on tips, although she coupled that with a call for higher minimum wages.
But it is clear where her party wants to go on Social Security. Democrats have proposed legislation that would address solvency by adding a new tier of payroll taxes for higher-income Americans, or by identifying new sources of revenue, such as taxes on investment income. Some of their proposals also include modest increases in benefits.
Polling data, opens new tab shows that very few (22%) know “a lot” about the plans of the two candidates for Social Security, and one-third of voters know “nothing at all.” It is difficult to understand why it has not been a bigger issue in the campaign, especially for Harris - the polling tells us that voters overwhelmingly support increasing benefits, or keeping them at their current level.
""In the policy world, there are plenty of proposals for addressing the problem,” said Maya MacGuineas, CRFB's president. “But then you move into the political environment and there’s a gag rule.”

U.S. stocks fell across the board Monday with the S&P 500 snapping its longest streak of gains in 20 years.




With a dead heat between Republican former President Trump and Democratic Vice President Harris and control of the U.S. Congress also at stake, investors are particularly nervy about an unclear or contested result, especially if it fuels unrest.
""Should the election result be uncertain for days or even weeks, gold would benefit from the resulting uncertainty,"" Commerzbank said in a note.
Trump has repeatedly said any defeat could only stem from widespread fraud, echoing his false claims from 2020. The winner may not be known for days if the margins in key states are as slim as expected.

Harris and Baier frequently talked over each other and Harris grew visibly frustrated, but she delivered her message for the Nov. 5 election to a conservative audience that might not often hear it.

She was asked to defend the administration's early decision to reverse some of the restrictive border policies of Republican rival Donald Trump when he was president and to respond to a mother who testified in Congress about the loss of her daughter at the hands of an immigrant in the U.S. illegally.

""I'm so sorry for her loss, but let's talk about what is happening right now,"" Harris said. She said Trump told Republicans to reject a bipartisan immigration bill early this year because ""he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.""
Trump and Republicans have claimed that immigrants are fueling violent crime in the United States, although studies show immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than others.

Asked about her recent comment that there was ""not a thing"" she would change about the actions of the Biden administration, Harris said, “Let me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency.""
She said she would bring in new ideas from Republicans and business leaders to solve housing shortages and expand small businesses.
TRUMP TEAM CALLS INTERVIEW 'TRAIN WRECK'
Harris was a vocal supporter of Biden when he faced mounting questions about his mental fitness after a disastrous June debate with Trump, before dropping out of the race in July. She was asked to defend those statements.

Biden has the “judgment” and “experience” to be president, she said, while questioning Trump’s fitness for office. “Joe Biden is not on the ballot, and Donald Trump is,” Harris said.
She was pressed on her position on using taxpayer funds for gender-affirming surgery for transgender inmates, including those who are undocumented. Trump has spent millions of dollars in ads on the subject in battleground states.
“I will follow the law,” Harris said, noting that the U.S. Bureau of Prisons provided gender-affirming treatments under Trump. She accused him of “throwing stones when you live in a glass house.”
The nearly 30-minute interview marked the first time Harris has appeared as a presidential candidate on the conservative media network, which often features opinion show hosts who mock her and other Democrats and tout Trump's policies.

Within minutes of the interview's end, the Trump campaign released a statement calling it a ""train wreck.""
David Urban, a political strategist and past Trump campaign aide, said Harris gave an uneven and subpar performance, avoiding responsibility and making Trump the scapegoat. ""Another losing media cycle for the Harris campaign,"" Urban said.
Democrats said Harris went on unfriendly territory and made it through without any gaffes. Repeated interruptions kept Harris's answers short, they said, preventing the meandering answers that she has been criticized for in the past.
“We feel like we definitely achieved what we set out to achieve,"" said Brian Fallon, a Harris spokesperson. ""She was able to reach an audience that has probably been not exposed to the arguments she’s been making on the trail, and she also got to show her toughness in standing tall against a hostile interviewer.""
COURTING REPUBLICANS
The interview was part of a direct appeal by Harris on Wednesday to Republican voters. Before the Fox News interview, she highlighted Republican support for her campaign in a pivotal county in Pennsylvania, one of the handful of swing states likely to determine the election.
In Bucks County outside of Philadelphia, Harris emphasized Trump's attempt to overturn his election loss four years ago, when he lost the White House to Biden.
She said Trump's actions violated the U.S. Constitution and that, if given the chance, he would violate it again.
""He refused to accept the will of the people and the results of a free and fair election. He sent a mob, an armed mob, to the United States Capitol, where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials and threatened the life of his own vice president,"" Harris said.
Over 100 Republicans joined Harris in Bucks County, including Adam Kinzinger, a former congressman and member of the committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Trump.
""No matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign,"" Harris said. She led Trump by a marginal 46% to 43% in a recent Reuters poll.
Trump on Wednesday participated in a town hall for Latino voters hosted by the Spanish-language network Univision. Fox News aired another Trump town hall with an all-women audience.
Harris has previously sought to court voters disillusioned by Trump. Former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, this month urged voters to put country over party and vote for Harris, saying Trump was not fit to lead the U.S.
Biden beat Trump in Bucks County by about 17,000 votes in the 2020 election, while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton beat Trump there in 2016 by fewer than 3,000 votes, according to county data.
This summer, Republicans overtook Democrats in the number of voter registrations in Bucks County for the first time in a generation. Republicans now have some 3,500 more voters in the county than Democrats, according to the latest data.
Harris is also weighing joining the podcaster Joe Rogan, whose show reaches millions of men across the political spectrum, and who has joked that a ""puppet master"" was behind Harris' strong debate performance against Trump last month.

Options traders adopted a defensive posture ahead of the election to hedge their portfolios from possible election-related volatility, including worries over a result that might be too close to call immediately or contested.
Many are now shifting to a bullish stance, wary of underperforming a market that has rallied following a victory by Donald Trump and Republican control of both houses of Congress, which had been anticipated following the election and was projected by Edison Research on Wednesday. The result is expected to give Republicans a freer hand in pursuing their economic agenda, which includes tax cuts and looser regulations.

""When you get these investors that pile in to calls ... this information moves into the stock and then you see the increase in the stock itself,"" according to OptionMetrics' DeSimone.
TEMPERED OPTIMISM
Of course, the so-called Trump trade could be in for twists and turns ahead, as details of the timing and implementation of the Republican policy agenda become clearer. Investors are also wary that parts of Trump’s economic platform, such as tax cuts and tariffs, could stoke inflation.
Some of those concerns have been reflected in a recent rise in Treasury yields, which could present an obstacle for stocks if it continues.
Stocks fell on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said there was no need given the strong economy. The effect of Trump’s policies on economic growth will not become clear until new laws or administrative edicts are approved or issued, he added.
That could be one reason why some measures of investor enthusiasm remain far from the euphoric levels reached in past market rallies.
For instance, one gauge of S&P 500 skew - which measures the relative demand for bullish calls versus bearish puts - has fallen to 4%, from a level of 7% just before the election, indicating investors have grown less defensive. But it has been even lower at various times this year, including in May, when it stood at 3%.
""This suggests markets are maintaining some degree of caution rather than displaying complete complacency,"" DeSimone said.

Trump's pro-Israel cabinet picks upset Muslims who voted for him,"ASHINGTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Muslim leaders who supported Republican Donald Trump to protest against the Biden administration's support for Israel's war on Gaza and attacks on Lebanon have been deeply disappointed by his cabinet picks, they tell Reuters.
""Trump won because of us and we're not happy with his secretary of state pick and others,"" said Rabiul Chowdhury, a Philadelphia investor who chaired the Abandon Harris campaign in Pennsylvania and co-founded Muslims for Trump.

Rexhinaldo Nazarko, executive director of the American Muslim Engagement and Empowerment Network (AMEEN), said Muslim voters had hoped Trump would choose cabinet officials who work toward peace, and there was no sign of that.
""We are very disappointed,"" he said.
""It seems like this administration has been packed entirely with neoconservatives and extremely pro-Israel, pro-war people, which is a failure on the on the side of President Trump, to the pro-peace and anti-war movement.""

""It's like he's going on Zionist overdrive,"" he said. ""We were always extremely skeptical ... Obviously we're still waiting to see where the administration will go, but it does look like our community has been played.""
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Several Muslim and Arab supporters of Trump said they hoped Richard Grenell, Trump's former acting director of national intelligence, would play a key role after he led months of outreach to Muslim and Arab American communities, and was even introduced as a potential next secretary of state at events.
Another key Trump ally, Massad Boulos, the Lebanese father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany, met repeatedly with Arab American and Muslim leaders.

Will Trump's unbridled rhetoric cost him the US election?,"GREENSBORO, North Carolina, Oct 27 (Reuters) - With his third straight U.S. presidential campaign coming down to the wire, Donald Trump mused at a rally about hydrogen-powered cars exploding, lamented how difficult it is to get spray paint off limestone and marveled at how billionaire backer Elon Musk’s rocket had returned to Earth in one piece.
He complained Democratic rival Kamala Harris wasn’t working as hard as he was, praised Chinese President Xi Jinping as ""fierce"" and called former President Barack Obama ""a real jerk"".

His aides had billed the event in battleground North Carolina as economy-focused, but that issue was just the warm-up.
In the countdown to the Nov. 5 election, the former president is campaigning in a way that some political commentators say could lose him precious votes against his Democratic rival, Harris, in what could be one of the tightest contests for the White House in history.
Surveys show the race is so tight that the result could hinge on a few thousand votes in several competitive states.

The Harris campaign is closing out its campaign by calling Trump “unstable” and “unhinged”. She is increasingly embracing those terms and pointing to Trump's ramblings as evidence he isn't fit for the presidency.
Trump defends his scattershot approach by saying he does something he calls “the weave” – in which he claims he always returns to his initial point – and supporters say his unscripted style is part of his appeal.

""His patented weave is a brilliant method to convey important stories and explain policies that will help everyday Americans turn the page from the last four years of Kamala Harris' failures,"" said Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump's campaign.
Trump’s rallies have always featured their share of diversions and odd tangents. But with the clock ticking, the former president seems content to burn precious minutes telling stories about his White House days, musing about a dead athlete's penis size, going where his mind takes him.

“They gave Obama the Nobel Prize,"" he said on Thursday in Las Vegas. ""He didn’t even know why the hell he got it. He still doesn’t. He got elected and they announced he’s getting the Nobel Prize. I got elected in much bigger, better crazier election but they gave him the Nobel Prize.”
Though no rally is ever exactly alike, a consistent theme is Trump's false assertion that in four short years Democrats have transformed the nation into a dystopian state.

He denounces his political opponents as the ""enemy from within"" and peppers his remarks with graphic accounts of murders and rapes of young women, false tales of violent gangs taking over small towns and debunked claims about immigrants eating stolen pets.
“We’re like a garbage can for the world,” he bemoaned in Arizona.
Trump aides say he sets the pace and talks as long as he wants. They don't try to contain him -- and they have put him in forums such as podcasts where his rambling ways can find a home and he won't be subjected to a battery of questions.
During a lengthy interview with podcaster Joe Rogan on Friday, Trump said that there may be life on Mars even though, as Rogan noted, probes have found no evidence.
He also claimed windmills have a negative effect on whales. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says there are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.
""I want to be a whale psychiatrist,"" Trump said.
FRENETIC SCHEDULE, INDULGENT FLOURISHES
Trump has adopted a more frenetic campaign schedule with time growing short. Last week, he held events in six of the seven states likely to decide the election.
Talk of border security and crime dominated, but Trump always found time for indulgent flourishes.
On Wednesday in Duluth, Georgia, he went on an extended riff about how he averted a trade war with France over champagne. He spoke for so long that many in the arena began to leave.
Trump of late has been making headlines in ways that have nothing to do with how he would run the country.
He turned one rally into an impromptu dance party, swaying on stage to his favorite numbers for nearly 40 minutes. He shared a locker-room tale about the purported size of golfer Arnold Palmer’s penis.
John Geer, an expert on public opinion at Vanderbilt University, said Trump's road show is aimed at one audience: his base.
""Trump thinks what he says, even if incoherent, appeals to his base,"" Geer said. ""If he wanted to expand his coalition, he would not be engaged in random rhetoric.""
The event before a crowd of about 7,500 people in Greensboro last week illustrated best how Trump is approaching his final days on the trail.
After talking about the border and restoring U.S. manufacturing, Trump bashed Harris for not campaigning that day and called her weak. He praised foreign strongmen such as Xi and Russia's Vladimir Putin, and mocked celebrities who had attended Harris’ rallies: ""These are not stars to me.""
Trump then launched into a long tale about how he was on the phone earlier this month with a “very important guy” but was distracted watching TV footage of a SpaceX rocket returning to Earth.
“I see this 20-story huge tube pouring down, you know fires pouring out, and it used to be white, but the heat is thousands of degrees coming down. They say thousands and thousands, so it had been beat up on that trip down. And I see this massive tube is coming down and the fires burning and it's ... exploding all over the place,” Trump said, motioning with his hands. “I said ‘Oh, this is terrible. It’s going to crash. What the hell is it?' I wasn’t sure ... maybe it was a movie.”
That led to a tangent where he compared his plan to exempt interest on car loans to the invention of the paper clip.
“It’s very simple,” Trump said. “Somebody came up with it 129 years ago or something. They came up with the paper clip. Then other people looked at it, they said, ... ‘Why didn’t I think of this idea?'”
At that point, Trump noticed how far he had veered off script. “I haven’t looked at the teleprompter for 15 minutes,” he boasted.

"In Susie Wiles, Trump picks quiet competence for chief of staff","Nov 11 (Reuters) - When Donald Trump took the stage in West Palm Beach, Florida, to claim victory in last week's presidential election, he called his campaign manager Susie Wiles out from behind a row of his relatives to thank her.

Trump invited Wiles to address the crowd. She shook her head several times and quickly retreated to the back of the stage.

That self-effacement is characteristic of Wiles, a longtime Florida-based Republican strategist whose shrewd strategies, low profile, and work ethic are credited with helping Trump stage a stunning political comeback, culminating in his Nov. 5 victory in the presidential election.
During his victory speech, Trump added, that, while Wiles - whom he described as an ""ice maiden"" - liked to stay in the background, his victory had changed things: ""She's not,"" Trump said, ""in the background.""

As president-elect, Trump's first appointment was tapping Wiles as chief of staff of his incoming administration, immediately transforming her into one of Washington's most important powerbrokers. He takes office on Jan. 20.
In interviews with around a dozen advisers, donors and allies, Wiles was described as a publicity-shy loyalist who helped craft Trump's winning message to Hispanics and working-class Americans. Along the way she also became a rare steadying influence on the famously mercurial Trump.

On the trail, Trump vowed retribution against political opponents, used racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric that demonized immigrants and said migrants who entered the United States illegally were ""poisoning the blood"" of the country. He frequently used apocalyptic language to describe a nation he said was in ruins and questioned whether his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, was Black.

It is not clear what role Wiles played in crafting those statements - Trump frequently veered off prepared speeches - or in Trump's decision to embrace even darker rhetoric in the closing weeks of the campaign.
Wiles, who sources said strived to steer clear of palace intrigue, is the only Trump campaign manager to have survived an entire campaign cycle without getting kicked out or demoted. Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns, for example, were characterized by infighting, leaks to reporters and firings.
As chief of staff, Wiles will face an even greater challenge to keep both Trump, 78, and his administration in check.
Trump cycled through four chiefs of staff during his chaotic 2017-2021 presidency. However, none of the four - Reince Priebus, John Kelly, Mick Mulvaney or Mark Meadows - had worked with Trump day-to-day on his campaign before being named to the job.
As chief of staff, Wiles will manage White House staff, organize the president's time and schedule, and maintain contact with other government departments and lawmakers.
Influential pro-Trump lobbyist and donor Brian Ballard said Wiles would provide ""sage counsel"" to Trump.
Wiles, who got her start on Republican Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and went on to work for several moderate Republicans, declined to comment on her future role.
A LOW PROFILE LOYALIST
While Wiles prefers to keep a low profile, she is no pushover, and politicians are loathe to cross her.
After falling out with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, whose 2018 gubernatorial campaign she is credited with helping to revive, she was hired by Trump to manage his Florida operation during his failed 2020 campaign.
Her knowledge of DeSantis later helped the Trump campaign go on an early blitz against the Florida governor in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries, in which Trump easily sidelined DeSantis, once seen as his heir apparent.
McMullen, Trump's former envoy, described Wiles as a calm manager who never raises her voice, does not seek to micromanage staff and is not out for personal glory.
""You'll never see Susie Wiles write a book about her experience, good or bad,"" McMullen added.
When Wiles joined the 2024 campaign, McMullen said, she immediately reached out to the leadership team in key states to tell them she would always be available. She also conducted bi-weekly calls with important Republicans, McMullen said, which kept ""the backbiters at bay.""
Wiles' personal history may have also helped set her up for this moment. Wiles is the daughter of the late Pat Summerall, who was a prominent football player and sportscaster.
""Susie had a father very much like Donald Trump, who is demanding and highly regarded in the public eye,"" McMullen said, adding that that experience has helped Wiles work with Trump.
A veteran of Trump's first White House tenure said Trump gravitates toward two types of people: Those who go on cable news networks to defend him and others who are quietly competent.
""She happens to be one who puts her head down and works very hard,"" the source said.

Exit polling reflects just a slice of the tens of million of people who have voted, both before and on Election Day, and the preliminary results are subject to change through the course of the night as more people are surveyed.
National exit-poll results provide an important window into the thinking of the nation, but may not directly align with the seven battleground states expected to decide the presidential election.
Exit polls capture variations among turnout in various demographic groups, such as men vs women voters or college-educated vs non-college educated voters, and can provide insights into how turnout has changed from past elections.
One key advantage of exit polls is all the people surveyed, by definition, are people who cast ballots in this election.

Powell indicated that as long as encouraging disinflation trends persisted the Fed would continue a gradual process of getting interest rates back to a neutral level well below current levels and said it would not react to speculation about government policy shifts until concrete plans were presented.

Kamala Harris struggles to secure men's support in labor unions,"WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - With the U.S. election days away, Vice President Kamala Harris is struggling to secure the support of male volunteers in some labor unions whose phone calls and house visits are needed to get Democratic supporters out to vote, senior labor officials said.
Most unions have long supported Democratic candidates, and both Harris and President Joe Biden have backed unions in contract negotiations and championed workers' rights.

When watchmaker Quinn Lai heard Washington was closing its so-called de minimis rule,




But Republican candidate Donald Trump, who was president from 2017-2021, has made inroads with union workers in recent years and any drop in support for Harris could be a decisive factor in the neck-and-neck race.
If elected, Harris would make U.S. history as the first female and second Black president, and sexism and racism have been seen as a hurdle to her winning.
Liz Shuler, president of the 12.5 million-member AFL-CIO, said enthusiasm for Harris is strong overall but sexism is likely undermining support for her in some unions.

""Let's be honest, there are people who look at a female candidate and at face value dismiss her because, you know, she's perceived as not being presidential,"" she said. ""No one questions Donald Trump in that way.""
Finding these men at home can be a challenge and the AFL-CIO is addressing the problem instead by visiting men at their job sites, where chances of a conversation to address their concerns are much higher, she said.

The problem is especially acute within the building trades unions like electricians and pipefitters, whose members are predominantly male and white.
Larger service unions, where membership is more diverse, have witnessed a growing gender gap, where a drop in male support has been offset by a surge in support from women, labor officials say.
It's part of a phenomenon playing out across the country that could be a pivotal factor in the election, Reuters polling shows - Harris is gaining with women, especially white women, while Trump is polling better with men than he was in 2020.

James Maravelias, head of the Delaware AFL-CIO, said Harris' support among male members has been weaker in part because of her liberal track record on social issues and in part because of male chauvinism.
""I am afraid some won't come out at all,"" Maravelias said about potential impact on Election Day.
In interviews, AFL-CIO door knockers said some households view Harris and Democrats as strong defenders of union rights while others have lost faith in the Democratic Party and see more common ground with Trump.

“The men are the toughest doors,” said one of six door knockers interviewed. “They want to argue and there’s no agreement on the facts.”
An AFL-CIO-led door-knocking effort in the Philadelphia area was forced to narrow its focus to known Harris supporters after an expected wave of volunteers failed to materialize, according to a local organizer.
Maggie Mullooly, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia chapter of the AFL-CIO, said the labor group's mobilization efforts have been robust and lack of volunteers is not an issue.
Labor volunteers have knocked on over 160,000 doors in the Philadelphia region and on track to knock on 220,000 more by Election Day, she said. The information was supplied on Friday, following the story’s initial publication.
Most major unions have endorsed Harris, including the United Auto Workers union, but it is a mixed picture at the rank-and-file level across industries and different parts of the country.
POLL FAVORS HARRIS, BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO HELP HER WIN?
Support for Harris remains strong in Racine, Wisconsin, said Richard Glowacki, chairman of the UAW Local 180, which represents workers at a CNH Industrial's sprawling tractor factory on the outskirts of that faded blue-collar city.
He called demand for Harris' and other Democrats' yard signs ""unreal"" and said retirees are actively getting out the vote.
But the 1.3 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, representing workers ranging from airline pilots to zookeepers, decided not to endorse a candidate in this election after a poll of members found Trump led Harris by 59.6% to 34%.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Harris leading Trump 47%-36% among Americans who were union members or had a family member in a union. The survey of 655 union household respondents was held Oct 16-21 and had a margin of error of about 4 percentage points.
In the 2020 election, Biden had a 16-point advantage over Trump - 56% to 40% - in an Edison Research poll of people who lived in households with a union member.
Steep losses in support among non-college educated males could be made up by gains from non-college educated women, according to a senior campaign official.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
UNION VOTES MATTER
Union workers make up one-fifth of the voters in battleground states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, says the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the country that counts several building trades unions among its members.
The three states, known as the ""Blue Wall"" for their importance to Democrats, are among the seven battlegrounds that will decide Tuesday's presidential election.
Unions are also key to Democrats' ""Get out the vote"" efforts in these states, and their members traditionally knock on thousands of doors ahead of elections to rally voters.
Harris, who is also of South Asian origins, has dismissed concerns that sexism could hurt her chances of winning the White House, saying the country is ""absolutely"" ready to elect a female president.
Jimmy Williams, president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), which has over 140,000 members, said a drop in support from men is being more than offset by women within his union.
""I have spoken to women members in the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio and I can tell you, not one woman member that I have spoken to, has been somebody who has been supportive of Donald Trump, not one,"" he said.

Trump has been far less openly supportive of Ukraine in its war against Russia than incumbent President Joe Biden or Harris, raising fears in Kyiv that it could lose its most important ally if he wins.
Trump, who has repeatedly praised Putin over the years and boasted of having a good working relationship, last week blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for helping start the war.
This month he declined to confirm reports he had spoken to Putin on several occasions since leaving office in 2021 saying only: ""If I did, it's a smart thing.""

Harris by contrast has called Putin ""a murderous dictator"", vowed to continue backing Ukraine, and said that opposition politician Alexei Navalny's death was ""a further sign of Putin's brutality."" The Kremlin has denied any hand in Navalny's demise.
State TV has often showcased guest speakers on its prime time geopolitical talk shows who express a preference for Trump, even if their reasons sometimes vary.

Andrei Sidorov, a senior academic at Moscow State University, told a major state TV talkshow this month that Trump would be better for Russia because he would stir division that could trigger a long-held fantasy of anti-Western Russian hawks - the disintegration of the United States during infighting between its constituent states.
""I am for Trump. I was always for Trump - he's a destroyer. If he's elected ... then civil war will really be on the agenda,"" Sidorov said, forecasting a Democratic win would see the same ""crap"" as now continuing.
""(But) Trump could really lead to our geopolitical adversary collapsing without any missiles being fired.""
'NO ILLUSIONS'
A 2017 U.S. intelligence report said Putin had directed a sophisticated influence campaign to denigrate Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and support Trump in the 2016 race for the White House. The Kremlin denied meddling and Trump denied any collusion with Russia during that campaign.
Despite the two current candidates' different approaches to Moscow, some Russian officials - who are navigating the worst period in U.S.-Russia relations since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis - have expressed wariness of both.
Harris, they say, would mean a continuation of what Moscow sees as Biden's proxy war with Russia ""to the last Ukrainian.""
Trump, who raised hopes in Moscow of better ties before he took office in 2017, is remembered for imposing sanctions when in the White House despite warm words about Putin. In Moscow's eyes, he appeared boxed in on Russia policy by the wider U.S. political establishment.
""I have no illusions. (When Trump was president) he had several conversations with President Vladimir Putin. He received me at the White House a couple of times. He was friendly,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recalled in September.
""But sanctions against the Russian Federation were imposed under President Trump on a regular basis. As a result, we concluded that we need to rely on ourselves. We will never in our history count on 'a good guy' getting into the White House.""
One senior Russian source said there were different views at top levels of the Kremlin about Trump, but confirmed some believed a Trump victory might not go well for Moscow.
""Look what happened last time he became president. Everyone said beforehand that U.S.-Russia relations would benefit, but they ended up even worse. Trump says a lot of things but doesn't always do what he says,"" said the source, who declined to be named given the matter's sensitivity.
The same source questioned whether Trump's purported reluctance to keep financing and arming Ukraine and his talk of being able to end the war swiftly would survive lobbying efforts from powerful U.S. factions who argue that Ukraine's fate is existential for the West and that Kyiv must not lose.
A second senior source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Moscow was not expecting much from either candidate. Trump had been ""pretty tough"" on Moscow when in power, was worryingly impulsive and had tough views on Russia's ally China, he said.
The source added that he did not expect to see big change in Moscow-Washington relations whoever was elected.
""Neither Trump nor Harris are going to change the relationship with Russia fundamentally. There is not going to be some great new friendship,"" said the source.
""The West views Russia and China as bad and the West as good and it is hard to see any leader changing a belief that is now ingrained within the Washington elite.""

As of Sunday, the Biden administration had approved more than $300 million in assistance across North Carolina, including $118 million in individual assistance to more than 87,600 households, and more than $189 million for debris removal and other emergency efforts. More than 1,500 federal personnel remain deployed to support the recovery.
Across all hurricane-affected areas in the Southeast and Appalachia, the Biden administration has approved nearly $2 billion for hurricane recovery assistance.
Some Democratic leaders are worried about the spread of misinformation, some of it by Trump, along with the post-storm flight of voters in Buncombe County, a Democratic stronghold in the 2020 election.
Trump has repeatedly and falsely accused Biden and Harris of using federal emergency funds on housing migrants in the country illegally. Despite White House denials, the rumors have spread quickly by word of mouth and online.
The Republican Party ""does not have to endorse the disinformation to benefit from it,"" said Asher Hildebrand, a professor at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy.
""I think our numbers may not be what they need to be,"" said Kathie Kline, Democratic chair in Buncombe County, which includes the city of Asheville.
""Buncombe County could very much - and this disaster could very much - have a lot to do with losing the election for Harris,"" Kline said.

""We were targeting a lot of or some Republicans that we thought were possibly persuadable,"" Kline said. Now she is reluctant to send anyone to knock on Republican voters' doors, because ""we just don't know about how volatile they might be.""
Democrats have been optimistic before about their chances of carrying North Carolina, only to have their hopes dashed. Former President Barack Obama in 2008 was the last Democrat to win the state, albeit by a mere 49.7% to 49.4%.
At one point Kline drove around a precinct to identify which areas they should not canvass because the damage was too significant, and displayed a color-coded map to volunteers.
""If we don't canvass and Harris loses, it could be our fault,"" Kline said. ""If we do canvass and we upset everyone that we're knocking on their doors, then we'll lose anyway.""
North Carolina State Representative Lindsey Prather, a Democrat seeking reelection in a district near Asheville, only recently resumed sending election information to supporters instead of hurricane-related texts.
Buncombe County Democrats have reduced their phone banking efforts and increased radio ads. Buncombe County Republicans have a team of 11 people pushing out at least 220 calls a day.
Indivisible Asheville/WNC, a progressive voter outreach group, is handing out election information at hurricane distribution centers and relying on local community members to find neighbors who need help getting to the polls.
Though first-day voting set a record, overall turnout remains a question mark. ""This (the hurricane) has changed everything,"" Prather said.

Republican former President Donald Trump faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's presidential election. Trump continues to make false claims of widespread voting fraud in his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden and has urged his supporters to turn out at polling places to watch for alleged fraud.
Judges in overnight decisions declined requests by Missouri and Texas for court orders to block the Justice Department monitors.

While Hollywood has a reputation for being liberal, some stars are working to turn out the vote for former President Trump. Dennis Quaid, who starred in a recent movie as Republican icon Ronald Reagan, spoke at a Trump rally in California.
""I'm here to tell you that it's time to pick a side,"" Quaid said to applause.
Other Trump supporters from the entertainment world include musicians Ted Nugent and Kid Rock, and wrestler Hulk Hogan, who spoke at this summer's Republican National Convention.

HELPING OR HURTING?
Will Garner, Quaid or any other movie star make a difference?
Celebrity appearances do amplify messages about voting, said Christian Grose, a political science professor and academic director at the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute.
If a non-famous person knocks on a door, it affects only that voter. When a celebrity does, it generates media coverage and social media posts that reach beyond that home, Grose said.
Whether that translates into higher turnout depends on the celebrity and the circumstances.
Megastars such as Oprah Winfrey can make a meaningful impact. Winfrey's 2007 endorsement of Barack Obama was credited with driving 1 million votes during the Democratic primary.
And pop megastar Taylor Swift stimulated thousands of new voter registrations with a nonpartisan call for people to register in 2023, according to the nonprofit group Vote.org.
This September, Swift went a step further and endorsed Harris via an Instagram post, which has now received more than 11 million likes.
While the Harris campaign welcomed Swift's support, it may not turn out to be a blessing, according to Mark Harvey, author of ""Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy,"" published in 2018.
Harvey and other researchers surveyed 1,000 people in August, before Swift's endorsement. Half were shown a photo of Swift with a generic message urging people to vote and half were shown the same image urging votes for Democrats.
In the study, the singer was most influential with undecided voters who were Swift fans. Swifties who saw the general message reported a high likelihood of heading to the polls. The intent to vote declined, however, among the Swift fans who saw the singer calling for ballots for Democrats.
""I think there are a lot people who don't want to mix their entertainment with their politics,"" said Harvey, an associate professor at the University of Saint Mary in Kansas.
And outside of the elite sphere of the biggest celebrities, studies suggest celebrity endorsements have ""no effect to marginal effect"" on turnout, Grose said.
Still, it is possible that the presidential race, and some races for the U.S. Congress could be decided by hundreds or thousands of votes.
""I wouldn't put it up there as the most critical part of the campaign,"" Grose said, ""but you certainly can mobilize people with enthusiasm and excitement and a little bit of Hollywood pizzazz showing up in places you wouldn't expect.""

Harris has been strongly critical of Putin and has said that if she wins she will work to ensure Kyiv prevails in the war and achieves a just peace, although she has not set out a detailed Ukraine strategy.
Trump has said that if he wins on Nov. 5 he could end the war in a day, before even taking office. He has not said how he would do so.
He has also criticised the amount of U.S. aid given to Ukraine, has repeatedly called President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ""the greatest salesman on Earth"" and this month accused him of helping start the war, even though the conflict broke out after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

She said Trump would ""restore world peace through American strength and ensure European nations carry their weight by paying their fair share to our mutual defense to lighten the unfair burden on American taxpayers"".
TOUGH MOMENT FOR KYIV, ALLIES
The tight U.S. election race comes at a tough moment for Kyiv and its European backers.
Moscow’s forces are advancing in eastern Ukraine. A harsh winter looms after massive Russian attacks on energy systems.
Domestic political troubles weigh down German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron. Public finances are tight across the continent. Russia-friendly populist parties have scored election successes in recent months in the European Parliament, Austria, and eastern Germany.
""The longer it (the war) lasts, the harder you have to work to maintain support for it because the more there will be voices that say: 'Why are we prolonging this conflict? It’s a huge meat grinder,'"" said a senior diplomat from a NATO country.
The main measure that Europeans hope would cushion Ukraine from any sudden U.S. policy change is the G7 loan of $50 billion, using profits from frozen Russian assets.
The loan - details of which were agreed last week - should allow Kyiv to keep buying arms even if American aid is cut.
""The G7 $50 billion for Ukraine is really important,"" said a Western official. ""Get that done and I think Ukraine is really fairly well set for 2025.""
NATO, meanwhile, is setting up a command to coordinate military aid for Ukraine, taking over much of the work of a U.S.-led ad-hoc coalition.
Officials say putting the effort under a NATO military structure insulates it from sudden political change. But it is far from bulletproof, given the U.S. is NATO's dominant power.
TRUMP APPEAL
In public comments, European officials are aiming to influence Trump and his supporters by declaring that a victory in Ukraine for Putin would make the U.S. look weak and embolden both Russia and China to challenge American power.
NATO boss Mark Rutte declared this month that Trump understands the war ""is not only about Ukraine, it's also about the safety and the future security of the United States"".
Trump and Harris met Zelenskiy separately in New York in September.
The Ukrainian leader has not publicly favoured either candidate, but said after the meetings, opens new tab it was important ""America has a direct understanding of Ukraine"" and that the war ""must be stopped with fairness, so that no aggressor will ever do what Russia is doing"".
Not all European leaders are nervous about Trump. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, opposes military aid to Ukraine and has made clear he thinks Trump shares his views.
Some Ukrainian and Eastern European officials, by contrast, speculate Trump might cross red lines set by Biden by giving more long-range arms and ending a ban on striking deep inside Russia - if Putin refused or reneged on any deal he offered.

"US economy is partying, but voters are hungover","WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - With less than a month to go before the U.S. elections, the American economy is in arguably in the best shape it has been prior to any presidential contest in recent history. Unemployment is at a more than two decade low. Gasoline prices aren’t as high as it may seem. Even inflation looks better. While Vice President Kamala Harris will likely not claim the full benefit of incumbency following President Joe Biden’s decision not to seek a second term, the economy’s recent performance should put the wind in her sails and blunt one of Republican nominee Donald Trump’s main arguments against her.
The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.




Yet a recovery may have come too late for Harris. Feelings of economic euphoria take time to sink in. It takes time for people to recognize the improvement in their situation after a period of economic volatility. That may explain why Harris still trails Trump in most polls on economic issues, as consumer confidence remains low. And she can’t change the fact that people feel less rich.

The labor market continues to be the economy’s engine, with little overall slippage from recent half-century lows in the unemployment rate.

Unemployment is at its lowest level of any recent election other than in 2000.

The consumer-price index has returned to acceptable levels after reaching a four-decade high earlier in Biden’s term. Despite the rapid price rises of 2021-2022, the current inflation rate is cooler than it was in the 1980s and 1990s, even if that might surprise many voters.

GASOLINE PRICES

Line chart showing gas prices in the U.S.
Gas prices are one of the most prominent tags voters see on a daily basis, and consumer sentiment is often closely related to their fluctuations. Political science research has consistently found that voters attribute outsize weight to them: A landmark 2016 paper, opens new tab that controlled for other economic factors and significant news found that a 10-cent increase in gasoline prices correlated with a 0.60% decrease in presidential approval. That makes any flare-up in oil markets particularly perilous to an incumbent party in an election year.

Part of the reason for lower inflation is the price of oil, in part due to a surge of U.S. exports. Geopolitical risks —especially a possible widened war in the Middle East — threaten to crimp supply and push Brent crude higher. But as it stands, prices at the pump are, even unadjusted for inflation, lower than they were during the runup to the 2012 election.
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE

For all the positive indicators, why does Harris trail Trump in most polls about who would handle economic issues better? Consumers remain battered from post-pandemic inflation. Consumer sentiment scars can take time to heal, as the period following the 2008 financial crisis illustrates. The twin hits of the pandemic shock and the subsequent inflation and Federal Reserve rate hike campaigns have taken their toll on consumers’ feelings about the economy, and the rebound is not yet complete.
HOUSEHOLD WEALTH

Household wealth in the United States is based on two main factors: real estate and the stock market. Major market swings in recent years have largely given way to growth in household wealth, but memories of the 2022-2023 market swoon may have left scars.
Still average household wealth can be deceiving in other ways: although around 65% of Americans own their homes, overall wealth, opens new tab is highly concentrated among the top 1% - in 2022, around 10% of U.S. households held about 75% of the wealth. So fluctuations in wealth, while they affect the broader population, are felt most by those at the very top, and may have little impact on overall voter sentiment.
Nevertheless, those voters felt a lot richer when Trump left office, partly because government spending to bolster the economy had irrationally inflated stock prices. Biden dealt with the hangover of that spending. Harris, though, is left with the election headache.

Back then, Fink praised Biden as the “voice of reason.” His and others’ changing stance shows how fear has trumped hope in U.S. politics, even in the boardroom.





The shift in political tone of power brokers from Silicon Valley to New York has been dramatic. The epicenter for this change is the tech-focused startup world. Venture capital bigwigs including Marc Andreessen, who claims to have been a long-time Democrat, are strongly supporting Trump. Tesla’s Chief Executive Elon Musk has gone further, shelling out tens of millions to back Trump’s campaign. Out of corporate self-interest, it seems rational. The Biden administration’s antitrust crackdown stymies the flow of startup sales to big technology firms. Add in traditional Republican friendliness to low taxes and laxer regulation, and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris always faced a tough road to winning technologists’ support.

But this new Silicon vanguard’s ascendancy contrasts with a pullback from other corporate leaders that suggests a different dynamic. Beyond Fink, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos stopped the Washington Post, the newspaper he owns, from endorsing a candidate. Then there is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest corporate lobbying group. A shift towards supporting Democrats in the last presidential cycle drew backlash from the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, opens new tab. Some prominent left-wing donors are quietly complaining that the group hasn’t more forcefully thrown itself behind Harris.

But what’s different now is that Trump has upped the ante when it comes to managing the public relationship between CEOs and the Oval Office. Bezos should know: Amazon protested, opens new tab losing out on a $10 billion defense contract during his term, blasting the process as “politically corrupted” by Trump’s personal antipathy to the company.

Other decisions seemed similarly aligned with grievances. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice sued to block telecom company AT&amp;T’s purchase of Time Warner, home of news network CNN, which drew the former president’s repeated ire.
Corporate chieftains like Fink and Bezos may believe that silence will keep them out of the firing line should Trump win. But kowtowing based on fear is a bottomless pit, especially when backlash to perceived slights is so unpredictable. Just ask the breathtakingly extensive list of close confidants who were dismissed from Trump’s previous administration.

Playing to the other side generates its own problems. Witness Democratic donor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman’s push to fire antitrust chief Lina Khan, which stiffened progressive groups’ resolve on competition policy. America’s corporate leaders may think elements are in their control, helped by their quiet flood of donations. In reality, they are losing their grip.

As the election draws closer, Harris has been sharpening her attacks on Trump's fitness for office, often calling him ""unstable"" or ""unhinged"" and questioning his temperament.

""Obviously, we want them to vote but we want them to live and survive and be happy and healthy, because this is really a tragedy,"" Trump said at a campaign stop in Swannanoa, population 5,300, after touring areas destroyed by the storm.
At an event with Harris in Royal Oak, Michigan, Cheney sought to give Republicans who are on the fence permission to support the Democrat without worry of reprisal.

The school has received 633 applications thus far, up from 385 this time last year, according to a report prepared by the Law School Admission Council and reviewed by Reuters. The council maintains a centralized application system for all U.S. law schools accredited by the American Bar Association.

Georgia is one of seven closely contested states that are expected to determine the outcome of the presidential race between Harris and Trump.
Republicans and their allies have filed dozens of lawsuits in battleground states seeking to purge voter rolls and limit overseas or mail-in voting. They say those efforts are designed to restore ""election integrity"" after the 2020 election, which Trump insists, falsely, was marred by fraud.

Democrats and legal experts argue that Republicans are seeking to sow doubt in the process and lay the groundwork to challenge a potential Trump loss. Trump's allies filed more than 60 lawsuits after the 2020 election seeking, unsuccessfully, to overturn his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.
U.S. election counting is decentralized, with local officials responsible for tabulating results in their precincts before they can be certified at the state level.

In his ruling, McBurney wrote that Adams and other local officials are responsible for counting results and taking notes of any concerns - such as more votes being received than there are voters in the precinct.
But he wrote that local officials' duty was to report any such problems to prosecutors for further investigation, not to delay certification and look into the issues themselves.
Separately, McBurney earlier this month heard a case brought by the Democratic Party over changes made by Georgia's Republican-controlled state election board that empower county board members to investigate results and examine election-related documents before certifying them.
Democrats urged the judge to either nullify the rules or clarify that the measures cannot interfere with the certification of the election by the Nov. 12 deadline. McBurney has not yet ruled in that case.
The Democrats have also sued to block the state election board's Sept. 20 decision to require a hand count of ballots.

Trump, at his first of three rallies on Sunday, frequently abandoned his teleprompter with off-the-cuff remarks in which he denounced opinion polls showing movement for Harris. He called Democrats a ""demonic party,"" ridiculed Democratic President Joe Biden and talked about the high price of apples.
Trump, who survived an assassination attempt in July when a gunman's bullet grazed his ear in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Sunday complained to supporters about gaps in the bulletproof glass surrounding him as he spoke and mused that an assassin would have to shoot through the news media to get him.
""To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news and I don't mind that so much,"" said Trump, who has long criticized the media and sought to rile public sentiment against them.
Last week he suggested prominent Republican critic, former congresswoman Liz Cheney, should face gunfire in combat over her hawkish foreign policy, leading an Arizona prosecutor to open an investigation.
Campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung issued a statement saying Trump's comment was not directed toward the media but rather, ""It was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats.""
Trump later spoke in Kinston, North Carolina, and in Macon, Georgia, where he seized on last week's jobs report that showed the U.S. economy only produced 12,000 jobs last month.
He told a large crowd gathered in an amphitheater that the report showed that the United States was a ""nation in decline"" and he warned darkly without evidence of a potentially looming repeat of the 1929 Great Depression with ""people jumping off buildings.""
Senior Harris campaign officials have said her closing argument is designed to reach a narrow slice of undecided voters. That stood in contrast to Trump, who varied little from his standard speech aimed at inspiring his loyal supporters.
""Kamala's campaign is run on hate and demonization,"" Trump said.
Near the end of his Pennsylvania speech, Trump - whose false claims that his 2020 loss was the result of fraud inspired his supporters' Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol - mused that he would have preferred not to have handed over power.
""We had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left. I shouldn't have left. I mean, honestly, because we did so, we did so well,"" Trump said.
Trump said during his remarks that election results should be announced on Election Night, despite warnings by officials in multiple states that it could take days to ascertain the final outcome.
Democrats say they have plans in place should Trump try to prematurely claim victory this time.

Georgia's top court deals setback to Trump allies in ballot hand-count case,"Oct 22 (Reuters) - Georgia's top court declined on Tuesday to hear an expedited appeal by Republicans of a decision blocking a new rule that would have required poll workers to hand-count ballots, a change that voting rights groups warned could have caused chaos.
The decision also means that county-level officials in the state, one of seven battlegrounds expected to play a decisive role in the Nov. 5 presidential election, will not have enhanced authority to challenge precinct-level results.

Republican candidate Donald Trump continues to falsely claim that his 2020 loss was the result of widespread fraud and his backers have filed a series of lawsuits across the U.S. challenging election rules.
The state Republican Party said in a statement that it did not plan an appeal of the decision before the election.
""It is supremely disappointing to observe yet another failure of our judicial system to expeditiously resolve critical questions about our elections process,"" state party Chairman Josh McKoon said in a statement. ""We will press our appeal next year.""

The rules, passed by the Georgia board's Republican majority, would have empowered county election board members to investigate discrepancies between the number of ballots cast and voters in each precinct, and examine troves of election-related documents before certifying their results.
One of the most controversial changes would have required poll workers in each of the state's more than 6,500 precincts to open the sealed boxes of ballots scanned by machines and conduct a hand count, starting as soon as election night.

Voting rights groups had said the rule could allow rogue county election board members to delay or deny certification of election results, throwing the state's vote into chaos, while the state attorney general's office warned the board was likely exceeding its statutory authority.
Georgia Supreme Court justices on Tuesday unanimously denied an emergency motion to pause an order blocking the rules and expedite their review of the case, a docket entry showed, meaning the appeal is unlikely to be decided until next year.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which intervened in the case to block the rules, praised the decision in a statement, saying the election board had sought to ""inject chaos and confusion into our democratic system.""
An election board representative and lawyers for the Republican National Committee, which intervened in the case on the board's behalf, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The changes by the election board were powered by three allies of former President Trump, who lost to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia in the 2020 election and made false claims of widespread voting fraud. Some senior Republicans continue to refuse to say that Biden was fairly elected in 2020.
Georgia is one of seven closely contested states that are expected to determine the winner of the presidential race between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Trump. U.S. presidential elections are decided through state-by-state results, not by a majority in the national popular vote.
Judge Thomas Cox on Oct. 16 struck down the rules described by Republicans as necessary election security measures but which Democrats said were aimed at impeding certification of results in a state that could be crucial in selecting the next president.
Cox said the rules contradicted state law and found that the board had overstepped its legal authority in several ways.
""The rules at issue exceed or are in conflict with specific provisions of the Election Code. Thus, the challenged rules are unlawful and void,"" Cox wrote.
The board's passage of the rules drew bipartisan criticism. The conservative group that brought the case on Sept. 11, Eternal Vigilance Action, argued the Georgia board exceeded its legal authority in making the changes.
Republican Brad Raffensperger, who as secretary of state is Georgia's top election official, has said that the election board's ""11th-hour"" changes would damage voter confidence and burden election workers.
States must certify their voting results - confirming the accurate tabulation of the votes cast - as part of the process of determining a presidential election's outcome.
Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in January 2021 in a failed bid to prevent Congress from certifying the voting results from November 2020 election. Democrats now are accusing Republicans in various states of seeking to delay or prevent certification of voting results unfavorable to Trump.

What to expect from Japan's Oct 27 general election,"TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Japan's general election on Sunday will be a test for new prime minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is seeking to solidify his position atop a scandal-plagued party.
His gamble to call a snap election after winning a close-fought contest last month to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) could backfire in a fluid election, however, as opinion polls show the party could cede seats to the opposition.

When watchmaker Quinn Lai heard Washington was closing its so-called de minimis rule,




Here are some key factors to watch:
WHAT'S AT STAKE?
Ishiba inherited a fractured party struggling to shake off a scandal over undocumented funds after predecessor Fumio Kishida cleared out tainted ministers, disbanded influential factions and stepped down himself, in a bid to regain public trust.
But Ishiba still appears to be fighting an uphill battle.
While some polls project the LDP and its coalition partner Komeito will maintain their majority, a weekend poll by the Asahi newspaper showed they may struggle, with the LDP potentially losing 50 of the 247 seats it now has.

If Ishiba misses his own target of retaining a majority for the ruling coalition, questions are likely to be asked about his capability as premier at a time of economic uncertainty and increasing tension with neighbours China, Russia and North Korea.
WHO ARE THE MAIN PARTIES?
The LDP has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war era, and holds a majority in the 465-seat lower house. Its long-time coalition partner is Komeito, a party backed by a large Buddhist lay group that has often lent crucial campaign support to the LDP.

Although the LDP's popularity hit a low of 25.5% in June – the lowest since it regained power in 2012 – it remains the most popular party in a fragmented political landscape, with backing from 35.1% of respondents in a mid-October poll by public broadcaster NHK.
While the LDP still has strong support, the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) is making inroads. The Asahi poll estimated the CDPJ could grab as many as 140 seats in the election, up from 98.

WHAT ARE THE TOP ISSUES?
The economy and inflation are critical for voters, the NHK poll showed, with the slush fund scandal also a concern.
In a sign of the pain of rising living costs, food and daily necessities topped the list of items on which the respondents said they increased spending from a year ago, a quarterly survey by the Bank of Japan showed in early October.
Ishiba has told ministers to draw up a fresh economic package to cushion the blow to households from the rising costs of living.

The opposition CDPJ has announced plans to increase welfare spending, including free university education.

"Harris, Trump barnstorm Michigan, spar over who has stamina","DETROIT/WATERFORD TOWNSHIP, Michigan, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Democrat Kamala Harris raised questions about Republican Donald Trump's physical stamina to serve effectively as president as the two rivals tore through the deadlocked battleground state of Michigan on Friday, with Trump lashing back about the energy he's shown on the campaign trail.
Harris, who turns 60 on Sunday, pressed the case to raise doubts about the 78-year-old Trump. Age had been an issue when President Joe Biden, 81, was still in the race, but had faded after he dropped his election bid.

'I'M NOT EVEN TIRED'
Trump, talking to reporters as he arrived in Detroit, rejected such talk. ""I've gone 48 days now without a rest,"" he said.
""I'm not even tired. I'm really exhilarated. You know why? We're killing her in the polls, because the American people don't want her.""
Polls in the election's most competitive states are effectively tied with just 18 days remaining until the election.
In a Fox & Friends interview, Trump also griped about negative television ads on Fox about him and said he would ask Rupert Murdoch, the founder of News Corp (NWSA.O), opens new tab and who also launched Fox News, to ensure such ads are not broadcast until Election Day on Nov. 5.

""I'm going to say, 'Rupert, please do it this way and then we're going to have a victory, cause everyone wants that,'"" Trump said.
Trump visited a campaign office in Hamtramck, where he heard praise from the Detroit suburb's first Muslim mayor, Amer Ghalib. Trump was seeking support from Arab Americans in Michigan disenchanted with Democrats, Harris and Biden over U.S. support for Israel in the Gaza conflict.

""We all ultimately want one thing. We want peace in the Middle East. We're going to get peace in the Middle East. It's going to happen very fast. It can happen with the right leadership in Washington,"" Trump said, without elaborating.
In Oakland County, Harris welcomed members of the Arab American community to her rally and touted prospects for peace in the aftermath of the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

MIC ISSUES
In the evening, Trump returned to Detroit, Michigan's largest city, for a rally after saying on Oct. 10 that the rest of the U.S. would turn into Detroit if Harris won.
There, Trump's microphone stopped working and the former president roamed around the stage for some 20 minutes.
""I won't pay the bill for this stupid company that rented us this crap,"" Trump said after the audio started working again. ""This is the worst mic I've ever had in my life.""
The dead-mic incident took place days after Trump stopped talking and swayed and bopped to his musical playlist at a Pennsylvania town hall event after two people in the audience fell ill.
Harris, after speaking in Grand Rapids, the heart of more conservative western Michigan, headed east to Lansing and then Oakland County, encompassing suburbs northwest of Detroit, on Friday night.
The Midwestern state has about 8.4 million voters and would bring the winner 15 Electoral College votes out of the 270 needed to win, which could be a decisive number. Harris and Trump are battling fiercely for the state's Arab American, senior, union and working-class voters.
Public and internal campaign polls show razor-thin margins for either Harris or Trump in Michigan and other battleground states. That is worrying Democrats.
Trump won Michigan by 11,000 votes in 2016. In 2020, Biden beat Trump in the state by 155,000 votes.
Harris is shifting the strategy of her whirlwind campaign to win over more Republicans and men of all races. She's also enlisting popular former first lady Michelle Obama, who will campaign for Harris in Michigan on Oct. 26.
""I understand why people are looking to shake things up,"" former President Barack Obama said at an Arizona campaign event in support of Harris on Friday. ""What I cannot understand is why anyone would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you.""
Nationally, Harris' edge has narrowed from a late September lead of 7 percentage points over Trump to just 3 points, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with high food and rent prices still worrying Americans and Trump amplifying fears related to migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border with increasingly extreme rhetoric.

Hurricane Helene, which killed more than 200 people across six states and caused billions of dollars in damage, has sparked questions on how it might impact voter turnout.
Harvey Neal, a 71-year-old retiree, voted at the lone early voting site in Hendersonville, North Carolina, as a steady stream of voters filed in and out of the center on Thursday morning.
Neal cast his vote for Harris. ""She's young, she's a Democrat,"" he said. ""And, you know, what's the alternative?""

Neal considers himself relatively fortunate following the hurricane as nothing hit his house, though he had been without power for four or five days.

Some of the state's hardest hit counties lean both Republican and Democratic. For instance, Buncombe County - home to the city of Asheville - supported President Joe Biden in the 2020 election versus Trump, while neighboring Yancey County favored Trump.
North Carolina's state elections board has spent weeks assessing storm damage to polling locations. On Thursday, 76 early voting sites were set to open to voters in the 25 western North Carolina counties listed in the federal disaster declaration. That compares to 80 planned before the storm.

Early voting has been the most popular way for North Carolinians to cast a ballot in both the 2020 and 2016 elections, according to the state. Early voting started on Tuesday in Georgia, another closely contested state that was hit by storm damage.
Still, near polling sites in western North Carolina were reminders of the destruction the region has faced, with trees uprooted and debris piled on the sides of roads. In Swannanoa, buildings still lay reduced to rubble and a house-sized chunk of the ground was caved in along a main street.
Gene Dickinson, a 75-year-old resident of Asheville, said he had been planning to vote for Trump this year but has been too busy helping run supplies to those in need since the hurricane to think about voting.
""With everything that's going on, I haven't even thought about that,"" he said outside of a FEMA recovery center. ""I've heard about it, but we don't have any TV or anything.""
In Burnsville, Tina Veitch, a 49-year-old graphic designer, said the road to her family's house was destroyed by the storm. But one of the reasons she has stayed in the area, instead of seeking refuge with family in Florida, is so she can vote.
She said on Wednesday that the process to vote by absentee ballot was too arduous, adding: ""The amount of hoops you have to jump through to just do it was not worth it ... So we were like, 'We're just going to stay 'til tomorrow at least and vote'.""

"Biden makes final campaign stop for Harris in Scranton, his childhood hometown","SCRANTON, Pennsylvania, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Barack Obama once said if there were no Scranton, Pennsylvania, there would be no Joe Biden.
The sitting president, whose term ends in January, returned to his childhood hometown on Saturday for a final campaign stop in support of Vice President Kamala Harris, seeking to use his sway in a critical part of an important swing state to help her beat his onetime rival, Republican Donald Trump, in Tuesday's election.

Scranton has a storied history for Biden, and if he were still at the top of the Democratic ticket, a stop here would likely be seen as a full-circle moment for his final campaign.
Instead it was Biden's swan song of sorts for his No. 2, and a muted one at that.
The president rallied union workers, a constituency with whom he is popular, at a small hall in the town where he grew up before his family moved to Delaware, where he would launch his more than 50-year political career.

""I'm so proud to be back,"" Biden said, diving into familiar remarks about his and Harris' support for unions, his pride in having been the first president to walk a picket line, and their efforts to restore pensions.
""Don't forget where you came from,"" he said to applause, warning of the ramifications if Trump is elected and does away with the Affordable Care Act healthcare program, which was Obama's signature achievement.

Biden used colorful language when describing what he would like to do to those who would turn back his legislative accomplishments with a reference to his younger days in Scranton.
""I'm serious. These are the kind of guys you'd like to smack in the ass,"" he said.
Biden told the crowd he would not have picked Harris as vice president if she didn't share his views about hard-working Americans.
""We made a lot of progress, and Kamala will build on that progress,"" he said. ""We need to elect Kamala as president.""

Biden, who stepped aside as the Democratic Party's standard bearer in July following a disastrous debate performance against Trump, has not been a regular feature on the campaign trail for Harris since she ascended to the top of the ticket.
They held a handful of early events, both official and campaign-related, as she energized demoralized Democrats in the summer. But Biden's former campaign largely has left him in the shadows since, amid concerns about his age, penchant for gaffes, and low approval ratings with the American public.

The wisdom of that strategy was highlighted earlier this week when Biden's call with a Latino group in which he referred to a Trump supporter or supporters as &quot;garbage&quot; partially overshadowed Harris' well-received closing argument speech to tens of thousands of supporters in Washington. Biden later clarified his remarks, but the episode was an unwelcome one for Harris and her team in the final stretch of the race.
It was not enough, however, for them to ask Biden to eschew his stop in Pennsylvania, where he spoke at a union get-out-the-vote meeting with Carpenters Local 445, standing in front of a wall of signs that said ""Harris for President"" and ""Thank you, Joe.""

Texas sues US over noncitizen voting allegations,"Oct 22 (Reuters) - Texas's Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Tuesday, saying the federal government was not providing the help it needed in assessing the citizenship status of some of its registered voters.
The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas accuses the Biden administration and specifically the Department of Homeland Security of refusing to help it determine the citizenship status of 450,000 of the 17.9 million registered voters in the state.

It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in U.S. federal elections and state and private reviews have turned up very few instances of them doing so. Still, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his allies have argued that large numbers of noncitizens could vote in the Nov. 5 election, when he faces Democrat Kamala Harris.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump has falsely claimed that his 2020 loss to Biden resulted from widespread voter fraud.
Paxton's office said he sent a letter earlier this month asking the U.S. government to verify the citizenship status of people who may be unlawfully registered to vote in Texas by Oct. 19. His office said he proceeded with a lawsuit when his request was not answered.
His office said there were nearly half a million voters whose citizenship status has not been verified but acknowledged that the majority of those voters were likely citizens and hence eligible to vote.

""While the majority of the voters on the list are likely citizens who are eligible to vote, Texans have no way of knowing whether or not any of the voters on the list are non-citizens who are ineligible to vote without additional information,"" his office said.

"US states warn officials: Delaying, tampering with vote could bring criminal charges","Oct 18 (Reuters) - Some U.S. states are sending strong signals to county and local officials who might be tempted to intervene illegally in the Nov. 5 election or refuse to certify results: Fail to do your duty and risk criminal charges or hefty financial penalties.
In at least five of the seven battleground states that could determine whether the next U.S. president is Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump, top election and law enforcement officials have investigated, indicted and even jailed officials who tried to interfere with the vote or delay certification of results, a necessary but largely ceremonial step.

he thought that was the end for his business.




County officials have also been warned that failing to certify results on time could force their local governments to foot the bill for unnecessary audits or recounts.
The increased oversight of local election officials is aimed at preventing unfounded claims of fraud from slowing the certification of election results, which in turn could interfere with Congress's certification of the presidential election results in a highly-charged partisan atmosphere.

Four years after Trump tried to overturn his 2020 defeat, officials in swing states Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as in solidly Democratic Colorado, said they have become far more adept at handling those who overstep their authority.
With Trump still repeating false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and that he will lose in November only through fraud, ensuring the election process goes smoothly in each state is critical. States that fail to certify results by certain deadlines could be left out of the state-by-state Electoral College process that formally determines the winners of U.S. presidential elections.

""The law is clear and we won't tolerate anyone not following it for any reason,"" Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in an interview. ""There are times and places for challenging election results. The certification process is not one of them.""
PENNSYLVANIA WARNS OF MISDEMEANOR CHARGES
The biggest of the swing states, Pennsylvania, has already overruled a county official who tried to prevent the use in her district of drop boxes, where early voters can deposit their mail-in ballots.

Luzerne County Manager Romilda Crocamo, a Democrat appointed by the Republican-majority county council, in September scrapped plans to deploy drop boxes, citing concerns about safety. The decision came shortly after the Republican National Committee threatened to sue the county if it did not assure the security of the boxes.
State Attorney General Michelle Henry, in an Oct. 3 letter, warned Crocamo that only the county elections board could decide whether to deploy drop boxes under state law and that if Crocamo failed to comply she could face criminal misdemeanor charges punishable by fines and up to a year in prison.

The county relented shortly afterward.
Henry, a former Republican appointed to her role last year by the state's Democratic governor, said in an interview that her office would continue to enforce election laws.
""We certainly are ready,"" Henry said. ""Should anyone not comply with the statutes, we will investigate that and there will be consequences ... There's both criminal and civil actions that could be taken to maintain the integrity of the process.""
Crocamo's attorney, Mark Cedrone, said the threat of an RNC lawsuit played no role in his client's initial decision to oppose the use of drop boxes. She was instead influenced by activist groups that have openly targeted what some refer to as the county's ""cheat"" boxes for action, Cedrone said, adding that Crocamo remains deeply concerned about safety.
WISCONSIN INVESTIGATES MAYOR
The criminal division of the Wisconsin Justice Department is investigating Wausau Mayor Doug Diny for removing a locked, empty drop box from outside City Hall in September. Diny, a nonpartisan conservative backed by Republicans, told reporters at the time that he did not feel the box was secure where the city clerk had placed it.
Diny, who did not respond to queries seeking comment, shrugged off a July Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that allowed placement of drop boxes by municipal clerks.
""The Supreme Court interprets the law - this is my logic - does not make the law, does not make state statutes, does not make state ordinances,"" Diny explained this month at a meeting of the Wausau Common Council.
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, declined to comment specifically on the Diny investigation but said his office would enforce election laws.
""It's our expectation that election officials will follow the law,"" Kaul said in an interview. ""But if we receive concerns that that won't be the case, we're prepared to act.""
MICHIGAN: FELONY CHARGES, POTENTIAL FISCAL PENALTIES
In Michigan's Macomb County, where Republicans unsuccessfully sued to overturn the 2020 election results, three assistant clerks in the city of St. Clair Shores face felony charges for allegedly allowing four residents to vote twice in the state's Aug. 6 congressional and state primary election.
Democratic Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed charges punishable by up to five years in prison against all seven.
""Despite common talking points by those who seek to instill doubt in our election process, double voting in Michigan is extremely rare,"" Nessel said in a statement. ""Nevertheless, the fact that four incidents occurred in a municipality of this size raised significant concerns.""
The charges have raised objections in St. Clair Shores.
""In my opinion, this is not voter fraud. This is, to me, political theater,"" Kip Walby, the city's nonpartisan mayor, told a city council meeting at which he called on Nessel to drop the charges.
Walby told Reuters that three of the accused are not assistant clerks but ""part-time seasonal election workers,"" two of whom worked only on the day of the election.
Nessel spokesperson Kimberly Bush said the mayor was ""grandstanding in defense of illegal activity"" and that the attorney general would continue to take election violations seriously.
Michigan authorities have taken a different tack against officials who refuse to certify elections by leveraging state election laws that were tightened in the aftermath of 2020.
Delta County canvass board members Bonnie Hakkola and LeeAnne Oman, both Republicans, voted against certification of a local recall election on May 14, after seeing nearly identical voting margins in three different races.
""Because of that, they felt something was 'off' and couldn't in good conscience certify the election,"" Delta County Clerk Nancy Przewrocki said in an email.
State authorities responded two days later.
""County canvassers have a clear and nondiscretionary duty to certify election results,"" state elections director Jonathan Brater told them in a May 16 letter. ""All costs associated with the state canvass ... will be the responsibility of the county.""
The next day, the board met again and certified the results. This time, Oman, an alternate, was replaced by a full-time board member who had been absent on May 14. Hakkola abstained but read from a prepared statement expressing her concerns. Both later resigned.
""I am being coerced into signing a document,"" Hakkola said. ""I am doing my best to protect the votes of the citizens of Delta County and to ensure free and fair elections by bringing transparency and reassurance to all Delta County citizens.""
Przewrocki said a hand-count of ballots matched the tabulator exactly in an audit performed after certification.
Oman said in an interview that she and Hakkola wanted a hand recount to verify the results before certification but the request was denied. According to the state recount manual, county election results must be certified before a recount can occur.
""After it's certified, it's out of our hands. We don't have any authority other than our signature,"" Oman said. ""The request should have been granted. It shouldn't have made national news.""
ARIZONA: FELONY CHARGES
Two Republican officials from Arizona's Cochise County face felony election interference charges, alleging they delayed the canvass of votes in the 2022 elections.
Cochise County supervisors Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd voted to delay canvassing, despite multiple warnings that missing the Nov. 28 state deadline would amount breaking the law, court documents show. They expressed doubts about the accuracy of voting machines. Prosecutors say the delay interfered with a statewide canvass.
Judd and Crosby are due to stand trial in January on felony charges punishable by up to 2-1/2 years in prison. They have pleaded not guilty.
But Judd is scheduled for a court status conference involving a possible change of plea on Monday.
Judd said in an August interview that she has no concerns about the 2024 election in Cochise County: ""I'm positive about this election, feeling like things are going to be just fine.""
Secretary of State Adrian Fontes and Attorney General Kris Mayes, both Democrats, have made it clear publicly that state election laws will be enforced going forward.
""We have spoken very clearly with clerks and chief judges in these jurisdictions about what the process should be and the speed with which they should act,"" Fontes told reporters. ""I don't anticipate any of these shenanigans.""
Nearly a year ago, Mayes also warned supervisors in Mohave County not to violate state law by directing the local election board to count 2024 results by hand instead by voting machine. In a letter, she said the supervisors could be held liable for the cost of the illegal hand count and face felony and misdemeanor charges.
NEVADA: POSSIBLE PROSECUTION, FORFEITURE OF OFFICE
In Nevada, the secretary of state, attorney general and a district attorney intervened to swiftly resolve an impasse over a county’s certification of a primary election results.
The Washoe County Board of Commissioners in July voted 3-2 to not certify the results of a June primary election recount, with several commissioners saying there were anomalies that merited further investigation.
Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar asked the state’s supreme court to force the commissioners to certify, saying their role in the election was purely ministerial and gave them no discretion to hold up results.
The commission reversed course before the case could be decided, with two holdout commissioners changing their votes after being told they could face criminal penalties or be stripped of office if they refused to certify.
Commissioner Mike Clark, a Republican, said during a July 16 hearing that he was changing his vote with “heavy heart” because he was told by the Washoe County prosecutors and Nevada Attorney General’s Office that he was required to certify.
“I have been told that a failure to vote to certify this election could subject me to criminal prosecution and forfeiture of office,” Clark said.
COLORADO: NINE YEARS IN PRISON
In one of the starkest examples, Republican former Mesa County, Colorado, Clerk Tina Peters was sentenced to nine years in prison this month, after being convicted of illegally tampering with voting machines in 2020.
Peters, who repeated Trump's falsehoods that the 2020 election was stolen, has denied wrongdoing and insisted her actions were intended to help the people of her county.
Judge Matthew Barrett said Peters had abused her position and violated her oath of office.
""You are no hero,"" Barrett said as he sentenced her. ""You're a charlatan who used, and is still using, your prior position in office to peddle a snake oil that's been proven to be junk time and time again.""

At least two polling sites targeted by the hoax bomb threats in Georgia were briefly evacuated.
The two locations, in Fulton County, both re-opened after about 30 minutes, officials said, and the county was seeking a court order to extend the locations' voting hours past the statewide 7 p.m. deadline.

Police in DeKalb County, Georgia - another Democratic stronghold - later responded to bomb threats at eight locations, according to a county press release. Six of the locations were polling places and were evacuated. County officials were seeking an emergency order extending opening times at the voting sites.
DeKalb County police later said no bombs were found at the six voting sites.
A senior official in Raffensperger's office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Georgia bomb hoaxes were sent from email addresses that had been used by Russians trying to interfere in previous U.S. elections.
The threats were sent to U.S. media and polling locations, the official said. ""It's a likelihood it's Russia,"" the official said.
Adrian Fontes, the Arizona secretary of state, a Democrat who is the chief election official in the swing state, said four fake bomb threats had been delivered to polling sites in Navajo County, located in the northeastern part of the state and which includes three Native American tribes.
""Vladimir Putin is being a prick,"" Fontes told Reuters.
Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump are locked in a tight race to win the White House. Opinion polls suggest the contest is too close to call.
A judge in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, extended voting hours to 9:00 p.m. after a bomb threat at a vote-counting site disrupted the process.
Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, said on Tuesday night multiple bomb threats had been investigated and none were found to be credible. He did not mention Russia.
The phony bomb threats mark the latest in a string of examples of alleged interference by the Russians in the 2024 election.
On Nov. 1, U.S. intelligence officials warned that Russian actors manufactured a video that falsely depicted Haitians illegally casting ballots in Georgia. Intelligence officials also found that the Russians created a separate phony video that falsely accused someone associated with the Harris presidential ticket of taking a bribe from an entertainer.
U.S. intelligence officials have also accused Russia of interfering in previous U.S. presidential elections, especially the 2016 race which Trump won against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
