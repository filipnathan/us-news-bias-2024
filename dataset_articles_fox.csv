Trump vows to lead ‘golden age of America’ in victory speech: 'Fix everything',"President-elect Trump addressed his supporters in the nation early Wednesday morning after earning more than 270 electoral votes, vowing he will lead the ""golden age of America"" after launching the ""greatest political movement of all time."" ""This was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There's never been anything like this in this country, and maybe beyond. And now it's going to reach a new level of importance because we're going to help our country heal,"" Trump said just before 2:30 a.m. on Wednesday. ""We're going to help our country heal. We have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly. We're going to fix our borders. We're going to fix everything about our country, and we've made history for a reason tonight. And the reason is going to be just that. We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,"" he added to cheers from the crowd. Trump took the stage after Fox News projected he would win the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, as well as Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina. He notched more than 270 electoral votes around 1:45 a.m., officially defeating Harris. Trump said that he will lead the ""golden age of America"" upon his inauguration. ""Every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family and your future. Every single day, I will be fighting for you. And with every breath in my body, I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve. This will truly be the golden age of America. That's what we have to have. This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again,"" he said. Throughout the election cycle, Pennsylvania was seen as the state that would likely determine the overall outcome of the election, as both campaigns repeatedly traveled throughout the Keystone State to build support. Georgia was another hard-fought state for both campaigns, and where Trump was ultimately projected victorious on Tuesday evening. Vice President-elect JD Vance also addressed the crowds on Wednesday morning, thanking Trump for an ""incredible journey."" ""I appreciate you allowing me to join you on this incredible journey. I thank you for the trust, the place to me. And I think that we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America. Okay. And under President Trump's leadership, we're never going to stop fighting for you, for your dreams, for the future of your children. And after the greatest political comeback in American history, we're going to lead the greatest economic comeback in American history. Under Donald Trump's leadership,"" he said. Trump was flanked by his family while addressing his supporters, including former first lady Melania Trump and son Barron Trump. The president-elect invited UFC CEO Dana White to speak onstage, and gave shout-outs to billionaire Elon Musk, as well as professional golfer Bryson Dechambeau. ""We will make America safe, strong, prosperous, powerful and free again. And I'm asking every citizen all across our land to join me in this noble and righteous endeavor,"" Trump said. The president-elect noted that after winning North Carolina, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, he still has the opportunity to win other states such as Arizona and Michigan. ""In addition to having won the battleground states of North Carolina, and I love these places, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, we are now winning in Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Alaska, which would result in us carrying at least 315 electoral votes,"" he said. ""We also have won the popular vote,"" he added. Trump's remarks followed the Harris-Walz campaign packing it up for the evening, with campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon encouraging supporters to go home ""get some sleep"" as votes began to show Trump in the lead. Harris skipped addressing her supporters, opting to instead speak to voters and the nation on Wednesday. The campaign’s co-chair, Cedric Richmond, instead delivered brief remarks. ""We still have votes to count, we still have states that have not been called yet. We will continue overnight to fight to make sure that every vote is counted, that every voice has spoken. So you won't hear from the vice president tonight. But you will hear from her tomorrow,"" Richmond said.",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-lead-golden-age-america-victory-speech-fix-everything
Harris formally concedes one day after Trump's sweeping victory,"Vice President Kamala Harris, in her first public comments since losing the 2024 White House race to former President Trump, urged supporters to ""accept the results."" But Harris on Wednesday afternoon emphasized that ""while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign."" The vice president spoke at Howard University, her alma mater, where her campaign held a large election night watch party. Harris never addressed the crowd on Tuesday night, as initial optimism about the election turned dour as the clock struck past midnight. Trump ended up winning a sweeping electoral and popular vote victory over Harris, as Republicans won back the Senate for the first time in four years. Meanwhile, control of the House was still up for grabs on the day after the election.The vice president, who walked to the podium one last time to Beyonce's ""Freedom,"" the song that had become Harris' unofficial anthem, noted near the top of her roughly 12-minute address that ""my heart is full today."" ""The outcome of this election is not what we hoped, not what we fought, not what we voted for,"" she said. ""But hear when I say… the light of America’s promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.""The vice president also seemed to take aim at Trump, who for four years has blamed his 2020 White House loss to President Biden on unproven claims of a ""rigged election"" and who repeatedly tried unsuccessfully to overturn the results.  ""Earlier today I spoke with President-elect Trump and congratulated him on his victory,"" Harris said. ""I also told him we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power."" She emphasized that ""a fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results… anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it."" The vice president also stressed that ""we owe loyalty not to a president or a party but to the Constitution of the United States."" Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and U.S. senator, ran unsuccessfully for the 2020 presidential nomination. But Biden named his primary rival as his running mate and the two have spent the past four years steering the nation. Harris, for most of the 2024 election cycle, was the dutiful running mate as Biden bid for a second four-year term in the White House. But everything changed in late June, due to Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump.The 81-year-old Biden's halting and stumbling delivery fueled questions about his physical and mental ability to serve another four years in the White House. And it sparked calls from within the Democratic Party for Biden to drop out of the White House race. The president finally succumbed to the pressure and on July 21, in a blockbuster announcement that rocked the 2024 election, Biden ended his bid and endorsed his vice president. The Democratic Party quickly coalesced around Harris, who instantly enjoyed a jump in the polls and a massive surge in fundraising. The Harris honeymoon continued through the late August Democratic National Convention and into September, when most pundits declared her the winner of the one and only presidential debate between her and Trump. But as the calendar moved from September into October, Trump appeared to regain his footing, and public opinion surveys indicated the former president gaining momentum. Then, in the final days of the campaign, the mood and the vibe appeared to switch again, this time to Harris, who closed out her White House bid on a positive note and didn't mention Trump's name during the last 48 hours leading up to Election Day. Meanwhile, Trump struck a more negative and angrier tone on the campaign trail as he crisscrossed the key battleground states in the stretch run. Harris, in her concession speech on Wednesday, appeared to paint a contrast with Trump. ""I am so proud of the race we ran and the way we ran … over the 107 days of this campaign,"" Harris said. ""We have been intentional about building community and building coalitions, bringing people together."" But the former president ended up with a sweeping victory, as Americans returned him to the White House. Preliminary data from the Fox News Voter Analysis of the 2024 election pointed to a political realignment, as it spotlighted that Trump ran up the score with his MAGA base while narrowing traditional Democratic advantages among Black, Hispanic and young voters.Harris came close in her bid to become the first woman elected to the presidency, but was unable to make enough gains in the ideological middle of the electorate to offset defections among groups that traditionally vote Democratic. The Fox News Voter Analysis is a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide which highlights the 2024 campaign’s key dynamics. Just as damaging: Harris wasn't able to escape the massive unpopularity of the Biden/Harris administration, where polls indicated that nearly three quarters of voters said the country was on the wrong track. The Fox News Voter Analysis spotlighted that in an election where voters across the nation wanted change, they chose Trump’s outsider appeal over Harris’ promise to ""turn the page"" on the Trump era.",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-gives-concession-speech-one-day-after-trumps-sweeping-victory
Harris world blame game begins after crushing loss to Trump,"President-elect Trump’s historic victory over Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday has surrogates of the Democratic candidate pointing fingers and laying blame for the defeat — even before Harris officially concedes. Harris-Walz surrogate Lindy Li spoke to Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich at Howard University, Harris’ alma mater, in Washington, D.C., saying that the Harris team wasn’t ""expecting a blowout at all."" ""The blame game has started,"" said Li, a member of Harris' National Finance Committee and Pennsylvania commissioner. Li said that Harris’ pick for vice president, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, may not have been the right choice to carry the ""blue wall"" states against the Trump-Vance ticket. ""One of the things that are top of mind is the choice of Tim Walz as vice presidential candidate,"" Li said. ""A lot of people are saying tonight that it should have been Josh Shapiro. Frankly, people have been saying that for months."" ""I know a lot of people are probably wondering tonight what would have happened had Shapiro been on the ticket,"" Li continued. ""And not only in terms of Pennsylvania. He's famously a moderate. So that would have signaled to the American people that she is not the San Francisco liberal that Trump said she was."" Li added that she was ""not sure how much Tim Walz contributed to the ticket"" as the campaign was forced into ""cleaning up"" the governor’s ""laundry list"" of gaffes. ""In the eyes of the American people, he was the governor who oversaw the protests in Minnesota and probably let it go on longer than he should have. So that has been seared in the minds of American people,"" she said. ""And also, ideally, you don't say on national TV that you're a knucklehead,"" Li said, referring to a moment during the Vice Presidential Debate in which Walz was forced to correct a misstatement that he had been in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. ""I just think that's his very baseline stuff, like Politics 101."" Li noted that Harris' attempt to present herself as ""a unifier"" may have ""undermined her goal"" of getting Biden supporters ""who were maybe still understandably upset that their leader was unceremoniously, basically pushed aside."" Harris appearance on ABC’s ""The View"" may also have been a missed opportunity to show how a Harris administration would not have just been a repeat of Biden’s four years, according to Li. ""She knows a mistake was to say on ‘The View’ that she couldn't think of a single thing that she would do differently from the Biden administration,"" Li said. ""That was the opener for her to show Americans that she's going to get tough on the border, that she's going to take drastic measures to bring down inflation. That was her chance."" Li also pointed to concerns about the leadership of Harris’ Pennsylvania team making poor staffing decisions that ultimately led to muddled campaign messaging. ""[Harris] heard us. We raised serious concerns about the Pennsylvania campaign's leadership,"" Li said. ""She actually installed someone on her own people in the final weeks of the campaign, but I fear it was too late. … We should have people who deeply understand, intimately understand the contours of the state rather than out-of-state operatives who move from campaign to campaign."" Harris did not speak to supporters who gathered at her alma mater overnight. She is expected to speak later Wednesday.",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-world-blame-game-begins-after-crushing-loss-trump
Fox News projects Donald Trump defeats Kamala Harris to become 47th president of the United States,"The Fox News Decision Desk projects former President Trump has defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in a stunning victory, delivering him a second term in the White House after a historic election cycle filled with unprecedented twists and turns and two attempts on his life. Trump defeated Vice President Harris, who entered this race just over 100 days ago after President Biden, who won the Democratic primaries, was convinced to stand down. Trump was projected to have breached the 270 electoral vote threshold after stunning wins in the battleground states of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Georgia. Trump's comeback win was called by Fox News after it projected that he had won Wisconsin, a state he narrowly lost in 2020. ""I want to thank you all very much. This is great. These are our friends. We have thousands of friends in this incredible movement. This is a movement like nobody's ever seen before,"" Trump said during early morning remarks at a victory celebration in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""I believe, the greatest political movement of all time."" Trump said that this was going to be the ""golden age of America,"" thanking supporters for reelecting him. ""I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected the 47th president,"" he said. ""And every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family and your future. Every single day. I will be fighting for you. And with every breath in my body, I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve."" This will truly be the golden age of America — Donald Trump. Trump will be the only president to serve two nonconsecutive terms other than Grover Cleveland who was elected in 1884 and again in 1892. Trump was first elected president in 2016, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and vowing to ""Make America Great Again."" He lost re-election to President Biden in 2020 during the global coronavirus pandemic but re-claimed the White House in 2024 after a nearly two-year campaign, vowing to ""Make America Great Once Again."" Pennsylvania was one of the most important states Trump twon, with Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign having identified it as one of three Rust Belt states on its ""clearest path to 270 electoral votes."" The once and future president also took Georgia, no doubt a sweet victory for him after a bitter, narrow loss there in 2020. Trump praised his decision of choosing Vice President-elect JD Vance as his running mate, saying that they are going to have ""four great years."" ""He turned out to be a good choice. I took a little heat at the beginning, but I knew in my brain that he was a good one. About as good as it gets,"" he said. ""And we love the family. And we're going to have a great four years, and we're going to turn our country around, making something very special,"" he said. Trump formally announced his presidential campaign on Nov. 15, 2022 – just days after the midterm elections. Trump campaigned for a second term on the record of his first and focused on the failures of the Biden-Harris administration. The former president was able to point to the reversal of some of his key policies as reasons why inflation rose and the U.S. border crisis worsened. Trump faced a crowded GOP primary field, but emerged as the frontrunner yet again, easily defeating his opponents – all of whom eventually endorsed him to be the 47th President of the United States – and winning each primary contest. Until July, Trump was running against Biden, who was seeking re-election for a second term. But the two debated for the first time in June, and weeks later, after a disastrous debate performance, Biden was pressured by Democrat insiders to suspend his presidential bid. Biden made the announcement in a social media post and endorsed Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee in his place, moving his vice president to the top of the ticket. The decision for Biden to drop out of the race came just days after the Republican National Convention (RNC) finished, and after Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, formally accepted the GOP nomination. But Trump, just days before accepting the Republican nomination, survived an assassination attempt at a rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. During the event, Trump was showing off a chart highlighting how illegal immigration skyrocketed under the Biden-Harris administration. As he turned toward the chart, he was hit by a bullet that pierced the upper part of his right ear by the now-deceased would-be-assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks. Trump credits the chart for saving his life. But weeks later, in September, another would-be-assassin hid himself in the bushes at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. The gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh, had an AK-47-style rifle pointing through the fence toward Trump as he was golfing. Trump was rushed off the golf course by U.S. Secret Service agents unharmed. Just a day later, Trump told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that the ""rhetoric"" of Biden, Harris and the Democrats was to blame. ""He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,"" Trump said of the gunman. ""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country – both from the inside and out."" The general election showcased two very different visions for the future of the United States of America. The Trump campaign touted pro-growth, America first economic policies, securing the border, ending inflation, and restoring ""peace through strength"" as part of the president's plan. The Trump campaign’s closing message was: ""Harris broke it. Trump will fix it."" In the final weeks of the campaign, Trump traveled to Pennsylvania to work at a McDonald's drive-thru window as a fry cook in a jab at Harris, who previously claimed that she worked at the fast-food chain. Meanwhile, Harris campaigned that Trump was a threat to democracy and warned supporters that he would sign a national abortion ban – something Trump repeatedly denied. As for the rhetoric, it never quite fizzled. Trump held a massive, sold-out campaign rally just a week before Election Day at Madison Square Garden in traditionally blue New York City. Democrats, including Harris, later likened Trump to ""Hitler."" And less than a week before Election Day, Biden described Trump supporters as ""garbage."" Trump landed key endorsements from top Republicans during his bid for the White House but also created unlikely allies, like former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Trump also drew support from top business leaders like Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick. Lutnick told Fox News Digital that many Wall Street leaders had privately committed their support to Trump. Trump’s victory comes after years of what his campaign called a ""weaponization"" of the Justice Department. Trump’s post-presidential life and third campaign was reminiscent of his days in the Oval Office, marred by investigations, which the former president and his allies said were just part of an effort by his political opponents to prevent him from running for re-election in 2024. Trump, who was the first president in U.S. history to be impeached and acquitted twice, was also the first president to be indicted, not just once, but four times over. Just days after announcing his re-election bid in November 2022, Biden Attorney General Merrick Garland tapped former DOJ official Jack Smith as special counsel. The appointment came several months after the FBI conducted an unprecedented raid on Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, claiming he improperly retained classified records from his presidency. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges stemming from that probe. The case was eventually tossed completely by a federal judge in Florida, who ruled that Smith was improperly and unlawfully appointed as special counsel. Smith also took over an investigation into alleged 2020 election interference. Trump also pleaded not guilty, but his attorneys took the fight to the U.S. Supreme Court to argue on the basis of presidential immunity. The high court ruled that Trump was immune from prosecution for official presidential acts, forcing Smith to file a new indictment. Trump pleaded not guilty to those new charges as well. Trump attorneys are now seeking to have the election interference charges dropped in Washington, D.C., similarly alleging that Smith was appointed unlawfully. But that case wasn’t the first Trump-related Supreme Court ruling this election cycle. Colorado, attempting to use the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, sought to remove Trump from the 2024 primary ballot, but the Supreme Court sided unanimously with the former president, impacting efforts in several other states to do the same. In 2023, Trump was charged by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg with allegedly falsifying business records. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges but sat through an unprecedented six-week criminal trial in New York City this spring. The jury found him guilty. Trump appealed the ruling, and the judge presiding over the case set his sentencing date for after the election. Trump also sat inside a courtroom in the fall of 2023 for a civil fraud trial stemming from a lawsuit brought against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Judge Arthur Engoron demanded Trump pay more than $450 million. But a New York appeals court appeared open-minded and receptive in September to reversing or reducing that judgment. Trump has also appealed a ruling to pay E. Jean Carroll more than $80 million in a defamation suit. As president, Trump said Carroll was lying about allegations of sexual assault. This year, a New York jury ruled that he defamed Carroll’s character in denying the allegations and defending himself. And in Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump in her election interference case. He pleaded not guilty but was booked and had his mugshot taken – a photo his campaign used throughout the election cycle to illustrate the ""lawfare"" used against him. A Georgia judge tossed a number of charges against Trump, and the case is on hold. The future of the cases and charges hang in limbo, as the president-elect will have the power to pardon himself once sworn in. But Trump, through all of the unprecedented legal challenges, took every opportunity to campaign. After hours in court this spring, Trump delivered pizzas to the New York City Fire Department. Trump told his supporters he thought the prosecutions would have ""the reverse effect"" on his presidential bid – and he was apparently right.

Trump thanks Biden for 'smooth transition' during White House meeting,"President-elect Trump and President Biden both pledged a smooth transition between administrations as they met at the White House on Wednesday morning. ""I look forward… to having a smooth transition. We'll do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, what you need,"" President Biden said as cameras and reporters were briefly allowed in the Oval Office for the meeting. Speaking second, Trump emphasized that ""politics is tough and in many cases it’s not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today."" ""I appreciate very much the transition that's so smooth. It will be as smooth as it can get, and I very much appreciate that,"" the former and future president added. Trump returned to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue just over a week after his sweeping election victory as he made his first stop back at the White House in nearly four years. He arrived at the White House at the invitation of Biden, the politician he knocked out of the 2024 presidential race. For Biden — who ended his own re-election bid in July, a month after his disastrous debate performance against Trump reignited questions over whether the 81-year-old president was physically and mentally up for another four years in the White House and sparked calls for him to drop out of the race — the meeting with his predecessor and now successor was likely awkward. Trump spent years verbally eviscerating Biden and his performance in the White House. And even after Biden ended his re-election bid, Trump continued to slam the president and his successor atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris. And Biden, for a couple of years, has labeled Trump a threat to the nation's democracy. But Biden, a traditionalist, wants to ensure a smooth transition between administrations. Biden's offer to Trump to visit the White House was an invitation he himself was never accorded. Four years ago, in the wake of his election defeat at the hands of Biden, Trump refused to concede and tried unsuccessfully to overturn the results. Breaking with longstanding tradition, Trump didn't invite Biden to the White House. And two weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters aiming to upend congressional certification of Biden's Electoral College victory, Trump left Washington ahead of the presidential inauguration of his successor, becoming the first sitting president in a century and a half to skip out on a successor's inauguration. ""President Biden met with President-elect Trump for approximately two hours in the Oval Office. White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and incoming Chief of Staff Susie Wiles joined the meeting,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday. ""It was a substantive meeting and exchange of views. They discussed important national security and domestic policy issues facing the nation and the world. ""President Biden also raised important items on Congress's to-do list for the lame duck session, including funding the government and providing the disaster supplemental funding the president requested,"" she continued. ""Finally, the president reiterated what he said to the president elect the day after the election and to the American people in the Rose Garden just last week – we will have an orderly transition and a peaceful transition of power."" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan added that ""President Biden reinforced his view that the United States standing with Ukraine on an ongoing basis is in our national security interest, and it's in our national security interest because a strong Europe, a stable Europe, standing up to aggressors and dictators and pushing back against their aggression is vital to ensuring that we don't end up getting dragged directly into a war, which has happened obviously twice in the 20th century on the European continent."" A veteran political scientist pointed to the significance of the meeting. ""President Biden's decision to welcome President-elect Trump to the White House is a tribute to normalcy in the presidential transition process. What was denied to Joe Biden following his election is being restored to Biden's credit,"" veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance told Fox News. Lesperance, the president of New Hampshire-based New England College, called the invitation by Biden "" a remarkable gesture in that it legitimizes Trump's return to power by the nation's leading Democrat and, hopefully, will be met with a commitment to orderly transitions in the future."" The meeting was the first between Biden and Trump since they faced off in Atlanta on June 27 in their one and only debate. The two presidents — along with Harris and Trump's running mate and now vice president-elect, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, — also stood next to each other on Sept. 11 in New York City's Lower Manhattan at ceremonies for the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This was Trump's second meeting at the White House with a departing president. Eight years ago, after defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump sat down at the White House with President Obama, who was finishing up his second term steering the nation. ""We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed. Because, if you succeed, then the country succeeds,"" Obama told Trump at the time. While a tradition, the meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents is not mandated.",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-thanks-biden-smooth-transition-during-white-house-meeting
Fox News Voter Analysis: How Trump regained the White House,"After a bitterly contested presidential campaign full of unprecedented twists and turns, voters returned Donald Trump to the White House after four years out of power. In an election where voters across the country wanted change, they chose Trump’s outsider appeal over Kamala Harris’ promise to ""turn the page"" on the Trump era.  Trump’s victory was powered by his strength on the economy and immigration – two of voters’ top concerns. He was seen as a stronger leader than Harris in a time of turmoil, and voters remembered his presidency more fondly than their evaluations of the current administration. Trump ran up the score with his base while narrowing traditional Democratic advantages among Black, Hispanic, and young voters.  Harris came close in her bid to become the first woman elected to the presidency but was unable to make enough gains in the ideological middle of the electorate to offset defections among groups that traditionally vote Democratic. Preliminary data from the Fox News Voter Analysis, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide, highlights the campaign’s key dynamics. Voters headed to the polls believing the country was on the wrong track (70%, up from 60% who felt that way four years ago) and seeking something different: most wanted a change in how the country is run, with roughly a quarter seeking complete and total upheaval.  Those seeking complete change in the country’s affairs voted for the former president by a wide margin.  Voters’ frustrations with Joe Biden’s administration were a drag on Harris’ candidacy, as nearly 6 in 10 disapproved of the job Biden has done.  Voters had rosier recollections of Trump’s time in office, with half approving of the job he did as president. Four years ago, 47% approved of the job Trump had done.  This desire for change was coupled with split views on the role of government. Slightly more than half felt the government should be doing more to solve the country’s problems, a modest decline from 2020 (57%). Some 45% felt the government was doing too many things better left to the private sector. The nation’s deep divides – by gender, education, and area of residence – were on vivid display. Men backed Trump by 10 points, while women went for Harris by 8 points. The 18-point gender gap was a touch wider than 2020 (17 points).  In 2020, Trump won men by 5 points and Biden won women by 12.  This divide was readily apparent in views of societal gains for women. Some 4 in 10 Trump supporters (43%) were concerned that society’s focus on gains for women had come at the expense of men; just 14% of Harris felt that way. Overall, 29% were concerned.  Voters without a college degree went for Trump by 12 points; college-educated voters went for Harris by 15 points. Harris’ showing among college-educated voters was 1 point worse than Biden’s 2020 showing among college-educated voters, while Trump bettered his 2020 numbers among noncollege voters by 4 points. Trump had a particular advantage among White voters without a degree (+29 points), thanks in large part to his 38-point edge among noncollege White men.  Harris won college-educated Whites by 8 points and college-educated White women by 16 points – both in the ballpark of Biden’s 2020 margins (+7 points and +21 points, respectively).  Overall, White voters backed Trump by 12 points, exactly the same as his 12-point advantage in 2020.  Trump ran up the score in rural areas (+26 points, up from a 22-point edge in 2020), while Harris ran slightly behind Biden’s 2020 numbers in urban areas (+28 points, compared to Biden +33).  Suburban voters backed Harris by 6 points, less than Biden’s 10-point margin four years ago. Suburban women, a major source of strength for Biden (+19 points), went heavily for Harris (+16 points) – but she lost ground among suburban men (Trump +5 points, compared to +1 for Biden).  While the election was, in part, about the deep divides in American society, Trump’s success in attracting traditional Democratic constituencies was also a defining feature. He improved on his 2020 numbers among Hispanics (41%, +6 points), Black voters (15%, +7 points from 2020), and young voters (46%, +10 points). These rightward shifts were particularly notable among Hispanic men (+8 points), Black men (+12 points from 2020), and men under 30 (+14 points).  Seniors, who backed Trump by 3 points in 2020, were once again in the former president’s column.  Trump won Catholics by 9 points and Protestants by 22 points, while Harris held the edge among Jewish voters (+34 points), Muslims (+32 points), and the religiously unaffiliated (+40 points).  White Catholics favored Trump by 20 points, while White evangelical Christians broke for Trump by a massive 59-point margin.  Voters similarly divided along lines of religious attendance: Trump won those who regularly attend services (of any denomination) by 22 points; Harris won those who infrequently or never attend by 13 points.  The vice president won union households (+12 points, down from Biden’s 14-point edge in 2020). As he did in 2020, Trump had an advantage among military households (+13 points) and gun owner households (+26 points).  Overall, Trump’s strongest support came from White evangelicals, rural voters, Whites without a college degree, conservatives, and men. Harris’ best groups included college-educated women, Black voters, liberals, and urban voters.  That each candidate successfully appealed to their base is hardly surprising in a hyper-partisan political environment. Most Democrats (95%) backed Harris; slightly fewer Republicans (92%) backed Trump.  Nearly three-quarters of Republicans (73%) considered themselves part of the MAGA movement. And while the Harris campaign touted endorsements from prominent Republicans, she was unable to convince enough non-MAGA Republicans to cross the aisle.  Just 7% of voters self-identified as true independents, meaning they do not lean toward one party or another. Harris had a 7-point advantage with this pivotal swing group, a decline from Biden’s 15-point edge in 2020.  Harris was able to appeal to political moderates (+17 points), though once again to a lesser degree than Biden (+26 points in 2020).  Most voters (89%) were locked into their choice of candidate for months, while the small number of late deciders split evenly. In a time of domestic discord and international conflict, Trump was able to project significant strength of character. A majority saw him as a strong leader; fewer felt that way about Harris.  Voters also believed Trump would capably handle a crisis (54-48%) and had the right policy ideas (52%-47%).  Harris had advantages on personal character (53% vs 43% for Trump), honesty (47%-41%), and having the mental capacity to serve as president (57%-52%). Equal numbers thought each would look out for people like them (48%-48%).  But in an election where voters wanted change, slightly more thought Trump would bring positive change (51%-48%).  Trump’s voters were largely motivated by support for the former president (79%) rather than a vote against Harris (21%). Two-thirds of the vice president’s supporters (66%) described their vote as for her; 34% as against Trump.  On balance, voters had slightly more favorable views of Harris (48% favorable, 50% unfavorable) as a person than Trump (47% favorable, 51% unfavorable). The same was true at the vice-presidential level: views of Tim Walz (43% favorable, 42% unfavorable) were marginally better than opinions of JD Vance (43% favorable, 45% unfavorable). Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ended his third-party presidential bid and endorsed Trump in August, was just a touch less popular than the two running mates (42% favorable, 43% unfavorable). Although he won, Trump was unable to fully rehabilitate his image during his time out of office: four years ago, his favorable rating was under water by 7 points (46% favorable vs. 53% unfavorable). The spotlight was less kind to Biden, whose sharply negative favorability rating (40% favorable, 58% unfavorable) slipped significantly from four years ago (50% favorable, 48% unfavorable). Views of the candidates were shaped over the course of a condensed campaign marked by a string of earthshaking events: the criminal cases against Donald Trump, two assassination attempts against the former president, Biden withdrawing from the race after the first debate, and Harris attempting to be the first woman elected to the presidency. Relatively few voters (13%) said the possibility of electing the first woman president was the most important factor to their vote. Harris won these voters by a wide margin – but a third backed Trump to deny Harris the chance to be the first female commander-in-chief. The image of a bloodied and defiant Trump after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, clearly galvanized his supporters, as 16% said the attempts were the most important factor to their vote, and they overwhelmingly backed Trump. Voters had a net-positive view of the Secret Service (52% approve, 46% disapprove), though 62% of Trump voters disapproved of the job the organization is doing. Opinions of the Supreme Court (50% approve, 49% disapprove) were evenly divided, while two-thirds disapproved of Congress (31% approve, 68% disapprove). As voters headed to the polls, they said the economy was far and away the top issue facing the country, followed distantly by immigration and abortion. Four in 10 voters (40%) said inflation was the single most important factor to their vote, and they backed Trump by almost two-to-one. Harris countered Trump’s advantages on inflation and immigration by winning the 26% who focused primarily on abortion by 41 points and the 50% who prioritized the future of American democracy by 27 points. Nearly one-third (31%) said freedom of speech was most important to their vote, and they went somewhat more narrowly for Trump (+8 points). Voters had a negative view of the economy: nearly two-thirds rated it as not good (40%) or downright poor (24%). Four years ago, in the depths of a coronavirus-induced recession, only 14% said economic conditions were poor. In a sign of inflation’s economic toll, nearly three times as many voters said they were falling behind financially as said they were getting ahead. In 2020, 13% said they were getting ahead and 18% were falling behind, with the majority (69%) holding steady. Those who said they were getting ahead went for Harris by 42 points and those holding steady backed her by a narrower 6-point spread, while those falling behind went for Trump by 29 points. Nearly all voters were concerned about being able to afford food (91%, including 67% very concerned), and most were worried about paying for health care (84%, 54% very concerned), housing (79%, 51% very), and gas (79%, 48% very). Voters preferred Trump to Harris by 9 points on handling the economy and by 5 points on taxes. Despite preferring Trump on the economy, voters split on his signature economic policy, increasing tariffs on goods imported to the United States. Trump’s advantage on immigration was larger than his edge on the economy, as voters preferred him on the issue by 15 points. Over the course of the campaign, Trump promised ""the largest domestic deportation operation in American history"" – and succeeded in changing voters’ minds on the issue. Four years ago, 70% believed undocumented immigrants should be offered the chance to apply for legal status, while 29% felt they should be deported. Voters’ views this year were markedly different. Relatedly, two-thirds favored limiting the number of immigrants allowed to apply for asylum – a policy adopted by both the Trump and Biden administrations, but more closely associated with Trump. Voters also thought Trump would do a better job handling crime than Harris by 9 points. Harris’ advantages on climate change (voters preferred her to Trump by 18 points) and abortion (Harris +18 points) outpaced Trump’s edge on immigration and crime. All told, nearly two-thirds (63%) said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from the 59% who felt that way four years ago, before the repeal of Roe v. Wade. The balance was closer, however, when voters considered a ban after 15 weeks: 46% in favor, 53% opposed. A slim majority opposed banning gender-affirming medical treatments for minors who identify as transgender. The Trump campaign spent millions of advertising dollars highlighting Harris’ past support of gender-affirming care for the incarcerated. Even if they did not agree with her on transgender health care, voters saw Harris as better able to handle health care more broadly (by 8 points) and largely envisioned a more active government role. Majorities felt the government should be more involved in lowering the price of prescription medication (75%), eliminating medical debt (58%), and ensuring individuals have health insurance coverage (58%). Slightly fewer, 50%, said the government should be more involved in ensuring children are vaccinated against common preventable diseases, but just 22% wanted the government less involved in vaccinations. A week before the election, Harris used a speech at the Ellipse in Washington – the site of the Jan. 6, 2021, Trump rally that preceded the violent events at the Capitol – to cast Trump as a threat to American democracy. A 55% majority was concerned Trump would move the country closer to authoritarian rule, while less than half (46%) felt Harris posed a similar threat. Even so, majorities felt each candidate’s views were too extreme. Voters split over how much responsibility Trump bore for the violence at the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Harris won those who felt Trump had a great deal of responsibility by 86 points, while Trump won those who felt he was not to blame at all by 91 points. The group in the middle – who felt he was somewhat responsible for the violence – went for Trump by 40 points. In general, slightly more voters felt the way Republicans talk about politics leads to violence (56%) than felt the same about Democrats (50%). Despite unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in the 2020 election results and Trump raising similar concerns about the 2024 contest, three-quarters of voters (75%) were confident votes would be counted accurately at the national level, and even more were confident in their state’s ability to properly count the vote. While 31% lacked confidence that ineligible voters would be prohibited from voting, that was down from 35% who felt that way four years ago. Few (9%) worried that eligible voters would be prevented from casting ballots. Overall, 89% felt both candidates were obligated to accept the results of the election once all the votes were counted and the inevitable legal challenges were resolved. The vast majority of Harris voters (95%) and Trump voters (82%) felt there was an obligation to accept the results. Trump countered Harris’ closing argument by suggesting Harris was too weak and untested to respond effectively in a crisis. Three-quarters thought Harris had been tested, and these voters felt she had delivered negative results by a 5-point margin. Most voters felt Trump had been tested, and slightly more felt he had delivered positive results than negative ones. The ongoing violence in the Middle East served to reinforce Trump’s argument about leadership in a crisis, as voters believed he would do a better job handling the situation. Voters favored continuing aid to Israel to fight Hamas and Hezbollah by 9 points, while favoring continued aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression by 11 points. There was a marked shift in voters’ views of America’s role in the world. Just 20% wanted the country to take a more active role in solving the world’s problems, down from 37% who felt that way four years ago. Roughly equal numbers said the current approach was about right (38%) or preferred a less active role (40%). Trump was able to return the Grand Canyon State to his column after losing it by the narrowest of margins — just 0.4 percentage points — in 2020. As he did four years ago, the former president racked up huge margins with rural voters (+20 points) and White voters without a college degree (+21 points). He also won men by 14 points, his widest margin in any of the seven key swing states and an 8-point increase over his 6-point edge among men in 2020. Improvements with groups that typically vote Democratic also helped tip the state back to Trump. He won 43% of the Hispanic vote, a 3-point improvement over his performance in 2020. He was particularly successful among Hispanic men, battling Harris to a draw. Young voters also moved rightward, backing Harris by just 6 points after going for Biden by 22 points four years ago. Harris kept it close by improving among seniors, a perennially important group thanks to the state’s large number of retirees. Those over age 65 split evenly after backing Trump by 7 points in 2020. Women and college-educated voters formed the backbone of Harris’ support. Her campaign reached across the aisle, touting endorsements from Republican Liz Cheney and John McCain’s grandson. She won moderates by a wide margin, but only won over 8% of Republicans — less than Biden’s 9% in 2020. Trump’s message on immigration clearly resonated in this border state. Nearly half (47%) said immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be deported rather than given a chance to apply for legal status, up from 34% who felt that way in 2020. Another 68% favored reducing the number of immigrants allowed to seek asylum at the border. And voters gave Trump a wide edge over Harris on handling immigration. Democrats had hoped that a state ballot initiative codifying the right to an abortion would boost Harris. While the initiative passed comfortably, Trump was able to win enough voters who believe abortion should be legal to prevail statewide. Trump’s coattails were not quite long enough to carry Kari Lake to a win in the Senate race, however. Some 61% were concerned Lake’s views were too extreme — about the same as the 60% who felt that way when she ran for governor in 2022. Far fewer (50%) felt Democrat Ruben Gallego was too extreme. Voters also had notably more positive evaluations of Gallego (49% favorable) than Lake (41%). Georgia swung back to the Republican column after Biden eked out a win by the slimmest of margins in 2020. With the margins so narrow, the smallest shifts from 2020 would have been enough to flip the state to Trump. Instead, he got substantial movement among constituencies Democrats were counting on to keep the state blue. Harris won women by 5 points, down from Biden’s 10-point advantage in 2020. She won voters under age 30 by 9 points, down from +19 for Biden. There was a similar shift among Black voters, who form the backbone of Democratic support in the Peach State: from Biden +86 points to Harris +71 points. The shift among Black men was particularly consequential, as they went for Harris by just 51 points after breaking for Biden by 76 points four years ago. Harris was counting on a strong performance in the suburbs to offset Trump’s strength (+31 points) with rural voters, but here again she came up well short of Biden’s mark: winning by just 3 points, a far cry from Biden’s 12-point win. Trump was dominant with White voters without a college degree (78%) and White evangelical Christians (82%). Trump appealed to voters across the state on economic grounds and found a ready audience, as huge numbers said they were concerned about paying for necessities like food (93%), health care (87%), gas (84%), and housing (83%). Georgia voters trusted Trump over Harris on the economy by 8 points. Voters preferred Harris by a wider margin (19 points) on abortion. Harris highlighted the case of Amber Thurman, the Georgia mother who died waiting for care after complications from an abortion pill, as an example of the harms of abortion bans. Trump, on the other hand, shone a spotlight on Laken Riley, a nursing student allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant while jogging in February. His message on immigration proved compelling, as voters favored him on the issue by 17 points. Overall, 54% would prefer illegal immigrants be deported, a substantial increase from the 32% who felt that way in 2020. Less than half (44%) said undocumented immigrants should be given the chance to apply for legal status. Georgia was a focal point for controversy after the 2020 election, but 8 in 10 voters were confident this year’s votes would be counted accurately. After narrowly losing the Silver State in both 2016 and 2020, Trump became the first Republican to win Nevada since George W. Bush's slim victory in 2004. Similar to four years ago, the former president won with rural voters (+27 points) and Whites without a college degree (+20 points) – an improvement of 7 points and 6 points from his 2020 margin, respectively. At the same time, Trump’s success this time around was fueled by substantial shifts among younger, less affluent voters. In 2020, voters under age 45 went for Biden by a massive 26-point margin, 61% to 35%. Harris won the group by just 11 points. While there was a gender divide among younger voters in many swing states, in Nevada men under age 45 shifted 18 points toward Trump and women shifted 15 points in his direction. Voters in households earning less than $50,000 per year split between the two candidates after backing Biden by 17 points four years ago. Trump also gained ground among union households, who broke for Harris by 8 points compared to Biden’s 15-point edge in 2020. Nevada’s tourism-driven economy was hit hard by inflation and has been particularly slow to recover from the pandemic, and voters’ economic stress showed. More than one-third (35%) said they were falling behind financially, up 16 points from 2020. Huge numbers were concerned about being able to afford necessities like food (92%), health care (85%), gas (82%), and housing (80%). And 43% said inflation was the single most important issue to their vote, the second-highest number among the swing states. Trump won those who prioritized inflation by nearly two-to-one. Unlike in some of the other key states, Hispanic voters did not shift toward Trump in Nevada. They went for Harris by 14 points after backing Biden by 12 points. As it was for much of the country, immigration was a key issue in Nevada: 31% said it was the single most important factor to their vote, and these voters went for Trump by 69 points. Overall, 41% said immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be deported, up from 31% who felt that way in 2020. Nevada’s ballot initiative legalizing the right to an abortion passed easily, but it did not help Democrats as much as they might have hoped. A significant segment of those who believed abortion should be legal backed Trump, as did nearly all (83%) of those who felt it should be illegal. Even though Trump won Nevada, it wasn’t enough to propel Republican Sam Brown to a win over incumbent Senator Jacky Rosen. While Brown won the 43% of voters who said that which party controlled the upper chamber was the most important factor to their vote by 4 points, voters had slightly more favorable views of Rosen (46% favorable) than Brown (44%)—just enough to make the difference in a tight race. Trump triumphed once again in North Carolina, as Republicans have now won 10 of the last 11 presidential elections in the state. Barack Obama’s narrow win in 2008 was the only Democratic victory since Jimmy Carter’s presidency. Trump posted similar results to 2020 among White voters without a college degree (74%, vs 69% four years ago), rural voters (63%, up 3 points from 2020), and White evangelical Christians (87%, up 1 point from 2020). That alone might have been a winning formula – but shifts among Black voters and voters under age 30 pushed Trump over the top. Overall, young voters backed Harris by just 8 points after going for Biden by 16 points four years ago. The shift was entirely powered by young men, who backed the former president by 16 points. Women under 30 went for Harris by 25 points. The story was similar among Black voters: Black women were nearly universal in their support for Harris (93%), while 19% of Black men backed Trump, up from 6% in 2020. Overall, 88% of Black voters picked Harris, down substantially from Biden’s 94%. Harris won political moderates, a group that voted for Biden by 26 points, by just 16 points. She had hoped to run up the margins in the suburbs, but Trump more than held his own with 44% of the vote, up from 43% in 2020. Just 12% of North Carolina voters said they were getting ahead financially, while almost three times as many (31%) said they were falling behind – and these voters broke heavily for Trump. Some 42% cited the economy as the top issue facing the country. Harris kept the race close by nearly battling Trump to a draw on who could better handle the economy. Overall, voters trusted him over her by 5 points. Still, the 41% of voters who said inflation was the most important factor to their vote broke for Trump by 31 points, 65%-34%. In the governor’s race, Republican Mark Robinson faced allegations of discriminatory remarks and inappropriate online behavior. The scandals did not help Republicans retake the governorship, which Democrats have now won in 8 of the last 9 elections. A majority (56%) held unfavorable opinions of Robinson, while more than half (52%) viewed Democrat Josh Stein favorably. Trump endorsed Robinson, but a majority of voters said the endorsement did not affect their view of the former president. In 2020, Biden declared victory after Pennsylvania was finally called for him nearly four days after the election. This time it is back in Trump’s column, though only barely – a continuation of the state’s see-saw between the parties after Trump’s less-than-one-point victory in 2016, and Biden’s similarly narrow margin four years later. Trump pulled it off a bit more comfortably, with big wins among some of his mainstay groups: rural voters (63%), White voters without a college degree (62%) and men (55%). Those margins, combined with improvements among some traditionally Democratic groups, were enough to flip the state red once again. As he did elsewhere across the country, Trump made notable gains among young voters and Black voters in Pennsylvania, driven almost entirely by improvements among men. He won 23% of Black men, a 17-point bump for him from 2020. He won men under age 30 outright after losing them by 13 points four years ago. He also won 47% of the suburban vote, compared to 44% in 2020. His improvement in the suburbs was fueled by suburban men, a group he won outright after getting 47% of their vote in 2020. Harris ran strong among women, college-educated voters and suburban women. She campaigned in the state with Republican Liz Cheney in an attempt to reach anti-Trump and moderate Republicans, but managed to pull in only 7% of Republican voters overall – less than the 9% Biden received in 2020. She got 59% among moderates – enough to keep the election close but not enough to put her over the finish line. The economy ranked as the top concern for Pennsylvania voters, and more trusted Trump on the issue than Harris by 8 points. Just over 4 in 10 said inflation was the most important factor to their vote – those voters went for Trump by 37 points. And, only 11% said they were getting ahead financially, compared to the 32% who said they were falling behind. Twice as many of those voters went for Trump as chose Harris. Trump’s support for fracking, an important industry in the state (and an issue on which Harris shifted positions), also had an impact: 63% of Pennsylvania voters wanted to see more of it in the state, and they broke for Trump by 37 points. Immigration is another issue where Trump’s message appeared to sway voters. Nearly half (45%) said they would prefer to see illegal immigrants deported rather than given a chance for legal status, up from 31% who felt that way in 2020. Some 27% said immigration was key to their vote, and voters gave Trump a double-digit advantage on the issue. A majority of voters (53%) held a favorable view of Gov. Josh Shapiro, more than viewed Harris (47%) or Trump (48% favorably). Whether Shapiro, who was under consideration for Harris’ vice president, could have helped her carry the state if he would have been on the ticket is one of the major unanswered questions of this election. In 2016, Trump was the first Republican to win Wisconsin’s presidential vote since Ronald Reagan in 1984, and he did so by the narrowest of margins (less than 1 percentage point). He lost by a similarly miniscule margin in 2020 but managed flip the script this time around. Across the country, Trump’s winning formula involved holding on to his base and making significant inroads with young men, Black men and Hispanics. Wisconsin was somewhat different: It was a remarkably close race driven by small shifts in support rather than big swings among traditional Democratic constituencies. Trump did well among his base of conservatives (89%, +1 point from 2020), White evangelicals (75%, -3 points), rural voters (58%, +1 point) and those without a college degree (55%, +2). He got 48% among men under age 30, up just a touch from his 45% mark four years ago. He lost ground among non-White men (37%, compared to 42% in 2020). But, the smallest improvements loom large when the statewide margins are so slim – and even more so when those improvements are among very large groups. Trump gained 2 points among men and 1 point among Whites, and that made all the difference. He was also able to keep it close in the suburbs, which Harris needed to offset his strength in rural areas. Biden won the suburbs by 4 points in 2020; the margin was 5 points this year. Trump also managed to increase his vote share among moderates (41%, compared to 34% in 2020) by just enough. Issues on the minds of suburban voters also played to Trump’s advantage. Immigration was the second-most important issue to Wisconsin voters, and he carried those who said immigration was the most important factor to their vote by 71 points. He was also seen as better equipped to handle the issue: 55%, compared to 34% for Harris. Trump also won the law-and-order vote: 37% said they were very concerned about crime in their own communities, voters thought Trump was better on crime than Harris by 14 points, and those highly concerned about crime went for the former president by 30 points. Transgender issues, including gender surgeries for inmates and transgender people participating in women’s sports, also became an issue during the campaign. Over half of Wisconsin voters (55%) said they thought support for transgender rights has gone too far. Abortion rights were a major emphasis of Harris’ campaign, and she led Trump by a wide margin among voters who said it was their number-one issue (+48 points) and those who believed abortion should be legal (46%). Harris was also seen as better able to handle abortion policy by 23 points. Overall, Harris did well with women (53%), particularly with college-educated women (65%). In the end, it came down to the economy: it was the top issue for voters overall (40%), 31% said they were falling behind financially, and 64% felt the national economy was in bad shape. Nearly 4 in 10 said inflation was the most important factor to their vote, and they went for Trump by 39 points. In the Senate race, the Badger State’s tendency toward ticket-splitting helped pull incumbent Democrat Tammy Baldwin over the finish line. In her 2018 race, about 10 percent of voters who backed the Republican candidate for governor also voted for Baldwin. The effect was much more muted this time around – only 4% of Trump voters backed her for the Senate – but it was just enough to tip a tight race her way. Michigan is back in Trump’s column after Biden carried the state by less than three percentage points in 2020. Trump did so by garnering large margins among men (55%), rural voters (59%) and White voters without a college degree (61% points). But, like he did in many of the swing states, he also managed to make inroads among some traditionally Democratic groups, which helped swing the state back his way. He won 11% of Black voters, up from 6% in 2020. He was particularly successful in appealing to Black men. Voters under age 30 split evenly, as Trump improved on his 2020 performance among young men (+13 points) and young women (+14 points). He also managed to boost his share of the suburban vote. He didn’t carry the suburbs – Harris did by 4 points – but he did better among",,,

"National polls show Trump, Harris in tight race as electorate is unhappy with choices","Two new national polls released Sunday show former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are engaged in an extremely close race for the White House, even if a majority of voters are dissatisfied with having to choose between either of the candidates. An ABC News/Ipsos poll of 2,267 likely voters has Harris leading Trump 49%-46%, with a 2% margin of error. Seventy-four percent of those voters say they feel the country is heading on the ""wrong track,"" including 50% of those who are backing Harris, the results show. Among Trump supporters, that figure rises to 98%.The poll, which was taken from Oct. 29-Nov. 1, also revealed that 60% of voters are dissatisfied with the candidates presented to them in this race for the presidency. Meanwhile, 42% of likely voters say their personal financial situation has worsened under the Biden-Harris administration, according to the poll. In another national survey, Trump and Harris are tied at 49%. The NBC News poll of 1,000 registered voters, which was conducted from Oct. 30 to Nov. 2, has a margin of error of 3.1%. Of those who responded, Harris leads Trump among Black voters by 87%-9%, voters under 30 years old by 57%-41% and White voters with college degrees 55%-43%, according to NBC News.

"Fox News projects Trump beats Harris in Wisconsin, flipping 'blue wall' state back to red","The Fox News Decision Desk projects former President Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin in the 2024 election against Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump officially beat Harris in the once ""blue wall"" state, which was considered a toss-up by political handicappers across the board. As a result, Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes will be allocated to Trump in his bid for the White House. The Midwestern state has been thought to be crucial to Democrat wins for executive office. Notably, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's failure to campaign in the state was credited by many for her loss to Trump in 2016.   President Biden's 2020 defeat of Trump included flipping Wisconsin and a number of other states for Democrats.  Both Trump and Harris made Wisconsin a focal point of their presidential campaigns, visiting the state frequently through the last weeks of the election.   The two candidates each emphasized their support for workers in the state, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., even lent his help to Harris' effort to court working-class voters. Trump deployed his own star power in the state, featuring former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre at a Wisconsin rally roughly a week before the election.   Fox News Power Rankings held that the state was a ""Toss Up"" going into the contest.   One of the factors that defined the race in Wisconsin was the significant gap between men and women in polls, with men more often supporting Trump and women more often supporting Harris.",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-projects-trump-beats-harris-wisconsin-flipping-blue-wall-state-back-red
"Trump claims victory, Harris skips party: The biggest surprises of election night","The 2024 presidential election cycle came to a close in the early morning hours on Wednesday, capping off a wild campaign cycle with President-elect Trump projected to win the presidency and go back to the White House on Jan. 20.     Following speculation that the election results could drag out days, Fox News Decision Desk is projecting a Trump victory after notching key wins in a handful of battleground states.     Fox News Digital compiled the biggest election surprises on Tuesday evening into Wednesday, including Harris calling it a night without addressing supporters, and Florida Republicans celebrating the failure of an abortion amendment. Trump became the projected winner of the 2024 election cycle early Wednesday morning, after securing key battleground states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.     He vowed to lead the ""golden age of America"" in his victory speech in Florida.     ""Every citizen, I will fight for you, for your family and your future. Every single day, I will be fighting for you. And with every breath in my body, I will not rest until we have delivered the strong, safe and prosperous America that our children deserve and that you deserve. This will truly be the golden age of America. That's what we have to have. This is a magnificent victory for the American people that will allow us to make America great again,"" Trump said.     The president-elect called his campaign the ""greatest political movement of all time"" while vowing to ""fix everything about our country.""     ""There's never been anything like this in this country, and maybe beyond. And now it's going to reach a new level of importance because we're going to help our country heal,"" he said.     ""We're going to help our country here. We have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly. We're going to fix our borders. We're going to fix everything about our country and we've made history for a reason tonight. And the reason is going to be just that. We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,"" he added to cheers from the crowd.    Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign called it an early night on Tuesday. The Harris-Walz campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon encouraged supporters to go home and ""get some sleep"" ahead of 11 p.m. on Tuesday, which was followed by Harris skipping an address to her supporters. ""Those of you who were around in 2020 know this well: It takes time for all the votes to be counted – and all the votes will be counted,"" O'Malley Dillon wrote in a dismal note to Democrats Tuesday evening. ""That’s how our system works. What we do know is this race is not going to come into focus until the early morning hours. We’ll continue to keep you all updated as we get more information. This is what we’ve been built for, so let’s finish up what we have in front of us tonight, get some sleep, and get ready to close out strong tomorrow.""    Harris held the watch party at her alma mater, Howard University, where supporters flocked to the campus before results began ticking towards a Trump victory. The campaign soon reported that Harris would not speak to supporters or the nation the night of the election, and would instead deliver remarks on Wednesday. The campaign’s co-chair, Cedric Richmond, instead delivered brief remarks.     ""We still have votes to count, we still have states that have not been called yet We will continue overnight to fight to make sure that every vote is counted, that every voice has spoken. So you won't hear from the vice president tonight. But you will hear from her tomorrow,"" Richmond said, ahead of Trump's eventual victory.    President Biden notably did not join the Harris watch party at Howard University on Tuesday, instead staying at the White House and congratulating down-ballot Democrats who came out of their races victorious. Biden kicked off the 2024 campaign cycle running for re-election, but dropped out of the race in July as concerns mounted over his mental acuity and age.     Republicans are on track to take control of the Senate, with Ohio Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno declaring Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is ""fired.""     ""Chuck Schumer: Thanks for the help in the primary, but you’re fired, buddy,"" Moreno told supporters in his victory speech. ""With Donald Trump and J.D. Vance in the White House, we’re gonna have a new agenda. We’re gonna be pro-immigration not pro-invasion. We’re gonna be an energy-dominant nation."" Fox News projects the GOP will take control of the Senate, as ?the party will hold at least 51 seats, enough for an outright majority. Nebraska was the state to officially tip the scales – following Moreno flipping longtime Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown’s seat in Ohio – where Republican incumbent Sen. Deb Fischer is projected to defeat independent challenger Dan Osborn.    Trump is projected to win a bevy of battleground states, including Georgia, North Carolina and the arguably top battleground of the 2024 cycle, Pennsylvania.     Speculation mounted in the weeks leading up to Election Day that the vote count could drag out for days in a handful of states, including Pennsylvania, where 2020's vote took four days to tally. Despite delayed polling hours in some Pennsylvania and Georgia jurisdictions, the states managed to tally votes overnight Tuesday, handing Trump victories in key battlegrounds.    Both the Trump and Harris campaigns placed heightened emphasis on campaigning in the Keystone State, as well as in Georgia and Wisconsin, repeatedly holding rallies and campaign events to build support. Despite polls showing Trump and Harris were neck and neck in polls ahead of the election, Trump ended the cycle victorious in the battlegrounds, which launched him to victory.     On the state level, voters in Florida voters rejected an amendment that would have created a constitutional right to abortion, while voters in California approved of a ballot measure that cracks down on crime.     In Florida, voters rejected Amendment 4, which stated, ""No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.""    DeSantis signed the Heartbeat Protection Act into law last year, which banned most abortions after six weeks of gestation. Amendment 4 would have overturned the pro-life law.     In Florida, constitutional amendments must get 60% of the vote, not a simple majority, to pass. Amendment 4 received majority support among voters but failed to meet the 60% threshold.     After its failure to pass, pro-life and religious groups celebrated the news as a massive win for the pro-life movement.     ""The defeat of Amendment 4 in Florida is a huge victory for the whole state, especially its most vulnerable. Proponents of Amendment 4 used the same playbook they have in other states which relied on fearmongering and disinformation backed by a funding advantage of tens of millions of out-of-state dollars,"" Brian Burch, president of CatholicVote, said in a statement.     In California, voters approved of Proposition 36, which will crack down on theft and drug trafficking in a state that has been battered by crime for years.     Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom opposed the ballot initiative, saying ahead of the vote: ""Prop 36 takes us back to the 1980s, mass incarceration — it promotes a promise that can’t be delivered.""    A decade ago, voters in the state approved California's Proposition 47, which reduced shoplifting charges regarding the theft of $950 or less from felonies to misdemeanors. Voters' approval of Prop 36 on Tuesday reverses Prop. 47.     Crime has spiraled in California in recent years, most notably in 2021 and 2022, when smash-and-grab crimes hit a fever pitch in the state. Criminals were repeatedly caught on camera storming high-end department stores with crowbars and other weapons in order to smash display cases before stealing merchandise and fleeing. Police groups and others in the state pinned blame for the crime trends on Proposition 47.

Trump wins Arizona to sweep swing states and secure 312 total electoral votes,"President-elect Trump has officially won Arizona, avenging his 2020 election loss in the crucial swing state. The race in Arizona was called by the Associated Press on Saturday evening. With Arizona, Trump has secured 11 more electoral votes, and has won 312 electoral votes in total. His opponent, Vice President Harris, only garnered 226 electoral votes. Trump's Arizona pick-up ends the battle for swing states in the 2024 presidential election. In addition to Arizona, he picked up electoral votes in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania. President Biden won the state of Arizona by less than one-half of 1% in the 2020 election and the results in the key area of Maricopa County were also slim, with Biden beating Trump by 2%. Before Biden won Arizona in 2020, Republicans had carried the state every year since 1996. Immigration was arguably the most highly important issue in Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico. ""We have to have swifter incarceration at the border,"" Mary from Phoenix told Fox News Digital last month. ""And if there's a suspicion that they're going to commit a crime, lock them up."" Others in Arizona agreed with Harris' message in her numerous trips to the state that Trump represents a threat to ""Democracy."" ""Kamala, Kamala, Kamala!"" a Tempe man named Bob told Fox News Digital. ""The rich have been riding a wave of tax cuts and not responsibility, and the Supreme Court's been taking away the rights of the government agencies that regulate things. So we need to get that back in line and Kamala is going to do that instead of putting more Federalist judges up there."" Arizona is also home to a higher proportion of Hispanic voters than the rest of the country, and while they favored Biden by 19 points in the last election, they had shown signs of shifting toward Trump leading up to the election. The Grand Canyon State is also voting for a new senator after independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema decided not to run for re-election this year. The Republican candidate is Kari Lake, a former TV news host who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2022. The Democrats have fielded Rep. Ruben Gallego, a former Marine who represents Arizona’s 3rd Congressional District.

Fox News projects Trump victory over Harris in Pennsylvania,"Fox News Decision Desk projects former President Donald Trump has won the critical swing state of Pennsylvania over Vice President Kamala Harris.       Polls showed a close race throughout the campaign for Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes.      Pennsylvania was once characterized by then-Bill Clinton campaign strategist James Carville as ""Philadelphia and Pittsburgh with Alabama in between.""      The two cities again were strongholds for Harris and Democrats down the ticket, while Republicans are projected to fare well in the midstate, particularly in Reps. Glenn Thompson’s, R-Pa., and John Joyce’s, R-Pa., districts.      Both candidates also visited the Commonwealth multiple times.      Trump notably held a rally in Allentown, the third-largest city, in a key congressional district analyzed as ""EVEN"" by the Cook Political Report.      Harris, meanwhile, appeared to focus her campaigning in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area – where President Biden hails from – as well as Pittsburgh.      Biden also visited the Scranton area during the campaign, and spoke to union labor in Northeast Philadelphia, the reddest part of the deep-blue city.      Trump notably broke the proverbial blue wall in 2016 by winning Pennsylvania, while Biden won it back for the Democrats in 2020.      During the campaign, Republican activist Scott Presler was a ubiquitous sight around the state, registering voters at flea markets, community fairs and Penn State football games.      A ""Team Trump"" bus tour featuring surrogates from Pennsylvania and across the nation wound its way through the Keystone State, notably making stops in Duncansville, Chambersburg and Newport.      The traditionally ‘purple’ Rust Belt commonwealth has returned to ""political battleground"" conversations in recent years, after Trump upset Hillary Clinton there in 2016.      While the governor’s office has flipped every few terms and the legislature is typically Republican majority – though not entirely as of late – Democrats fare much better than the GOP on the presidential level.      Trump narrowly defeated Clinton by close to the same margin Biden defeated the then-incumbent in 2020.      Democrats have made gains on the House and Senate level there in the time since, with Pat Toomey’s formerly red seat going to then-Lt. Gov. John Fetterman in 2022.      Democrats also flipped a key swing district upon the 2018 retirement of anti-Trump Republican Charles W. Dent in Allentown, and Rep. Scott Perry’s, R-Pa., Cumberland Valley seat is primed for a close contest.      One top state official who was optimistic about Trump’s chances was State Sen. Cris Dush, R-Brookville, whose district covers more than 10% of the state in its forested northwestern expanse.      Dush’s district covers all-or-parts-of Jefferson, Elk, Cameron, Centre, Clinton, McKean and Potter counties. Centre – home to Penn State University – was a rare blue county in the midstate targeted by Republicans like activist Scott Presler during his statewide GOP voter registration push.      Dush noted neighboring Clinton County, home to Lock Haven, was solidly Democratic until the Trump era. ""They just went over 3-to-1 Republican.""      ""This is a massive shift that's coming in rural Pennsylvania… and part of it is that my working class, middle-age and senior constituents are seeing what's happening to their jobs and with inflation and this craziness,"" he said.      ""With a man now being able to be called a woman: that kind of stuff too. They’ve just finally had enough.""      Pennsylvania was one of seven swing states that were viewed as the most vital to winning the election, with the others being Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan and Wisconsin.       There are also several key congressional races this cycle in Pennsylvania, as Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., tries to fend off a challenge from GOP State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Macungie, Rep. Matthew Cartwright faces off with businessman Rob Bresnahan Jr., and Rep. Chris Deluzio is in a key match-up with State Rep. Rob Mercuri, R-Pine.      Combined, the seven states award 93 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.

Trump expected to name Sen. Marco Rubio as Secretary of State,"President-elect Trump is expected to nominate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as Secretary of State, a source familiar tells Fox News.      The source noted that while Trump could still change his mind at the last minute, as of now he’s planning on offering the job to Rubio, the three-term senator whom the former president considered as his running mate this summer before naming Sen. JD Vance as the GOP vice presidential nominee.      Spokespeople for the Trump transition didn’t immediately comment.      The news was first reported by the New York Times earlier this evening.       Rubio, the son of Cuban exiles, was first elected to the Senate in 2010 as part of the Tea Party wave. He is known on Capitol Hill as a foreign policy hawk who favors maintaining U.S. alliances overseas, including NATO.       But Rubio, who sits on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, has taken similar positions to Trump on international conflicts, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Israel's war with Hamas.      In April, the 53-year-old senator voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia.      Rubio was a rival to Trump during the combustible 2016 Republican presidential nomination battle [with Trump deriding him as ‘Little Marco’] but over the years has become a strong Trump ally in the Senate.      Rubio, the son of Cuban exiles, would become the first Latino Secretary of State in the nation’s history.      The Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), a major backer of Trump this year, applauded the news.       RJC National Chairman Senator Norm Coleman and CEO Matt Brooks said in a statement that ""we know that with Senator Rubio leading the State Department, America will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and confront our enemies.""      ""In these extraordinarily dangerous times, Senator Rubio is an outspoken defender of Israel who has always had the Jewish state’s back,"" they added.      Less than a week after winning a second term in the White House, Trump has already begun to shape his cabinet.      In the past 24 hours, Trump has selected Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations, Tom Homan as the new ""border czar,"" Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida to be his national security advisor, and former Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York to steer the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).   ",11-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-expected-name-sen-marco-rubio-secretary-state-report
Trump taps former New York Rep Lee Zeldin to lead EPA,"Former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin has been picked to join President-elect Donald Trump’s administration as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator.      Trump confirmed the news in a statement Monday afternoon, writing in part, ""Lee, with a very strong legal background, has been a true fighter for America First policies. He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet. He will set new standards on environmental review and maintenance, that will allow the United States to grow in a healthy and well-structured way.""      Trump said Zeldin has ""brilliantly"" handled some ""extremely difficult and complex situations."" He said he is sure Zeldin will ""quickly prove to be a great contributor!""      The New York Post was first to report on Trump picking Zeldin to lead the EPA.      ""I'm looking forward to serving in President Trump's Cabinet as EPA Administrator. Together, we will restore American energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, make the United States the global leader of Artificial Intelligence advancement, and slash the red tape holding back American workers from upward economic mobility,"" Zeldin told Fox News Digital on Monday. ""We will do this all while conserving our environment, protecting access to clean air and water, and keeping the American people healthy. I look forward to contributing to President Trump’s agenda to build a more prosperous future for our nation.""       Zeldin represented New York’s 1st Congressional District from 2015 to 2023, and in 2022 he made a run for governor, garnering the most votes for a Republican candidate in 50 years.      Zeldin grew up in Suffolk County, which is the same county he represented as a federal lawmaker.      At age 23, he became the youngest attorney in New York State at that time.      Zeldin served in the Army for four years, holding roles like military intelligence officer, prosecutor and military magistrate.      In 2006, he deployed to Iraq with the 82nd Airborne Division as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, he continues to serve as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, according to the statement put out by Trump.      Zeldin was elected to the New York state Senate in 2010, where he served until 2014, when he was elected to Congress.      During his eight years working at the U.S. Capitol, Zeldin served on the House Foreign Affairs and House Financial Services committees.

"Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump's Department of Government Efficiency","President-elect Trump announced that billionaire Elon Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency.      Trump said that the pair will work together to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.""      ""It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,"" the announcement on Tuesday evening said. ""Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ‘DOGE’ for a very long time.""      The president-elect said that Musk and Ramaswamy will provide ""advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.""      Trump said that the agency will be focused on creating a more efficient U.S. government that looks to make ""life better for all Americans.""      ""Importantly, we will drive out the massive waste and fraud which exists throughout our annual $6.5 Trillion Dollars of Government Spending. They will work together to liberate our Economy, and make the U.S. Government accountable to 'WE THE PEOPLE.'"" Trump said.       ""Their work will conclude no later than July 4, 2026 - A smaller Government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy, will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th Anniversary of The Declaration of Independence. I am confident they will succeed!""      In a X post, Ramaswamy reacted to his appointment.      ""We will not go gently, Elon Musk,"" he wrote in the post.      Ramaswamy has been a vocal supporter of Trump after he suspended his presidential campaign in Jan. 24.      In a statement on X, the founder Roivant Sciences, a pharmaceutical company, said that he would be dropping out of the Ohio Senate appointment.      ""And yes, this means I’m withdrawing myself from consideration for the pending Senate appointment in Ohio,"" he wrote. ""Whoever Governor DeWine appoints to JD’s seat has some big shoes to fill. I will help them however I can.""      Similarly, Musk has been a key component to Trump's campaign – with the tech entrepreneur crisscrossing key battleground states leading up to the 2024 election.      In response to his position in Trump's White House, Musk wrote: ""Threat to democracy? Nope, threat to BUREAUCRACY!!!""

Here are the most talked-about candidates for top posts in Trump's administration,"After winning the 2024 presidential election, President-elect Trump's next big move is to fill his Cabinet with the right leaders that will reinforce his agenda over the next four years.      There are several candidates rumored for each post, but the following individuals are the most talked-about contenders for the top positions:      Secretary of State   Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who was a leading contender on Trump's short list for vice president, has been floated for secretary of state.      Rubio currently serves as vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence and is a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Relations – leading on various initiatives that seek to bolster national security.      The Florida senator didn't rule out taking a position in the administration during a post-election interview.      ""I always am interested in serving this country,"" Rubio told CNN. ""I haven't had any set conversations with anybody in the Trump administration. Either way, I plan to work with them, whether it's in the Senate, which is an important place to be, or in some other capacity.""      Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., is also being considered for the Cabinet. Hagerty served as ambassador to Japan under Trump and has pushed back on the foreign policies of the Biden-Harris administration.      Former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien is also in contention for the role, Fox News Digital was told. Since leaving the Trump administration, he cofounded the international policy advisory firm American Global Strategies.      Fox News Digital was told that Richard Grenell is also eyeing the position. Grenell is the former ambassador to Germany and former acting director of national intelligence under Trump. He's also a potential pick for national security adviser.      Secretary of Defense   Combat-decorated Green Beret Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., could be tapped to lead America's defense agency.       Waltz, who was CEO of defense contractor Metis Solutions and Pentagon defense policy director under Defense Secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates, serves on the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence Committees.      Walz serves as the chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and as a member of the Oversight and Accountability Committee and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.      Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo could return to run the defense agency after serving during Trump's first term.      Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., was being floated for the role but took his name out of consideration for a Cabinet position, a source close to the Republican senator told Fox News.       Department of Homeland Security   Chad Wolf served as the acting secretary of Homeland Security under Trump during his first term.       Wolf currently works as America First Policy Institute's (AFPI) executive director, chief strategy officer, and chair of the Center for Homeland Security & Immigration.      Tom Homan, former acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump, is also a contender. Homan is a former police officer and visiting fellow at the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation.      Attorney General   Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, an attorney who previously specialized in Supreme Court litigation, served as law clerk to Judge Dee Benson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, and then with future Supreme Court Justice Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.       Lee has supported Trump throughout his 2024 campaign, slamming the ""Democratic Party establishment"" for the criminal cases against the president-elect in an interview with Fox.      While on the campaign trail, Trump said he would consider Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton for the AG position. Paxton has been a staunch supporter of Trump throughout his challenges to the 2020 election and legal battles.      The day before the election, Paxton filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit supporting claims that special prosecutor Jack Smith was illegally appointed by the DOJ.      Matt Whitiker served as the acting attorney general for a year during Trump's first term. Prior to taking on the role, Whitiker served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa and then as chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.      Department of Energy   North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who was a leading contender to be Trump's vice president, is reportedly being considered to head the Department of Energy.       Burgum leads one of the top energy producing states in the country and has championed ""innovation over regulation"" on energy policy, saying that the U.S. needs to bolster oil production and not rely on foreign oil. In his speech at the Republican National Convention, Burgum focused heavily on American energy dominance.      Former Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette could return to his post in the energy department he led for two years during Trump's first term. Brouillette recently stepped down as president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute.      Department of Interior   Trump could reassign his former Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to lead the agency for another four years.       Also rumored for the position is Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who has fought the Biden administration on energy over the years.      Department of Education   Trump has said that he is going to close the Department of Education when he takes office.       Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos could come back to serve another four years in the role under Trump's second term.      While on the campaign trail, Trump suggested former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy or former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin could be chosen to lead the administration on education.      Department of the Treasury   Billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent has worked as a top economic adviser to Trump. ""I’m going to do whatever President Trump asks,"" he told CNBC when asked about a potential Cabinet position.      John Paulson, also a billionaire hedge fund manager, recently told the Wall Street Journal that if appointed, he would work with Elon Musk to cut spending and extend the former president's 2017 tax cuts.      Other contenders include Jay Clayton, who chaired the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under Trump, and Robert Lighthizer, who was Trump's U.S. rrade representative. Lighthizer serves as the chair of the Center for American Trade at AFPI.       Chief of Staff   Susie Wiles, a longtime political strategist who worked closely with Trump as a senior adviser to his 2024 campaign, has been floated as a contender for chief of staff.       During his victory speech, Trump thanked Wiles for her role in the campaign. Wiles has been a player in Republican politics for several decades, working on former President Ronald Reagan's campaign in 1980.      Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was previously floated as a possible contender for the role but recently told ""The Guy Benson Show"" that he would not take the position if it was offered. However, McCarthy did suggest that Wiles would be great for the role.      Ambassador to United Nations   House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., one of the first lawmakers in Congress to endorse Trump for re-election, is angling for the role of ambassador to the United Nations, Fox News Digital is told.      That job was previously held by Nikki Haley, who challenged Trump in the 2024 Republican primary.      Press Secretary   Karoline Leavitt worked as the national press secretary for Trump's 2024 campaign. Leavitt served as Trump's White House assistant press secretary before running to represent New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District in the 2022 midterms.       Also expected to have significant roles in the administration are Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.       RFK will likely work in redesigning America's health agencies, recently telling MSNBC he would get rid of ""entire departments"" within the FDA.

Voter registration fraud probe involving 2500 applications confirmed by Pa. election officials,"A county in the pivotal battleground of Pennsylvania is investigating roughly 2,500 voter registration forms that were flagged for potential fraud, Pennsylvania’s Department of State confirmed to Fox News Digital on Friday.      The office confirmed it has been in contact with Lancaster County since last week, after it reported receiving two separate batches of apparently fraudulent voter registration forms.       ""Suspected fraudulent voter registration forms were dropped off at the Board of Elections Office in two batches at or near the deadline for submission,"" the board said in a statement Friday.       Both the local District Attorney’s office and the Lancaster County Board of Elections are working to review and vet the applications.      In a statement Friday, county election officials said the concerns were first noted ""during the staff's normal process to review and enter applications into [a Pennsylvania database] and law enforcement was alerted.      The forms marked as suspicious either had false names, duplicative handwriting, or unverifiable or incorrect identifying information, they added-- prompting county election officials to immediately notify both the Pennsylvania Department of State and the state attorney general’s office and open a criminal investigation.       Speaking at a press conference Friday, Lancaster County officials urged calm and stressed that the election system did what it was intended to do in preventing fraud. The applications were not limited to a single party, and were collected in various spots across the county.      ""The fact of the matter is, we’ve contained this,"" Lancaster County Commissioner Ray D’Agostino, a Republican who chairs the county election board,, told reporters.  ""This is not right. It’s illegal. It’s immoral. And we found it, and we’re going to take care of it.""      Ultimately, he said, ""the people of Lancaster County can be confident in how we conduct our elections.""       The Pennsylvania Department of State applauded Lancaster County Friday ""for their diligent work in spotting this potential fraud and bringing it to the attention of law enforcement.""

During his victory celebration in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump gave a special thanks to Wiles for her prominent role in the campaign.       ""Let me also express my tremendous appreciation for Susie [Wiles] and Chris [LaCivita], on the job you did. Susie, come, Susie,"" he said. ""Susie likes to stay sort of in the back, let me tell you.

Trump described Wiles as ""tough, smart, innovative"" and said she is ""universally admired and respected.""       He noted her place as the first female chief of staff in U.S. history, saying: ""I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.""      Veteran GOP strategist John Brabender told Fox News Digital: ""If they searched high and low in the entire world, there is not a better choice than Susie Wiles for White House Chief of Staff.""      When it comes to Wiles, Brabender said, ""nobody’s going to have a better relationship with the president, who understands that she is there to help him however she can, and he will respect that.""      ""Susie will have no other agenda than helping the president help people,"" Brabender emphasized. And he noted that ""everybody who works for Susie in the White House will be vetted by Susie which means that there’re going to be nothing but the best.""       A longtime Florida-based Republican strategist who ran Trump's campaign in the state in 2016 and 2020, Wiles’ decades-long political career stretches back to working as former President Reagan’s campaign scheduler for his 1980 presidential bid.       Wiles also ran Rick Scott's 2010 campaign for Florida governor and briefly served as the manager of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman's 2012 presidential campaign.       Wiles currently serves as a senior adviser to Trump and is campaign co-chair alongside Chris LaCivita.      Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was previously floated as a possible contender for chief of staff, but recently told ""The Guy Benson Show"" that he would not take the position if it was offered.

House of Representatives: Race to majority tightens with Republicans inching closer,"The race for the majority in the House of Representatives is on with each party vying for power and key races yet to be called.      As of Saturday, Republicans held 212 seats and Democrats held 200. A party needs 218 seats for a majority.      The path to victory for a Democratic majority in the House is narrowing, with the party needing to sweep the most contested races to win power.       Many undeclared seats are in the western U.S. or in swing districts, including Arizona, Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio, Maryland, New York, Maine and Alaska.      Key House of Representative Races:   Alaska’s at-large congressional district:   Democratic incumbent Rep. Mary Sattler Peltola is in a tight race in Alaska’s at-large congressional district, where she is trailing Republican entrepreneur Nick Begich.      As of Saturday evening, Begich was leading Peltola 49.49% to 45.42% with 76.5% of the vote counted.      Arizona’s 6th Congressional District:   The race in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District is tight, with the Republican candidate barely leading.       Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani, a first-term lawmaker, was leading former Democratic state lawmaker Kirsten Engel by just 1,795 votes as of Saturday evening. According to Fox News' Decision Desk, 75.64% of the vote has been counted.      California’s 13th Congressional District:   Republican Rep. John Duarte is leading former Democratic state Assembly member Adam Gray in California’s 13th Congressional District, but the highly contested race remains uncalled as of Saturday.      With 61.7% of the vote, Duarte, a first-term lawmaker, was ahead of Gray. Duarte took the lead with 52% of the vote, and Gray trailed with 48.75% with 61.73% of the vote counted.      California’s 47th Congressional District:   The race to succeed outgoing Democratic Rep. Katie Porter in California’s 47th Congressional District is also razor-thin.      Republican Scott Baugh, a former Assembly member, and state Sen. Dave Min, a Democrat, are vying for the open seat.      Min has 50% of the vote to Baugh's 49.8% with 79% of the votes counted.      Colorado’s 8th Congressional District   Rep. Yadira Caraveo, a Democrat, is trailing Republican state Rep. Gabe Evans in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District.      With 86% of the votes counted, Evans was ahead of Caraveo. The lead, if sustained, would be a flip for Republicans.      Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said the House is poised to remain in GOP hands, and he has launched his bid to retain the gavel.      Democrats are holding out hope they could win by a razor-thin majority.       House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., wrote on X Thursday it ""has yet to be decided who will control"" the House next year, pointing to ongoing ballot counting in Oregon, Arizona and California.

Trump taps Matt Gaetz for attorney general,"President-elect Trump on Wednesday announced Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as his pick for attorney general — an unexpected pick that took many, including fellow House Republicans, by surprise.      If confirmed, Gaetz will head up the Justice Department after Trump is sworn in for his second term in January.      Trump first announced his nomination in a post on Truth Social, saying Gaetz ""has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice.""      Gaetz confirmed the nomination on the social media site X, adding, ""It will be an honor to serve as President Trump’s Attorney General!""      In his statement on Truth Social, Trump praised Gaetz for his experience on the House Judiciary Committee, where he said Gaetz ""played a key role"" in ""defeating the Russia, Russia Hoax,"" and exposing what Trump described as ""alarming and systemic Government Corruption and Weaponization.""      ""He is a Champion for the Constitution and the Rule of Law,"" he added.      Gaetz graduated from William & Mary College of Law and passed the Florida bar exam in 2008.      News of his appointment was met with a certain level of shock from House lawmakers.      Gaetz, a longtime Trump ally, had been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee, which subpoenaed him as recently as September for an ongoing investigation into alleged sexual misconduct with a minor. Gaetz in response told the panel he would ""no longer voluntarily participate"" in their probe.      ""I explicitly reserve all of my rights pursuant to House Rules and the U.S. Constitution,"" he wrote in the letter, which was shared on social media.      It is unlikely that the investigation itself would block Gaetz's path to confirmation in the Republican-majority Senate, though it could make it more difficult.      Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., who chairs the House Ethics Committee, told Fox News Digital that their investigation would cease as soon as Gaetz leaves the House.       ""Once a member is no longer a member of Congress, then Ethics has no jurisdiction,"" he said.      Guest added: ""Look, I have great trust in President Trump and those people that he will surround himself with and put in his cabinet, so I'm sure that Trump and his transition team have taken into consideration all the good and bad surrounding every one of the candidates that they're looking at appointing, and so I do not question President Trump's appointment at all.""      Still, Guest said that the House Ethics Committee would not ramp up the pace of their investigation in light of Gaetz's nomination. ""No, we're not going to do anything to expedite this,"" he told Fox News.      Early contenders for the post had included sitting U.S. senators, former Justice Department personnel and at least one top White House adviser from Trump's first term.      ""He's going to want someone who he knows, likes and trusts,"" former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker told Fox News about the role last week. ""He's going to want someone who was there from the beginning.""   ",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-taps-matt-gaetz-attorney-general
"Harris concedes presidential race, campaign manager sends letter to staff: 'Losing is unfathomably painful'","Vice President Kamala Harris has connected with former President Donald Trump and conceded the race, according to a letter sent out by her campaign manager stating that ""the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now.""      In a letter obtained by Fox News, campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon states that Harris had called Trump ""to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, unlike what we saw in 2020.""      The letter continues, ""I don’t have words to express the gratitude I have for everyone getting this email. You left everything on the field. You built a first-rate, historic Presidential campaign in basically 90 days. You navigated things that no one has ever had to navigate, and likely no one will ever have to again.""      Dillon said Harris also made clear that she hopes Trump will be a ""President for all Americans.""      ""You stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control. We knew this would be a margin of error race, and it was. And, your work mattered: the whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction,"" Dillon wrote. ""It was closest in the places we competed. That speaks to both the work you did, and the scale of the challenge we ultimately couldn’t surmount.""      ""I’ll leave you with this: losing is unfathomably painful. It is hard. This will take a long time to process. But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,"" Dillon wrote.      ""I know the Vice President isn’t finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission. View this as the beginning, not the end. It will be hard work. But as the boss says: hard work is good work. And I look forward to standing beside you.""      Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung released a statement mentioning Harris' call with Trump.       ""President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris spoke by phone earlier today where she congratulated him on his historic victory,"" Cheung said. ""President Trump acknowledged Vice President Harris on her strength, professionalism, and tenacity throughout the campaign, and both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying the country.""      President Biden reached out by phone and spoke with Harris and congratulated her on a historic campaign, Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reported.      Following his call with Harris, Biden also spoke by phone with Trump and congratulated him on his victory.       During their call, Biden expressed his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and emphasized the importance of working to bring the country together.       He also invited President-elect Trump to meet with him in the White House. The staff will coordinate a specific date in the near future.       Biden is expected to address the nation on Thursday to discuss the election results and the transition.      Trump defeated Harris, who entered the presidential race just over 100 days ago after Biden, who won the Democratic primaries, was convinced to stand down.      Trump will be the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms other than Grover Cleveland, who was elected in 1884 and again in 1892.

Trump Transition Trump appoints Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence: 'Fearless spirit',"President-elect Trump on Wednesday announced that he is appointing Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence in his new Cabinet.      Gabbard served as a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii from 2013 to 2021. In 2022, she became an independent, and joined the GOP last month.      The Republican is also a veteran who served in Iraq, as well as an Army reservist. She was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve three years ago.      In a statement on Wednesday, Trump said that the former congresswoman ""has fought for our Country and the Freedoms of all Americans.""      ""As a former Candidate for the Democrat Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican!"" Trump's statement said.       ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!""      The director of national intelligence leads the U.S. intelligence community, which includes overseeing the National Intelligence Program and advising the president on security matters. The current national intelligence director is Avril Haines.      Once confirmed to the position, Gabbard will advise Trump, the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council on national security matters.      Fox News Digital confirmed earlier on Wednesday that Gabbard was on a shortlist of candidates for the position. In September, the former Democrat told Fox News Digital she would be ""honored"" to join the Trump administration.       ""I feel I can make the most impact in these areas of national security and foreign policy, and work to bring about the changes that President Trump talks about,"" Gabbard said at the time.

"Who is Susie Wiles, Trump's White House chief of staff? 5 things to know","President-elect Donald Trump made history twice this week, first by winning the White House for a second time as a former president, and then by naming Susie Wiles to be his chief of staff.      Wiles, a longtime GOP operative and advisor to Trump, will be the first woman to hold that coveted position in American history. By all accounts, she has earned it. Wiles is credited with tightening up Trump's campaign operations after his 2020 loss and helping him win both the Electoral College and national popular vote in 2024 – an achievement that has eluded Republican candidates for president for 20 years.      ""Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,"" Trump said in a statement on Thursday, announcing her White House appointment.       ""Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,"" he said.      However, while Wiles is known, respected and even feared in Florida, she is not well-known in Washington, D.C., and certainly not nationally. So who is Susie Wiles? Here are five things to know about the next White House chief of staff:       Her father was a legendary NFL broadcaster, and she helped him overcome addiction   Wiles is the daughter of late legendary NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall. Summerall was an NFL champion kicker and the lead color commentator alongside John Madden on CBS for more than two decades.      During his broadcast career, Summerall admitted to becoming an alcoholic. In his 2006 biography, he recounted how his daughter, Susie, staged an intervention for him and helped him break addiction.      ""Dad, the few times we’ve been out in public together recently, I’ve been ashamed we shared the same last name,"" Wiles said in a letter that was read during the intervention, according to Summerall’s 2006 autobiography, ""On and Off the Air.""      Summerall wrote that the words of his daughter inspired him to take steps to address his addiction.       Her first job in politics was with her father's old teammate   In the late 1970s, Wiles was hired as an assistant to Summerall's old teammate on the New York Giants, someone who went on to have a long and successful career in the House of Representatives and later be nominated for vice president. That was none other than the late Jack Kemp, one of the chief backers of former President Ronald Reagan's supply-side economics theories and architect of the Reagan tax cuts.       Wiles went on to work for Reagan himself as a scheduler for his 1980 presidential campaign and later the White House. She left Washington, D.C., for Florida in the 1990s and served as chief of staff to John Delaney, the mayor of Jacksonville. She also worked as the district director for Rep. Tillie Fowler in Northeast Florida.      Delaney heaped praise on Wiles in an interview for Politico Magazine. ""I’ve described her as a political savant — just otherworldly sort of political instincts,"" he said.       Wiles continued to be a fixture of Florida politics for decades, eventually helping a health care executive named Rick Scott become governor in 2010. Scott is now Florida's junior senator and this week is celebrating his re-election to a second term.       She once described herself as a ‘card-carrying member of the GOP establishment,’ but supported Trump   Wiles has worked for every stripe of Republican imaginable, from moderate to hard-line conservative. However, she surprised her friends and allies when, in 2015, she decided to become the Trump campaign's co-chairwoman in Florida.       ""As a card-carrying member of the G.O.P. establishment, many thought my full-throated endorsement of the Trump candidacy was ill advised — even crazy,"" Wiles told the New York Times in a rare public statement.      Though faced with skepticism, Wiles explained to the Tampa Bay Times at the time that she believed no other Republican running for the presidency in 2016 was prepared to deliver the change she felt Washington, D.C., needed. She said national Republicans had developed ""an expediency culture"" and lost sight of core principles.       ""I said, 'I don't want this to continue.' I think it seriously will damage our republic and who among that group can really have the fortitude to shift what I've seen happening over all these years?"" Wiles told the paper.      It turned out that her instincts were right. Trump won the primary and shocked the political establishment by defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in an upset.       She helped Ron DeSantis become governor before a falling out   In 2018, a young Florida congressman named Ron DeSantis decided to run for governor. He won a contested Republican primary thanks to Trump's endorsement, but his campaign was struggling and behind in the polls.      With a little more than a month before the election, DeSantis hired Wiles to right the ship. Her guidance is largely credited with pushing DeSantis over the finish line in a narrow victory over disgraced former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum      However, a rift grew between DeSantis and Wiles after the election. Politico reported that state first lady Casey DeSantis was suspicious of Wiles' growing influence and power in the governor's orbit. Eventually, Wiles was edged out of DeSantis' inner circle.      She wound up back in Trump's orbit for his unsuccessful 2020 campaign and remained a close and valued advisor as he plotted a return to the White House in 2024. She was with the Trump campaign when DeSantis mounted his own campaign for president, and many suspect Trump's team used Wiles' insider knowledge of DeSantis to defeat the Florida governor.      In January, Wiles responded to a report on X that DeSantis had cleared his campaign website of upcoming events.      ""Bye, bye,"" she wrote.      She is a registered lobbyist   In addition to her work on political campaigns, Wiles is a registered lobbyist.       Federal disclosures filed in April show Wiles was a lobbyist for the tobacco company Swisher International while running the Trump campaign. The documents show she worked to influence Congress on ""FDA regulations.""       WIles is the co-chair for the Florida and Washington, D.C., offices of Mercury Public Affairs, a lobbying firm whose clients include AirBnB, AT&T, eBay, Pfizer, Tesla, and the Embassy of Qatar, although she is not a registered lobbyist for any of those clients.       Previously, Wiles worked for Ballard Partners, a Florida-based firm started by lobbyist Brian Ballard.

Fox News Voter Analysis: Is this a change election? Top issues and mood of the nation as voters weigh in,"As the nation waits for election results, voters weigh in on the issues and whether former president Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris will bring the kind of change they are looking for. Because it appears change is very much what they want.      Economic concerns and worries about the future are major considerations as voters make their choice in this year’s election.       Preliminary data from the Fox News Voter Analysis, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide provide an early look at the mood of voters as they cast their ballots.         This year, more voters headed to the polls believing the country was on the wrong track (70%) than in 2020 (60%).  And voters across the country are seeking something different: most want a change in how the country is run, with a quarter (26%) seeking complete and total upheaval.      Voters’ frustrations with the Biden administration were readily apparent, as more than 5 in 10 disapprove of the job he is doing.      By contrast, voters had net-positive recollections of Donald Trump’s time in office, with over half approving of the job he did as president. Four years ago, 47% approved of the job Trump had done.      This desire for change is coupled with split views on the role of government. Slightly more than half say the government should be doing more to solve the country’s problems, a modest decline from 2020 (57%). Nearly as many (45%) think the government is doing too many things better left to the private sector.       Voters say the economy is far and away the top issue facing the country, followed distantly by immigration and abortion.      Four in 10 voters say inflation was the single most important factor to their vote.       Voters have dismal evaluations of the economy: two-thirds rated it as fair (40%) or downright poor (23%). Four years ago, in the depths of a coronavirus-induced recession, only 14% said economic conditions were poor.      In a sign of inflation’s economic toll, roughly three times as many voters feel they were falling behind financially as feel they were getting ahead. Four years ago, roughly the same number said that they were getting ahead, however, the number who said they were falling behind was just 18% in 2020.      Being able to afford food (67%) was the main budgetary concern for more voters than health care (54%), housing (51%), and gas (48%).       On balance, voters had slightly more favorable views of Harris (48% favorable, 49% unfavorable) as a person than Trump (46% favorable, 52% unfavorable). The same is true at the vice-presidential level: views of Tim Walz (43% favorable, 41% unfavorable) were slightly better than opinions of JD Vance (42% favorable, 46% unfavorable). Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ended his third-party presidential bid and endorsed Trump in August, was less popular than the two running mates (41% favorable, 43% unfavorable).      The spotlight is not kind to Biden, whose sharply negative favorability rating (40% favorable, 57% unfavorable) slipped significantly from four years ago (50% favorable, 48% unfavorable).       2024 FNVA Methodology Statement:      The Fox News Voter Analysis, conducted in partnership with the Associated Press, provides a comprehensive look at voting behavior, opinions, and preferences as America votes. It is based on surveys of the U.S. electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with voting results from The Associated Press. For the 2024 General Election, the FNVA results are based on a probability sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files, samples of self-identified registered voters from a probability-based national panel, and samples of self-identified registered voters from opt-in online panels. The FNVA survey of the American electorate was conducted in all 50 states, October 28 to November 5, concluding at the end of voting on Election Day.

"Trump's speedy Cabinet picks show his 'priority to put America first,' transition team says","President-elect Donald Trump has announced more than a dozen Cabinet picks just a week after he was declared victorious in his race against Vice President Kamala Harris, reflecting his commitment to putting ""America first,"" the campaign told Fox News Digital.       ""The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin, giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail — and his Cabinet picks reflect his priority to put America First. President Trump will continue to appoint highly qualified men and women who have the talent, experience and necessary skill sets to Make America Great Again,"" Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital when asked about Trump's speedy roll-out of Cabinet picks.       Trump sailed to victory last week after securing electoral votes from toss-up states such as Pennsylvania and Georgia. All in, he earned 312 electoral votes — sweeping all seven of the battleground states — and won the popular vote.       ""America first"" and ""Make America Great Again"" were hallmarks of Trump's campaign, including during his historic rally at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan last month.      ""We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of the U.S.A. With your help from now until Election Day, we will restore America's promise. We will put America first, and we will take back the nation that we all love,"" he said at MSG. ""We bleed the same blood. We share the same home, and we salute the same great American flag. We are one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never ever back down, and we will never, ever, ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight, and we will win, win, win.""      Shortly after his win at the ballot box, Trump began rolling out his picks for his Cabinet. As of Wednesday afternoon, Trump has announced 17 names for his administration, including Susie Wiles as his chief of staff, longtime ally Dan Scavino as his deputy chief of staff and Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense.      Trump has announced the picks via emails to the media and supporters, coming at a faster pace than in 2016, when he was elected to his first term in the Oval Office, Fox News Digital found earlier this week.        Trump announced on Nov. 11, for example, that New York Rep. Elise Stefanik will serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. During the 2016 transition cycle, Trump announced then-Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina would fill that same role on Nov. 23. Haley went on to run unsuccessfully in 2024 for the GOP presidential nomination.      He also tapped Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., to serve as his national security adviser, announcing that pick on Tuesday, about three days ahead of his announcement for the same role in 2016, when he chose former Army Gen. Mike Flynn for the position about 10 days after Election Day.      Trump also announced he chose former New York Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a pick Trump didn’t make until Dec. 7, 2016, when he tapped Scott Pruitt to serve in the role.      Trump's first pick for his administration, Susie Wiles for chief of staff, was announced the day after the election, while his 2016 announcement of Reince Priebus as chief of staff was made five days after the election.      ""Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,"" Trump said after the selection of Wiles.      Trump briefly traveled to Washington, D.C., Wednesday, where he met with congressional Republicans and then went to the White House for a meeting with President Biden before heading back home to Florida.      ""I look forward… to having a smooth transition. We'll do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, what you need,"" Biden said during a short portion of the meeting when reporters were granted access to the Oval Office.       Trump added that ""politics is tough, and in many cases it’s not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today.""      ""I appreciate very much the transition that's so smooth. It will be as smooth as it can get, and I very much appreciate that,"" Trump continued.      Trump was joined by high-profile officials on his transition team and upcoming administration, including Wiles and tech billionaire Elon Musk.      Musk endorsed Trump over the summer and soon began campaigning for him, most notably in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump announced on Tuesday evening that Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new task force he is calling the Department of Government Efficiency.       ""I am pleased to announce that the Great Elon Musk, working in conjunction with American Patriot Vivek Ramaswamy, will lead the Department of Government Efficiency (""DOGE""). Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the ‘Save America’ Movement,"" Trump said in his announcement.       ""It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time. Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of ""DOGE"" for a very long time. To drive this kind of drastic change, the Department of Government Efficiency will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before,"" the announcement continued.       Trump is expected to continue quickly announcing his Cabinet picks as he continues establishing his administration ahead of Jan. 20. Trump had pledged throughout the campaign to ""make America great again"" for voters of all political stripes, putting emphasis on gutting some federal agencies and even dismantling them altogether, such as the Department of Education.

Early voting data may be sign of improved GOP ground game in pivotal swing state: expert,"The critical swing state of Michigan has seen record-breaking early voting numbers so far, with data on Republican turnout improved significantly over 2020 in what could be a good sign for former President Trump and Republicans, one expert says. ""The numbers we are seeing out of Michigan are encouraging for Republicans across the board,"" Jimmy Keady, the founder and president of JLK Political Strategies, a Republican consulting firm, told Fox News Digital.      Keady’s comments come as over 1.2 million voters in Michigan have already cast a ballot in this year’s election, according to data on the Michigan Department of State’s dashboard, taking advantage of either early voting and mail-in balloting while shattering the previous record for early ballot returns in the state.      While early voting data can give a look at what party a voter is registered to, it doesn’t necessarily mean that voter chose the candidate affiliated with that party in this election. The data also comes two weeks before Election Day, with plenty of time for trends to shift between now and Nov. 5.      Roughly 17% of the state’s over 7 million registered voters have already returned a ballot, the data shows, with another roughly 1 million requested absentee ballots yet to be returned.      While Michigan does not publicly track party registration like some states, data provided on NBC News by Target Smart estimates that 53% of ballots returned so far in Michigan have been from Democrats, while 37% have been from Republicans and 10% from ""other.""      But according to Keady, those numbers show improved Republican turnout, a welcome sign for a Trump campaign hopeful to bank votes ahead of Election Day itself.      ""While Democrats are maintaining their lead in ballot chasing, Republicans are not far behind, and they are outperforming previous election cycles,"" Keady said, noting that it will still be ""hard to say what impact these numbers will have on the outcome.""      ""What we are seeing on the ground is that Republicans are actively drawing out more low propensity voters than Democrats,"" Keady added.      Over 21.5 million mail-in and early in-person votes have already been cast nationwide as of Wednesday, the Target Smart data shows, with 45% of those coming from Democrats, 38% of Republicans, and 17% from other voters.      Keady believes two key states to watch will be Michigan and Nevada, another of the seven swing states, where straight ticket voting could play a critical role in down-ballot races.      ""A key aspect of this election cycle will be straight ticket voting,"" Keady said. ""Nevada and Michigan are the only two swing states – and two out of seven states nationally — that allow straight ticket voting. In places like Michigan where the top of the ticket is outperforming down-ballot races, there is a good chance that straight ticket voting will help Senate, Congressional, and statewide races.""      Keady also warned against reading too much into the partisan advantage for Democrats, noting that many of Trump’s supporters are likely to be union voters who traditionally have supported Democrats but will support Trump in 2024.      ""It’s important to remember the impact union voters will have on this election,"" Keady said. ""Many union members are registered Democrats. Without the union support for Harris, there are going to be a lot of disenchanted union members that switch their votes this year for Republicans.""

"House balance of power still undecided a week after Election Day, with Republicans needing 4 more seats","One week after Election Day, control of the House of Representatives is still up in the air with votes continuing to be counted in 17 House races.      Republican Donald Trump won the presidency again and the GOP will have the Senate majority. House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, is still waiting to learn whether he will get to keep his job and President-elect Trump will soon find out whether Republicans will have full control of the government to enact his agenda over the next two years (before the 2026 midterm elections).      Here's where things stand with the uncalled House races:       Alaska   At-large district   Democratic incumbent Rep. Mary Sattler Peltola is in a tight race in Alaska’s at-large congressional district, where she is trailing Republican entrepreneur Nick Begich.      As of Tuesday morning, Begich holds a 4-point lead at 49.5% of the vote compared to Peltola's 45.5%. The vote count sits at 125,222 to 115,089, with roughly 80% of the vote counted.      Arizona   6th Congressional District   The race in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District is tight, with the Republican candidate narrowly ahead.       Republican Rep. Juan Ciscomani, a first-term lawmaker, is barely leading former Democratic state lawmaker Kirsten Engel in a 49.5% to 48.2% race as of Tuesday morning. The vote count sits at 189,692 to 184,787 with 86% of votes counted.      California   9th Congressional District   Democratic incumbent Josh Harder leads Republican challenger Kevin Lincoln by fewer than 3 points.      The district had about 74% of the vote recorded as of Tuesday, and Harder's lead expanded to 7,124 votes.       13th Congressional District   Republican Rep. John Duarte is leading former Democratic state assembly member Adam Gray in California’s 13th Congressional District, but the highly contested race remains uncalled as of Tuesday.      Roughly 62% of the vote has been counted, and Duarte holds a 51.1% to 48.9% lead. The pair is separated by just under 3,000 votes.      21st Congressional District   Incumbent Democratic Rep. Jim Costa leads his Republican challenger, Michael Maher, in a 50.5% to 49.5% race as of Tuesday morning.      So far, 66% of the vote has been counted, and Costa's lead is just over 1,000 votes.      22nd Congressional District   Republican incumbent Rep. David Valado leads Democratic Challenger Rudy Salas in a 53.6% to 46.6% race as of Tuesday. Valado holds a lead of just under 10,000 votes with 77% of the vote counted.      27th Congressional District   Republican incumbent Rep. Mike Garcia is trailing Democratic challenger George Whitesides by about 2 points as of Tuesday morning.      With 83% of the votes counted, Whitesides' lead sits at just under 7,000 votes.      Though the race has not been called, Garcia conceded in a statement Monday evening.      ""I spoke with George Whitesides this evening to congratulate him, and I will ensure a smooth handoff of open constituent case work packages to him and his team,"" Garcia said.       41st Congressional District   Republican incumbent Rep. Ken Calvert holds a 51.3% to 48.7% lead over Democratic challenger Will Rollins. Roughly 75% of the vote has been counted as of Tuesday, and Calvert's lead sits at roughly 7,500 votes.      45th Congressional District   Incumbent Republican Rep. Michelle Steel leads her Democratic challenger Derek Tran with 50.7% of the vote as of Tuesday. A little more than 83% of the votes have been counted, and Steel's lead has shrunk to 3,908 votes.      47th Congressional District   The race to succeed outgoing Democratic Rep. Katie Porter in California’s 47th Congressional District is also razor-thin.      Republican Scott Baugh, a former state assembly member, and state Sen. Dave Min, a Democrat, are vying for the open seat, and Min holds a about a 1% lead.      Nearly 82% of the vote has been counted, and Min's lead sits at just over 3,000 votes.      49th Congressional District   Democratic incumbent Rep. Mike Levin holds a 4-point lead over Republican challenger Matt Gunderson as of Tuesday morning.      With 82% of votes counted, Levin's lead sits at roughly 14,000 votes.      Colorado   8th Congressional District   Rep. Yadira Caraveo, a Democrat, is trailing Republican state Rep. Gabe Evans in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District by less than 1% with 96% of the vote counted.      Caraveo conceded on Sunday evening, and Evans has declared victory, though the AP has not yet called the race.      Iowa   1st Congressional District   Republican incumbent Rep. Mariannet Miller-Meeks holds a less than 1% lead over challenger Christina Bohannan with 99% of the vote counted. Miller-Meeks' lead sits at just under 1,000 votes.      Maine   2nd Congressional District   Democratic incumbent Jared Golden holds a razor-thin lead over Republican challenger Austin Theriault as of Tuesday.      With 98% of the votes counted, Golden's lead sits at less than 800 votes.      Ohio   9th Congressional District   Democratic incumbent Marcy Kaptur leads her Republican challenger, Derek Merrin, by less than 1 point with 99% of the votes counted. Kaptur's lead sits at just over 1,000 votes as of Tuesday.      Oregon   5th Congressional District   Republican incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer is trailing her Democratic challenger, Janelle Bynum by nearly 3 points with 87% of the votes counted Tuesday.      Bynum's lead sits at just over 10,000 votes.      Washington   4th Congressional District   Republican incumbent Rep. Dan Newhouse leads his top opponent, fellow Republican Jerrod Sessler, by about 5 points with 86% of the votes counted.      Newhouse's lead sits at just over 13,000 votes as of Tuesday morning.

Iran denies involvement in Trump assassination plot outlined in DOJ report: 'Malicious conspiracy',"Iran's Foreign Ministry dismissed a report released by the Department of Justice on Friday stating that it thwarted an Iranian plot to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump.      A criminal complaint filed in a New York City federal court stated that an unnamed official in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps told Farhad Shakeri, 51, of Iran, to ""focus on surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating, former President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.""      ""Shakeri has informed law enforcement that he was tasked on Oct. 7, 2024, with providing a plan to kill President-elect Donald J. Trump,"" it added.      On Saturday, spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei ""categorically dismissed allegations that Iran was involved in attempts to assassinate former and current US officials,"" according to the foreign ministry.      Baghaei, who described the report as ""completely baseless and rejected,"" said Iran has been accused of similar scenarios in the past that have been ""firmly denied and proven false.""      He said that repeating these types of claims ""is a malicious conspiracy orchestrated by Zionist and anti-Iranian circles, aimed at further complicating the issues between the US and Iran.""      Baghaei concluded by saying Iran ""remains committed"" to using ""all legitimate and legal means"" at domestic and international levels to ""restore the rights of the Iranian nation.""      Shakeri, who remains at large and is believed to be living in Iran, ""immigrated to the United States as a child and was deported in or about 2008 after serving 14 years in prison for a robbery conviction,"" according to the DOJ.      Shakeri is also accused of tasking two New York men, 49-year-old Carlisle Rivera and 36-year-old Jonathon Loadholt, with surveilling and killing an American of Iranian origin — who ""is an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime"" — for $100,000.       The person, who identified herself as journalist Masih Alinejad, lives in America and has also been targeted by the Iranian government, the DOJ report said.      ""We will not stand for the Iranian regime’s attempts to endanger the American people and America’s national security,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.      Shakeri, Rivera and Loadholt face charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and money laundering conspiracy, which carry maximum penalties of 10 to 20 years in prison.       Prosecutors said Shakeri has also been charged with conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and sanctions against the Government of Iran, which each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.",9-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-denies-involvement-trump-assassination-plot-outlined-doj-report-malicious-conspiracy
Special Counsel Jack Smith moves to drop Trump election interference case,"Special Counsel Jack Smith on Friday filed a motion to vacate all deadlines in the 2020 election interference case against President-elect Trump in Washington, D.C., a widely expected move, but one that stops short of dropping the case against him completely.      The filing from Smith was widely expected following Trump's election to a second term, and is in keeping with longstanding Department of Justice policy against bringing criminal charges against a sitting president.       While the case has not been officially dropped, it appears to be moving in that direction. Smith said Friday that his team plans to give an updated report on the official status of the case against Trump on Dec. 2.      The news is likely a welcome relief for Trump, who vowed to fire Smith ""within two seconds"" if re-elected — ridding him of both a yearlong legal foe and the criminal charges Trump faced following his loss in the 2020 election.      Smith was tapped by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to investigate both the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as Trump's keeping of allegedly classified documents at his residence in Florida after leaving the White House in 2020.      Fox News reported earlier this week that the Department of Justice had been looking to wind down its criminal cases against Trump in Washington, D.C., and Florida, citing an Office of Legal Counsel memo that states it is against Department of Justice policy to investigate a sitting president for federal criminal charges and is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.       Smith had indicted Trump in D.C. earlier this year on charges stemming from the former president's alleged efforts to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election.      He also brought federal charges against Trump in Florida for his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House.      Former Attorney General Bill Barr told Fox News Digital earlier this week that Smith should immediately halt the federal cases in both D.C. and Florida, citing DOJ policy.      While Trump still faces state cases in Georgia and New York, Barr said this week that local prosecutors and judges need to move on from the ""spectacle"" of prosecuting the president-elect.      ""Further maneuvering on these cases in the weeks ahead would serve no legitimate purpose and only distract the country and the incoming administration from the task at hand,"" Barr said.       Next week, the presiding judge in the New York case is expected to announce whether the state will proceed with felony conviction proceedings against Trump in the final months before he takes office, or whether to apply claims of presidential immunity expanded by the Supreme Court earlier this year.",8-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/special-counsel-jack-smith-moves-drop-trump-election-interference-case

Matt Gaetz faces GOP Senate opposition after Trump selection for attorney general,"President-elect Trump's latest selection for his next administration is facing immediate backlash from some within the Senate GOP, as they say his attorney general pick, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., will not get confirmed.       ""He will never get confirmed,"" a Republican senator, granted anonymity to speak freely, told Fox News Digital.       One Senate Republican source simply said, ""Ain’t gonna happen,"" about the prospect of Gaetz's confirmation.       Gaetz's office referred Fox News Digital to his response on X, ""It will be an honor to serve as President Trump’s Attorney General!"" and did not comment on the GOP criticism about his potential confirmation.       Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters, ""I think we have to consider any nominee by the president seriously, but we also have a constitutional responsibility.""       He was prompted about whether the House Ethics investigation currently being conducted into Gaetz would factor in to his confirmation, to which the senator replied: ""That might come up.""      The allegations being probed by the committee include sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and accepting improper gifts.      Responding to the announcement of Gaetz's selection for attorney general, Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., who chairs the Ethics Committee, said that ""once a member is no longer a member of Congress, then ethics has no jurisdiction. So if Matt Gaetz were to be appointed as the Attorney General, the ethics investigation [which] is currently ongoing would cease at that point.""      However, Senate Republicans were not explicitly supportive. ""He’s under investigation by the House Committee on Ethics,"" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, acknowledged. ""Obviously, the president has the right to nominate whomever he wishes, but this is why the background checks that are done by the FBI and the advice and consent process in the Senate, and public hearings are also important.""      ""He will go through the nomination process just like everyone else,"" said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.      Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., told reporters, ""I got nothing for you on that,"" when asked about Trump's choice.      ""I think what we can tell you right now is that we always allow the President to have the benefit of the doubt, but we still have to do our role in terms of due diligence,"" said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., when asked if he would vote to confirm Gaetz.       In addition to the ethics investigation, Gaetz was at one point being investigated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a yearslong probe into sex trafficking allegations. But last year, Gaetz's office said the DOJ ended their investigation and determined he would not be charged with any crimes.       While Republicans could very well be poised not to confirm Gaetz, who has proven controversial among his own party, Trump could look to appoint him through a recess appointment. The president-elect made an appeal to Senate Republican leader candidates earlier this week, telling them they must agree to allow him to make such appointments.       Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., who won the leader election on Wednesday morning, signaled being open to this in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital. However, he didn't commit to it.       ""We must act quickly and decisively to get the president’s cabinet and other nominees in place as soon as possible to start delivering on the mandate we’ve been sent to execute, and all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments,"" he said.       If Trump were successful in appointing a cabinet member through a recess appointment, they would be able to serve in the role for nearly two years, according to the Congressional Research Service. The appointment would expire once the next session of Congress, following the recess, adjourns.       ""Recess appointments expire at the end of the next session of the Senate,"" according to a recent CRS report. ""As a result, a recess appointment may last for less than a year or nearly two years, depending on when the appointment is made.""",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/matt-gaetz-faces-gop-senate-opposition-after-trump-selection-attorney-general
Fox News projects former President Trump to win Michigan,"The Fox News Decision Desk projects that former President Trump has won the critical swing state of Michigan over Vice President Kamala Harris. These 15 electoral votes will add to Trump's projected victory in the 2024 race.       Michigan, part of the so-called ""Blue Wall"" states that includes Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, was one of the most valuable targets for both candidates in this year’s race. Trump is projected to win the presidential election, and adds the pickup in Michigan to his total.      Long known as a Democratic stronghold, Michigan had not gone to a Republican candidate since the late former President George H.W. Bush won the state in 1988. Trump ended that streak in 2016, narrowly defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by less than one percentage point on his way to the White House.      President Biden took the state back for Democrats in 2020 in another tight battle, restoring the Blue Wall along the way by also capturing similarly tight victories in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.      Both candidates realized the value to the state for their prospects of winning in 2024, with Michigan receiving over double the amount of campaign events from both campaigns than it saw in 2016 and 2020 before the calendar even flipped to November.       Michigan was one of seven swing states that were viewed as the most vital to winning the election, with the others being Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Combined, the seven states award 93 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-projects-former-president-trump-win-michigan
More than half of Harris voters want to relocate following Trump win: survey,"More than 50% of voters for Vice President Kamala Harris say they want to move following Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election, according to a survey commissioned by StorageUnits.com.      Storage Units surveyed 1,837 Harris voters on Nov. 6 to determine how many would like to relocate – and who actually plans to – and the top concerns of those who voted against Trump.      Of those surveyed, 44% would like to move, but probably won't, while 5% said they will definitely move and another 5% said they probably will. Those who would like to move, but probably won't, cited personal finances, family and community ties as reasons they will stay in place.      Of the 10% planning to move or seriously considering it, 90% are looking into moving to another country, with the top choices being Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico. California, New York and Colorado were the top three choices for those considering moving to another state.      According to the survey, the top three reasons Harris voters want to relocate are concerns that a federal abortion ban will be enacted, an increase in racial inequality and progressive rights will be overturned.      Abortion access at the federal level, which was one of the Democrats' top campaign issues, has been an area of concern for many Dem voters despite Trump stating he would not enact a federal abortion ban and reiterating that he agrees with the decision being left in the states' hands after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court on June 24, 2022.      Other top areas of concern include: reduction in healthcare access, increased social inequality, lack of gun regulation and the weakening of public education.      ""Some Harris voters who are experiencing fear, anxiety, and concern following the election results may elect to shift from a red to a blue state with friendlier LGBTQ+ and/or less restrictive abortion laws. However, there are a number of factors influencing any potential moves, such as cost of living, job availability, and housing prices,"" Realtor Jo Ann Bauer told Storage Units.      Of all the generations surveyed, Gen Z had the highest number of Harris voters saying they will definitely or probably move (nearly 20%) when compared to Millennials, Gen Xers and Boomers.       Gen Z also had the least number of participants say they have ""no interest in moving"" at about 30%.      Trump won the 2024 election decisively, garnering at least 301 electoral votes over Harris' 226 and beating Harris by more than 5 million in the popular vote.",9-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/more-than-half-harris-voters-want-relocate-following-trump-win-survey
"Estimated 500,000-plus ballots still uncounted in Arizona: 'Elections do not end on Election Day'","Election Day is long gone, but Arizonans and Americans across the nation are still waiting for results from the Grand Canyon State, including the outcome of the closely watched U.S. Senate contest pitting Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego against Trump-backed Republican Kari Lake.      ""Elections do not end on Election Day. It takes time to ensure all eligible votes are counted,"" the state's ballot progress page states.      According to the page, the estimated number of uncounted ballots stands at 588,223.       While Election Day was Tuesday, the outcome of the Senate race in the state of Arizona remained unclear as of Saturday. Fox News and all other major news outlets have already called Arizona for Donald Trump, who is nearly 200,000 votes ahead of Kamala Harris.       Fox News Digital reached out to request a comment from Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes about why it is taking so long to count 2024 election ballots in the state and when he expects the counting process to be completed.      Deputy communications director JP Martin replied via email, ""Arizona has historically taken 10-13 days to count results. The secretary has been reminding the public of this fact before the election even occurred. Your premise is incorrect.""      ""Accurate election results take time,"" Fontes noted in a post on X. ""Signature verification is the process of comparing the sig. on a voter’s ballot envelope against info in the database.

""I can't stress enough how important ballot curing is. Every single vote is going to count for this election, so we need to make sure every single vote gets counted. We have until Sunday to cure ballots. I URGE you to get involved if you haven't,"" Lake tweeted.      Lake's post links to Turning Point Action.      Tyler Bowyer, the group's Chief Operating Officer, told Fox News Digital that the group is ""hustling"" to ensure ballots are cured in Arizona.

For your ballot to be tabulated, we must have a verified signature each election cycle. There is a small window of time to cure signature issues.""       The winner of the U.S. Senate contest will replace Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat turned independent who opted not to seek re-election in 2024.

Jake Paul endorses Trump in fiery video torching Biden-Harris administration: ‘Can’t sit back and watch this’,"Jake Paul has taken time outside of preparations for his upcoming bout against boxing legend Mike Tyson next month to speak out on the upcoming presidential elections, encouraging voters to educate themselves in order to ""quite literally save America.""       The YouTuber-turned-boxer posted a lengthy video on social media Thursday opening up about his thoughts on the current state of politics in the U.S. and who he believes will be the best fit for president.      Paul opened his video saying that by moving to Puerto Rico to pursue his boxing career, he has ""rescinded"" his right to vote in the upcoming election, but that he hopes to still use his platform to provide voters with information ""to encourage them to vote in the proper direction to quite literally save America.""       ""Uh nervous, scared to make this video because of what it means in terms of my career, my life, people coming after me, more accusations, more turmoil, more division potentially. However, I just want to provide information to the potentially undecided voter [about] the things that I have seen over the last couple of years that have led me in a certain direction as to who I am supporting in this presidential election,"" he began.       ""And most of all, encouraging y’all to actually vote, encouraging y’all to actually do your own research, and to base that research in the truth – not just reckless propaganda or your favorite pop star telling you to vote a certain way and you believing them because you love their song.""       Paul called out the divisiveness of this election cycle, which he said prompted him to speak out.       ""I believe love is the key to the universe and that we should all love each other more and more and more, and it saddens me that in the current political state of the world, in America people can’t have opinions without outrageous backlash… It shows that we are more divided than ever and I can’t sit back and watch this blasphemy unfold in front of me any longer.""       Paul defended former President Donald Trump, specifically over the recent controversy surrounding comedian Tony Hinchcliffe for remarks he made during his appearance at a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden over the weekend.      ""Don’t judge people off of a character that the media has portrayed them to be because Democrats control 90% of the U.S. media, so they will paint a picture to y’all and that picture is what they want you to see.""       Paul pointed to several statistics about the economy under the Biden-Harris administration in comparison to Trump’s presidency and called on voters to vote for change.       ""Democrats have been in power for 12 of the last 16 years. So, if we aren’t happy with the current political state, economic state, environmental state, then who is to blame?""       Paul also addressed a number of other topics including women’s reproductive rights, transgender athletes competing in women’s sports, and protecting women’s spaces.

"Susie Wiles, the 'ice baby,' is a top contender for Trump's chief of staff, sources say","Speculation is surging that Susie Wiles, a veteran political operative who worked closely with President-elect Trump during his campaign, could take a top position in his new administration.      Sources within Trump's transition team and others close to the former president's campaign confirmed to Fox News that Wiles is reportedly the frontrunner for White House chief of staff — the person who oversees the Executive Office of the President.      Trump, during his victory celebration in West Palm Beach, Florida, late Tuesday night, gave special thanks to Wiles for her prominent role throughout the campaign.       ""Let me also express my tremendous appreciation for Susie [Wiles] and Chris [LaCivita], the job you did. Susie, come, Susie,"" Trump said, inviting her up to the microphone, but Wiles refrained from making comments.      ""Susie likes to stay sort of in the back, let me tell you. The ice baby. We call her the ice baby. Susie likes to stay in the background. She's not in the background,"" Trump added. ""Thank you, Susie.""      NBC News also reported that Wiles is seen as the frontrunner to become Trump’s chief of staff. Two sources in Trump’s political orbit didn't wave Fox News off the reporting.      Wiles' decades-long political career stretches back to working as former President Reagan's campaign scheduler for his 1980 presidential bid.      Wiles managed several campaigns throughout her political career, including former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.'s presidential campaign and Florida Sen. Rick Scott's Senate bid.      The Florida-based consultant successfully managed the operations for Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns in the Sunshine State, contributing to his victories in Florida during both elections. In between presidential cycles, Wiles helped Ron DeSantis with his 2018 bid for governor.      Wiles currently serves as a senior adviser to Trump and is campaign co-chair alongside Chris LaCivita. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was previously floated as a possible contender for chief of staff, but recently told ""The Guy Benson Show"" that he would not take the position if it was offered.       ""People always ask if I'm going to be chief of staff — no, I'm not going to be... that's a no,"" he said.

Biden to lobby Trump not to abandon Ukraine during upcoming meeting,"President Biden will urge President-elect Trump to not abandon Ukraine when the two meet on Wednesday, among other domestic and foreign policies, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Sunday.      On Tuesday, Trump defeated Vice President Harris in the presidential election, and he will take office on Jan. 20, 2025. After Trump won his way back into the Oval Office, Biden congratulated him and invited the 45th, and soon to be 47th, president of the United States to the White House to ensure a peaceful transition of power. The two are expected to meet this Wednesday.      On Sunday, Sullivan was a guest on CBS News’ ""Face the Nation"" where he said Biden’s top message would be ensuring his commitment to a peaceful transfer of power. Sullivan also said the president will talk to Trump about what is happening around the world in places like Europe, Asia and the Middle East.      ""The president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these issues when he takes office,"" Sullivan said. ""President Biden made clear when [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full, meaning that by Jan. 20th we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine that Congress has authorized.""      He continued by saying that over the next 70 days, Biden will make the case to Congress and the incoming administration that the U.S. should not walk away from Ukraine, because walking away ""means more instability in Europe.""      ""Ultimately, as the Japanese prime minister said, if we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow,"" Sullivan said.      He would not say if Biden would propose specific legislation, but he explained that the president would make the case to continue sending resources to Ukraine beyond his term because Russia’s threat to Ukraine will remain.      ""The United States should not walk away from its commitment either to Ukraine or to the 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine, in both Europe and Asia,"" Sullivan said.      The national security adviser’s comments came as Ukraine launched an attack on Moscow with at least 34 drones on Sunday. The attack was the biggest drone strike on the Russian capital since the beginning of the war.      Trump has insisted that Russian President Vladimir Putin would never have invaded Ukraine if he were in the White House at the time. He also told Reuters that Ukraine may have to cede territory in order to reach a peace agreement, which Ukraine rejects and Biden has never suggested.      Washington has provided tens of billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticized and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers.      According to the Government Accountability Office, Congress appropriated over $174 billion to Ukraine under Biden. The pace of aid is almost sure to drop under Trump, with Republicans set to take control of the U.S. Senate with a 53-seat majority.      The war in Ukraine is entering what some officials say could be its final act after Moscow's forces advanced at the fastest pace since the early days of the war.      Any fresh attempt to end the war is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, which have not been held since the early months of the war.      Moscow's forces occupy around a fifth of Ukraine. Russia says the war cannot end until its claimed annexations are recognized. Kyiv demands all of its territory back, a position that has largely been supported by Western allies.

"Biden stumbles through event, refers to former Rep. Giffords in past tense: 'nothing wrong with me'","President Biden sparked confusion during a mumbling saga, remarking that there was ‘nothing wrong’ with him as he discussed Sen. Mark Kelly's wife in the past tense.      ""I'm Joe Biden, I'm Jill Biden's husband. And God, thank you for the introduction to the Gila Indian River community here… the Gila… nothing wrong with me. The Gila River Indian community for welcoming me today,"" he said while visiting the Indian Reserve on Friday.      ""You know, I say this with all sincerity, this, to me, is the most consequential thing I've ever had the opportunity to do in my whole career as President of the United States,"" he said. ""It's an honor, a genuine honor, to be in this special place on this special day.""      Biden offered Sen. Mark Kelly, D-AZ, a shoutout, and then referred to Kelly's wife, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, D-AZ, in the past tense.      ""It is an honor, a genuine honor to be in this special place on this special day,"" he added. ""Thank you to Senator Mark Kelly, a great friend who also was married to an incredible woman [Giffords] who was my friend.""      While the former Arizona politician was one of the victims in a 2011 mass shooting that took place in Tucson, she survived the tragic event that claimed six lives.      Following the assassination attempt, she chose to resign from her position.      The 54-year-old is still alive and is married to Sen. Kelly since 2007.      Biden's gaffes include mixing up world leaders with dead people. In Feb. 2024, the president claimed he spoke with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl – who actually died four years earlier.      White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended President Biden's gaffe with Chancellor Kohl, telling the press that it ""happens to all of us, and it is common."" ""As it relates to the names and what he was trying to say, many people, elected officials, many people, you know, they can misspeak sometimes, right?"" she said.       ""And so this happens. You know, it happens to all of us and it is common,"" Jean-Pierre argued. ""But I do want to make sure we don't forget what the overall arching kind of theme, what he is trying to say about our leadership on the global stage.""

Harris paid Oprah $1 million in failed bid to help campaign: report,"Vice President Kamala Harris paid Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Productions $1 million, just one example of millions the campaign spent on various entertainers during the vice president’s failed bid for president.      The Harris campaign paid $1 million to Winfrey’s company on October 15, according to a report in the Washington Examiner, coming after a star-studded town hall that Winfrey hosted for the vice president in September.      Winfrey also appeared at Harris’ final rally in Philadelphia on the eve of Election Day, with the talk-show star offering a rare endorsement of a presidential candidate.      ""We’re voting for values and integrity,"" Winfrey said at the rally. ""We’re voting for healing over hate.""      But Winfrey wasn’t the only star the Harris campaign spent big money on, with the Washington Examiner report also revealing that the campaign spent big on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.       ""A source familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner that the Harris campaign spent six figures on building a set for Harris’s appearance on the popular Call Her Daddy podcast with host Alex Cooper,"" the Examiner wrote. ""The interview came out in October and was reportedly filmed in a hotel room in Washington, D.C.""      The campaign also spent up to $20 million on swing state concerns on the eve of the election, according to a report in the New York Post, a sum that could have been more if a planned performance by Alanis Morissette had not been scrapped.      The campaign had seven swing-state concerts on Monday, the report noted, including performances by Jon Bon Jovi in Detroit, Christina Aguilera in Las Vegas, Katy Perry in Pittsburgh and Lady Gaga in Philadelphia, and a 2 Chainz performance at a rally three days before the election in Atlanta.      ""Money can’t buy you love or a good candidate,"" Republican political strategist Brad Todd told the Examiner, with regard to the massive spending.      ""Advertising is a pretty important source of information for swing voters,"" Todd said. ""It no doubt matters, but it’s not enough. It doesn’t matter if you have the wrong message and it’s not delivered in a compelling way. What her campaign was missing was any effort to break with the unpopular administration she has been a part of.""

World leaders react to Trump victory 'on history's greatest comeback',"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first world leaders to congratulate former President Trump on his stunning political comeback victory on Wednesday.      Netanyahu, who is leading a seven-front existential war against Iran’s regime and its proxies, wrote on X, ""Dear Donald and Melania Trump, Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback! Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory! In true friendship, yours, Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu.""      Fox News projected Trump as the winner of the presidential election in the early hours of Wednesday morning.      An array of world leaders also chimed in to congratulate Trump on X. French President Emmanuel Macron said on X, ""Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump . Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.""       Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban wrote, ""The biggest comeback in US political history! Congratulations to President @realDonaldTrump on his enormous win. A much needed victory for the World!""       Orban, like Trump, is a proponent of strict border control.      British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stressed that the U.S. and the U.K. are the ""closest of allies"" and noted that the ""US-UK special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come."" He wrote, ""Congratulations President-elect @realDonaldTrump on your historic election victory. I look forward to working with you in the years ahead.""       Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who like Netanyahu, is leading his country in an existential war, stated on X, ""Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump on his impressive election victory! I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine.""       He added, ""I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together. We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership. We rely on continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States.""

Trump expected to 'soon' appoint a Ukrainian peace envoy after promises of negotiating end to war with Russia,"President-elect Donald Trump is expected to soon appoint a Ukrainian peace envoy to lead negotiations on ending the war with Russia, multiple sources told Fox News Digital.       ""You’re going to see a very senior special envoy, someone with a lot of credibility, who will be given a task to find a resolution, to get to a peace settlement,"" one of the sources said.       ""You’re going to see that in short order.""       The job is not expected to be a salaried role - from 2017 to 2019, Kurt Volker had served as special representative to Ukrainian negotiations on a volunteer basis.       Trump has been rolling out appointee names at lightning pace of those he wants to fill his Cabinet and advise him on top issues.      He picked Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., to serve as his national security advisor and sources have told Fox News he’s settled on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to lead the State Department.       Trump has designated Steven Witkoff to be his special envoy to the Middle East.       Trump has long insisted he could negotiate an end to the war with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Few details have been given about how he would do this.       A report last week by the Wall Street Journal suggested Vice President-elect Vance’s controversial suggestions from the campaign trail are now being pushed by multiple advisers close to the president-elect.      Some advisers are reportedly encouraging Trump to push Kyiv to agree to terms that would freeze the frontlines by creating an 800-mile-long demilitarized zone and allow Russia to keep the land it has illegally seized, which amounts to roughly 20% of Ukraine.      It has also been suggested that Kyiv should agree not to pursue NATO membership for 20 years, a stipulation that critics of this plan argue kowtows to Russian President Vladimir Putin.      A Washington Post report on Sunday also claimed Trump had spoken with Putin, where the president-elect told the Russian leader not to escalate the war.

Trump has another response to Biden's 'garbage' comment about GOP supporters,"Former President Donald Trump has twice responded to President Joe Biden’s ""garbage"" remark made about Trump supporters, with the latest coming just before midnight.      Biden was asked during a Kamala Harris virtual campaign rally on Tuesday about a remark made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during a trump rally Sunday when the comedian called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage.""      The president said, ""The only garbage I see floating out there is [Trump] supporters.""      Based on the 74.2 million votes that Trump received in the 2020 election, according to the Federal Elections Commission, the sitting president called nearly half of the country’s voters ""garbage.""      Trump didn’t hesitate to tweet a response.      ""While I am running a campaign of positive solutions to save America, Kamala Harris is running a campaign of hate,"" Trump wrote. ""Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters ""garbage."" You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown they are both unfit to be President of the United States.      ""I am proud to lead the biggest, broadest, and most important political coalition in American history. We are welcoming historic numbers of Latinos, African Americans, Asian Americans, and citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. It is my desire to be the President of all the people.""      Trump first heard of Biden’s ""garbage"" verbiage while standing on a stage during a rally with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who reportedly alerted Trump of the president’s allegation.      ""Wow. That's terrible,"" Trump said, before recalling Hillary Clinton’s infamous ""deplorable"" remarks just weeks before the 2016 election. ""And then she said irredeemable. That didn't work out.""      ""Garbage, I think, is worse,"" Trump said. ""But he doesn't know. You have to please forgive him.""      Biden’s remark came while Harris had her last major campaign event — which was near the White House.      The White House tried walking back Biden’s statement by releasing this:      ""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,"" Biden tweeted. ""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.""

"‘Liberation Day’: What to expect from President-elect Trump on border security, immigration","When President-elect Trump enters the Oval Office in January 2025, he will likely transform how the United States conducts immigration policy – with a historic deportation operation, a crackdown on foreign gangs, an end to the broad use of parole to allow in migrants, and renewed border wall construction at the top of his agenda.      ""We're going to fix our borders,"" Trump said Wednesday as he declared victory. ""We're going to fix everything about our country, and we've made history for a reason tonight.""      Trump made immigration and ending the crisis at the southern border a central part of his campaign, as he had in his initial 2016 White House bid.      Those calls were fueled in part by a historic crisis at the border that exploded under President Biden’s watch and just months after Trump left office. While the Biden administration blamed a lack of funding and a broken immigration system, Trump and Republican allies pointed instead to the rolling back of Trump-era policies by the administration.      Whatever the cause, millions of migrants flooded into the United States as numbers skyrocketed in 2021 and remained at record highs through 2022 and 2023. Numbers dropped sharply in June after Biden limited entries into the U.S., although migrants have continued to come into the U.S. via a broad use of humanitarian parole.      While numbers are now down at the border, 2024 has seen a series of high-profile crimes by illegal immigrants, some of whom were allowed into the U.S. under the administration.       Trump has made clear his intention to turn the clock, promising during his campaign to end ""every open borders policy of the Biden administration.""      He has promised to continue building the wall at the southern border, over 450 miles of which was built during his first administration. He has also promised to launch the ""largest domestic deportation operation in American history"" to deport millions of illegal immigrants.      ""Following the Eisenhower Model, we will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,"" Trump said.      He has also promised to shift enormous parts of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement, and will invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target cartel members and members of violent gangs like the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua.      He said in Auroro, Colorado, last month that Election Day would be known as ""Liberation Day"" for the U.S. from a foreign occupation.      ""We're being occupied by a criminal force, and we're an occupied state that refuses to let our great law enforcement profession do the job that they so dearly want to do,"" he said in Aurora. ""But to everyone here in Colorado and all across our nation, I make this pledge and vow to you, Nov. 5, 2024, will be Liberation Day in America.""      In terms of actions taken by the Biden administration, a future Trump administration will likely roll back the broad use of humanitarian parole that has seen hundreds of thousands of migrants brought in using the CBP One app – both at the ports of entry and by a controversial travel authorization program for nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela that allowed 30,000 in each month from those countries,      Republicans have also called for a tighter use of Temporary Protected Status, which grants foreign nationals from certain countries protection from deportation and work permits if it is deemed unsafe for them to return.      The incoming administration will likely end the Biden administration’s interior ICE enforcement limits, limit refugee admissions and restore its public charge rule – which limited the ability of immigrants to claim green cards if they are deemed likely to be reliant on welfare.      Other Trump-era policies that could come back include a form of the Remain-in-Mexico policy, which saw migrants stay in Mexico while they wait for their asylum cases to be heard, and travel bans from countries deemed to be national security threats.      In the last week, Trump also raised the possibility of a tariff on Mexican goods to force Mexico to get tighter control of the numbers coming north.      ""I'm going to inform [the Mexican president] on day one or sooner that if they don't stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I'm going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the United States of America,"" he said.      Meanwhile, it is unclear if Trump's election will dissuade migrants from attempting entry into the U.S., or if it might trigger a final surge to attempt entry before he takes office in January.",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/liberation-day-what-expect-from-president-elect-trump-border-security-immigration
What we know about Georgia's 4 million votes already cast ahead of Election Day,"Millions of Americans are heading to the polls Tuesday to cast their Election Day ballots, and in battleground Georgia, more than half the state’s active voters have already done so.      The Peach State’s early voting period between Oct. 15 and Nov. 1 saw more than 4 million people vote either early in-person or absentee. That’s 55.5% of their active voting populace, according to Georgia’s Election Data Hub.      Both the Trump and Harris campaigns are pouring enormous resources into the state won by President Biden in 2020 by less than 1%.      Here is what we know about who has voted in Georgia already:      More women than men   Female early voters in Georgia have outpaced male voters by double digits – something Vice President Kamala Harris’ allies see as a positive sign for Democrats, given their emphasis on abortion rights in the elections since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.      Former President Trump has also made recent appeals to women voters, promising in several events over the last few days to ""protect women"" and warning they are ""under attack"" by illegal immigrants under the current Democratic administration.      In Georgia, 56% of early voters were women, while 43.8% were men.      Black women outpaced Black men   The gap between female and male voters in Georgia widened considerably when focused on Black voters.      Women made up 62.1% of Black voters who voted early in-person or absentee, while Black men trailed behind with 37.8%.      Black voters, women in particular, are still expected to favor Harris and the Democratic Party in broad numbers.      The Trump campaign, however, has worked to make inroads with Black men in key swing states like Georgia and North Carolina, with promises of economic prosperity under Republicans.       White voters made up the largest share   A 58% majority of Georgia’s early voters were White, according to Georgia Votes, a data aggregation site partnered with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.      That was followed by Black voters with 26.4% of the early vote.      Hispanic and Asian voters combined made up roughly 6% of early voters.      Black or African American Georgians make up roughly a third of the state’s population, according to the most recent census data.      Of the state’s active White voters, 63% have already voted, compared to 49.7% of active Black voters, the Georgia elections site says.      High turnout in rural counties   Counties considered more rural in Georgia have seen more of their active voters cast pre-Election Day ballots than more Democratic-leaning areas around Atlanta.      The 20 counties ranked highest in terms of percentage of total active voter turnout so far were all won by Trump in 2020, despite Biden winning the state overall.      The bluer counties in the Atlanta metropolitan area are still significantly larger than those rural counties where turnout is high – but in a race that came down to less than 12,000 votes in 2020, every ballot cast is critical.      Most voters from Democratic strongholds   In terms of sheer numbers, the most early and absentee voters have been in Atlanta and its densely packed surrounding suburbs.      The top three counties in terms of turnout are Towns, Oconee and Dawson – all were won by Trump in 2020, but together the number of active voters who have cast ballots there already is just over 47,000.      By contrast, the counties of Henry, Cobb and Fulton – the third being home to the city of Atlanta itself – have seen less of their total active voting populations turn out before Election Day, but more than 861,000 ballots cast so far.      Over 830,000 didn’t vote in 2020   One of the biggest questions of the Election Day post-mortem will be how more than 830,000 early voters who did not vote at all in 2020 cast their ballots this time around.      That group makes up roughly 21% of Georgia’s early voters, per Georgia Votes. Roughly half of those voters are White and about a quarter are Black.      Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones told Fox News Digital last week that he believes those voters are largely Trump supporters who voted in 2016 but did not do so in 2020.      It’s worth noting, however, that the majority of early voters in Georgia also voted early in 2020.",5-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-we-know-about-georgias-4-million-votes-already-cast-ahead-election-day
Biden-Trump White House meeting revives presidential tradition skipped 4 years ago,"Just over a week after his sweeping election victory, former and future President Trump returns to the White House on Wednesday.      Trump is returning to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., his first time back in nearly four years, at the invitation of the man he knocked out of the 2024 White House race: President Biden.      The two presidents will sit down in the Oval Office around 11 a.m. ET, according to the White House.      Trump is also expected to address House Republicans and their new incoming members on Wednesday, where X owner Elon Musk is also expected to be in attendance, sources told Fox News Digital.      The president-elect is making a pit stop at the hotel where House GOP lawmakers are holding their leadership elections near the U.S. Capitol, just before his planned meeting with Biden.      For Biden, who ended his re-election bid in July a month after his disastrous debate performance against Trump reignited questions over whether the 81-year-old president was physically and mentally up for another four years in the White House and sparked calls for him to drop out of the race, the meeting with his predecessor and now successor may be awkward.      Trump spent years verbally eviscerating Biden and his performance in the White House. And even after Biden ended his re-election bid, Trump continued to slam the president and his successor atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket, Vice President Harris.      And Biden for a couple of years has labeled Trump a threat to the nation's democracy.      But Biden, a traditionalist, wants to ensure a smooth transition between administrations.      ""I assured him that I’d direct my entire administration to work with his team,"" the president said of his call last week with Trump after the election when he made the invitation.       Trump's team, in an apparent change of tone toward Biden, said the president-elect ""looks forward to the meeting.""      Biden's offer to Trump to visit the White House was an invitation he himself was never accorded.      Four years ago, in the wake of his election defeat at the hands of Biden, Trump refused to concede and tried unsuccessfully to overturn the results.      Breaking with longstanding tradition, Trump didn't invite Biden to the White House. And two weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters aiming to upend congressional certification of Biden's Electoral College victory, Trump left Washington ahead of the presidential inauguration of his successor, becoming the first sitting president in more than a century to skip a successor's inauguration.      ""President Biden's decision to welcome President-elect Trump to the White House is a tribute to normalcy in the presidential transition process. What was denied to Joe Biden following his election is being restored to Biden's credit,"" veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance told Fox News.      Lesperance, the president of New Hampshire-based New England College, called the invitation by Biden ""a remarkable gesture in that it legitimizes Trump's return to power by the nation's leading Democrat and, hopefully, will be met with a commitment to orderly transitions in the future.""      The meeting will be the first between Biden and Trump since they faced off in their one and only debate on June 27 in Atlanta. The two presidents, along with Harris and Trump's running mate, now-Vice President-elect Sen. JD Vance, stood next to each other on Sept. 11 in New York City's Lower Manhattan at ceremonies for the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.      This will be Trump's second meeting at the White House with a departing president.      Eight years ago, after defeating Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump sat down at the White House with President Obama, who was finishing up his second term.      ""We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed. Because, if you succeed, then the country succeeds,"" Obama told Trump at the time.      While a tradition, the meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents is not mandated.      A big question mark heading into the meeting: Will the vice president join Biden and Trump for any portion of the gathering?      Harris phoned Trump last week and congratulated him on his victory over her.      As for House Republicans, who are selecting their new leaders behind closed doors on Wednesday, Trump is expected to throw his support behind Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to keep the top job, even despite some rumblings of discontent and threats of a protest against the Louisiana Republican by the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus and their allies.      One of several sources who detailed potential plans by the Freedom Caucus to protest Johnson’s bid for speaker told Fox News Digital that Trump’s endorsement will do little to stop them from trying to block unanimous approval of Johnson’s leadership. However, those protest threats largely fell flat in the House GOP Conference on Tuesday, including among Johnson critics who say Trump’s endorsement will likely seal the deal.      Trump has praised Johnson on multiple occasions and the two men are known to have a good working relationship. He’s speaking to House Republicans after they all but declared victory in the 2024 elections, despite several close races still being undecided.",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-trump-white-house-meeting-revives-presidential-tradition-skipped-four-years-ago
'Act of war': Biden administration under pressure to respond to Iran's plot to kill Trump,"On Friday, U.S. Department of Justice unsealed new charges detailing a thwarted murder-for-hire plot that the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ordered against Donald Trump in the weeks leading up to the election, adding new pressure for the Biden administration to act.      According to a newly unsealed criminal complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, the IRGC ordered an Iranian asset in September to focus on ""surveilling"" and putting together a plan to assassinate Trump before the Nov. 5 elections.       Trump was briefed by U.S intelligence officials in September about threats from Iran to assassinate him, campaign officials confirmed.      Both President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Fox News in October that they considered any Iranian threats against Trump to be a ""top-tier"" national security issue, and said any attempt by the IRGC to actually harm Trump would be met with kinetic military action equal to ""an act of war."" Neither the White House nor the State Department immediately responded to Fox News’s request for comment on the nature of the threat from the IRGC, or how they planned to respond.      The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps., or IRGC, is a military and counterintelligence agency that was designated as a terrorist organization during Trump’s first term.       Trump has been a target of the IRGC since January 2020, when as president he ordered the drone strike that killed the commander of the Iranian Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani.      News of the thwarted attack on Trump comes after he survived two earlier and unrelated assassination attempts earlier this year while campaigning for a second term as president: The first, in July at a Pennsylvania campaign rally, and then in September, while golfing at one of his properties in Florida.   The threats from Iran, detailed in the now-public criminal filings, prompted the Secret Service to beef up their security presence around the Trump campaign in recent months.      It is unclear whether, or how, Trump plans to further clamp down on security at his residences in the months before his inauguration.   U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday that there ""are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran.""      ""We will not stand for the Iranian regime’s attempts to endanger the American people and America’s national security,"" he added.      In the criminal complaint, U.S. prosecutors said an unnamed official in the IRGC had asked the asset, Farhad Shakeri, to ""focus on surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating, former President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.""      The Department of Justice said that Shakeri, who remains at large and is believed to be living in Iran, ""immigrated to the United States as a child and was deported in or about 2008 after serving 14 years in prison for a robbery conviction."" Trump is referred to the filings as ""Victim-4.""   ""According to Shakeri, during his meeting with IRGC Official-I on or about October 7, 2024, IRGC Official-I directed Shakeri to provide a plan within seven days to kill Victim-4. If Shakeri was unable to put forth a plan within that timeframe, IRGC Official-I continued, the IRGC would pause its plan to kill Victim-4 until after the U.S. Presidential elections, because IRGC Official-I assessed that Victim-4 would lose the election and, afterward, it would be easier to assassinate Victim-4,"" the documents said.      Federal prosecutors have also charged and arrested Carlisle Rivera, 49, of Brooklyn, New York, and Jonathon Loadholt, 36, of Staten Island, New York, ""in connection with their alleged involvement"" in a plot to murder a U.S. citizen of Iranian origin in New York.       The Department of Justice declined to respond to comment on the threats or the investigation.

Biden calls Trump supporters 'garbage' during Harris campaign event as VP promises unity at Ellipse rally,"President Biden went viral Tuesday night for comments disparaging Trump supporters as his No. 2, Vice President Kamala Harris, made a major speech to voters calling for unity from the Ellipse right outside the White House.       During a virtual Harris campaign call with Voto Latino, Biden took a swipe at former President Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden, which made headlines after insult comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made jokes mocking different ethnic groups, with one joke referring to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage.""      ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,"" Biden said. ""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it is un-American."" The comment quickly went viral and sparked swift condemnation from critics.       ""This is disgusting,"" Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance reacted. ""Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country. There's no excuse for this. I hope [Americans] reject it.""      ""Kamala Harris was deeply outraged by a comedian’s joke. If she has any decency or integrity, she will condemn her partner Joe Biden’s despicable statement calling half the country garbage,"" Sen Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said.       ""Woof. Calls half the country ‘garbage’ while Harris speaks,"" CNN contributor Scott Jennings said.      ""Well there he is. So outraged by Tony the comedian that the sitting president borrows the garbage characterization to apply it to half of America. I imagine the cable news set will be all over this tomorrow, right?"" Ruthless podcast co-host Josh Holmes wondered.      ""Just amazing that Biden managed to completely step on Kamala's speech in the worst way possible,"" Fox News contributor Joe Concha said.      ""Shades of Hillary’s deplorables… I repeat: Lots of 2016 vibes in this election,"" Jewish Insider editor in chief Josh Kraushaar wrote.      ""If you’re wondering why Biden wasn’t at the rally that Kamala Harris just held in front of his home,"" Business Insider reporter Bryan Metzger quipped.      Trump himself reacted to the ""terrible"" comment while speaking at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania.       ""Remember Hillary? She said ‘deplorable' and then said ‘irredeemable,’ right? But she said ‘deplorable.' That didn't work out. ‘Garbage’ I think is worse,"" Trump said to his supporters. ""But he doesn't know- you have to please forgive him. Please forgive him. For he not knoweth what he said.""        ""And I'm convinced he likes me more than he likes Kamala,"" Trump quipped.       Biden attempted to clarify his comments on social media.      ""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,"" Biden wrote on X. ""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.""      A White House spokesperson had previously told Fox News, ""The President referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage.’"" The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.   Biden's comment comes in stark contrast to the message Harris gave to voters outside the White House in what many have called her final sales pitch to the American people ahead of the election.       ""I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solution to make your life better. I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress. I pledge to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make and to people who disagree with me,"" Harris said at the Ellipse rally. ""Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people w      Biden's comment comes in stark contrast to the message Harris gave to voters outside the White House in what many have called her final sales pitch to the American people ahead of the election.

I pledge to listen to experts, to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make and to people who disagree with me,"" Harris said at the Ellipse rally.

Voter registration probes launched in crucial Keystone State counties amid claims of potential fraud,"Potentially fraudulent election materials are being probed by top law enforcement and election officials in the battleground state of Pennsylvania as the 2024 contest enters its final days.       District attorneys and election officials in both Lancaster County and York County are looking into potential election-related fraud after authorities received large batches of voter registration materials from a ""third-party organization."" Both York and Lancaster counties have more registered Republican voters than Democrats, according to state data, with York Republicans holding a 63% majority in the area and Lancaster Republicans at a 61% majority.      The importance of the issues cropping up in Pennsylvania — which is widely viewed as one of the key battleground states that could determine a winner in the presidential race — were underscored on Tuesday, when 2024 GOP nominee and former President Trump highlighted the allegations of potential fraud in a Truth Social post.       ""Wow! York County, Pennsylvania, received THOUSANDS of potentially FRAUDULENT Voter Registration Forms and Mail-In Ballot Applications from a third party group. This is on top of Lancaster County being caught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person. Really bad ""stuff."" WHAT IS GOING ON IN PENNSYLVANIA??? Law Enforcement must do their job, immediately!!! WOW!!!"" he posted.       In Lancaster County, home to Pennsylvania's Amish community, the district attorney and the Lancaster County Board of Elections held a press conference last week announcing the investigation of potential fraudulent voter registration forms — not ballots as Trump had alleged — after receiving roughly 2,500 voter registration applications in two separate batches last week. The batches of registration applications were dropped off ahead of Pennsylvania's registration deadline on Oct. 21.       ""Staff noticed that numerous applications appeared to have the same handwriting (and) were filled out on the same day,"" District Attorney Heather Adams said during a press conference. ""The confirmed indicators of fraud that detectives came across were inaccuracies with the addresses listed on the applications, fake and false personal identification information, as well as false names. Also, applications that had names that did not match the provided Social Security information.""      Adams said the materials sometimes included correct personal information, but when the individuals were contacted by investigators, they reported they did not request the application forms. She estimated this week that about 60% of the applications were fraudulent, News 8 reported.       County Commissioner Josh Parsons told News 8 that the alleged phony registration forms are a ""threat"" to the election process.       ""We know that this is a threat to our election system,"" Parsons said. ""This is essentially an attack on our election system when you're trying to get registrations in that are clearly fraudulent.""      He added, ""If we have clearly fraudulent applications on their face, that is a problem. That is a threat to our election security. That's what we want our staff to detect. They did. We're glad the system worked in Lancaster County. We're proud of them for doing that.""      Concerns over fraudulent election materials are also mounting in York County, which neighbors Lancaster County across the Susquehanna River. County commissioners are currently looking into suspicious ""election-related materials from a third-party organization.""       ""We are committed to ensuring the integrity, safety and security of our elections. The York County Office of Elections and Voter Registration has received a large delivery containing thousands of election-related materials from a third-party organization,"" York County President Commissioner Julie Wheeler said in a statement provided to local outlets this week.      The statement continued, ""Those materials appear to include completed voter registration forms, as well as mail-in ballot applications. As with all submissions, our staff follows a process for ensuring all voter registrations and mail-in ballot requests are legal. That process is currently underway. If suspected fraud is identified, we will alert the District Attorney’s Office, which will then conduct an investigation. We will have no further comment until our internal review has been completed.""      Wheeler added that an ""overabundance of registrations from one particular organization"" set off alarm bells for election officials, according to Fox 43.       The York County DA's office told Fox News Digital on Wednesday, ""The Office of the District Attorney has been in constant contact with the York County Commissioners and York County Board of Elections regarding any potential irregularities they are seeing and observing that may necessitate further investigation by this office.""      ""As we have always done, this office will investigate any matter regarding elections that require a criminal investigation and if needed, would prosecute any cases where the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction. Regarding any specific allegations or investigation, it is the policy of this office not to comment on such specific matters but only general operating procedures. Any other questions concerning the operations of elections should be referred to the County Commissioners and/or the Board of Elections,"" the DA's office continued.       Eyes are locked on Pennsylvania this election cycle, as the Northeast battleground state could help tip the election one way or the other.      Pennsylvania carries 19 electoral votes and since 1992 has voted for Democratic presidential candidates — until Trump's successful 2016 election. Trump narrowly won the state that year as he campaigned against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In 2020, however, Joe Biden won the state by 1.17 percentage points, teeing up a highly-anticipated election showdown next week between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.",30-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voter-registration-probes-launched-crucial-keystone-state-counties-amid-claims-potential-fraud
Fox News Decision Desk projects GOP takes back Senate majority in devastating blow to Dems,"The Fox News Decision Desk projected that Republicans will take back control of the Senate in 2025 once the 119th Congress is sworn in.      The GOP officially won enough Senate seats in the 2024 elections to take the majority back from the Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has led the upper chamber since 2021.       Republicans had a significantly more favorable map in terms of which Senate seats were up for election this cycle than the Democrats.       The Republicans up for re-election were all in relatively safe states, and the party was all but guaranteed a win in West Virginia to replace outgoing Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va. With a West Virginia win and retaining all incumbents who were up for re-election, the GOP would be at 50 members already.       Democrats were in a much more difficult position, expected to lose Manchin's seat and having to fight a tight battle for outgoing Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's Arizona Senate seat.       At the same time, several incredibly vulnerable Senate Democrats just so happened to be up for re-election this cycle, including Montana's Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, in red-voting states, and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, in presidential battleground states.       If that weren't enough, the seat of outgoing Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., was also at severe risk of going red      Democrats only had a 51-member majority over their Republican counterparts, who had a 49-person conference.       The party could not afford to lose practically any races in the 2024 elections, given their many vulnerabilities.       What made the 2024 elections even more difficult for Democrats to hang onto the majority was the sharp decrease in split-ticket voting. In several states, the races were very likely to be decided by the winner of the presidential race, as voters were expected to pick one party and vote for candidates in that column down the ballot.      When Republicans vote for their new leader this month, they'll also be selecting the next person to control the Senate floor after Schumer. The new GOP leader will succeed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the longest-serving party leader in Senate history.       The newly elected Republican senators will participate in a secret ballot.",5-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-projects-republicans-take-back-senate-majority-devastating-blow-dems
Texas AG sues Biden-Harris admin for not verifying citizenship of 450K 'potentially ineligible' voters,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing the Biden-Harris administration for not providing information that the Republican says he needs to verify the citizenship of 450,000 ""potentially ineligible voters.""       The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, as well as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its director, Ur Jaddou, are named as defendants.       DHS says states wishing to verify citizenship can use the USCIS SAVE program and that it will not provide an ""alternative process to any state.""      The federal lawsuit, filed in the Western District of Texas, claims that the Biden-Harris administration has refused to comply with federal law and answer ""valid requests"" for information from Paxton and Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson ""for the citizenship status of the over 450,000 people on Texas’s voter rolls for whom the State cannot verify their citizenship status using existing sources.""       Paxton says those over 450,000 people did not use a Texas-issued driver's license or ID card to register to vote in the state, so ""those voters never had their citizenship verified.""      Nelson wrote to Jaddou on Sept. 18 saying the Texas Secretary of State's office compiled a list of individuals on Texas’ voter rolls whose citizenship could not be verified and asked for assistance in doing so.       Paxton penned a similar letter to the USCIS director on Oct. 7, stating, ""Although I have no doubt the vast majority of the voters on the list are citizens who are eligible to vote, I am equally certain that Texans have no way of knowing whether or not any of the voters on the list are noncitizens who are ineligible to vote.""      In a letter to Nelson on Oct. 10, Jaddou responded, saying that the ""Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program is the most secure and efficient way to reliably verify an individual’s citizenship or immigration status, including for verification regarding voter registration and/or voter list maintenance,"" and maintained that USCIS ""currently cannot offer an alternative process to any state.""      ""Since 2009, SAVE has been used by elections authorities in states for voter registration and/or voter list maintenance. Currently, ten states are registered to use SAVE for these purposes,"" he wrote. ""The process has been the same since the program’s inception.""       ""By inputting an individual’s name, unique DHS-issued immigration identifier, and birthdate, registered agencies can determine whether that person obtained U.S. citizenship through the naturalization process or, for certain other individuals born abroad, whether USCIS has information confirming their U.S. citizenship. Each registered agency determines the best process to obtain the required identifiers,"" Jaddou explained. ""The state elections authority must provide any individual who is not verified as a U.S. citizen through SAVE the opportunity to show documentation of their U.S. citizenship.""      Paxton's lawsuit states that ""pointing to the SAVE system"" does not fulfill the Texas secretary of state's request and Jaddou's response does not satisfy USCIS’ ""unambiguous obligations under federal law.""       It also says that Jaddou has not responded to Paxton's letter.       According to Paxton, the SAVE program, designed to confirm a person’s lawful presence in the United States, ""is not an adequate tool, on its own, for a state seeking to verify the citizenship status of an individual on the voter rolls."" That's because it requires the use of a ""unique DHS-issued immigration identifier,"" which the lawsuit says is ""information that is not maintained by, or readily available to, the Secretary of State of Texas or Texas’s voter registrars.""       Texas’s statewide voter registration system ""does not contain any ""DHS-issued immigration identifier[s],"" the lawsuit says, so even if the Texas secretary of state ""could obtain this data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, that effort would be limited to individuals who provided such information to obtain a driver license or personal identification card — and thus would not encompass individuals for whom there is no Texas-issued driver license or ID card number in Texas’s voter registration system.""       The filing also noted that USCIS charges users a fee for each verification submitted to the SAVE system — fees that the state is willing to pay but ""will more than double over the next three years.""       ""Although federal and state law prohibit non-citizens from voting, federal law paradoxically creates opportunities for non-citizens to illegally register to vote while prohibiting States from requiring voters to have proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections — a common sense measure to identify illegal registration,"" the suit says. ""Under any circumstances, this federal prohibition against citizenship verification makes little sense, but it is especially troubling given the current scale of the illegal immigration crisis.""       The filing also cited how the Senate has not passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (""SAVE Act""), ""which would allow states to ensure that votes are being cast legally by eligible voters.""       Asked about Paxton's lawsuit, a DHS spokesperson again pointed to the SAVE program.       ""DHS does not comment on pending litigation,"" the spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""More broadly, USCIS has engaged with Texas and will continue to correspond with them directly through official channels.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) administers an online information service called SAVE that allows registered and authorized agencies, including election authorities in states, to verify certain individuals’ citizenship or immigration status.""        Scores of election-related lawsuits happen in every cycle, and Florida filed a similar lawsuit citing how the SAVE program's DHS identifier requirement is a roadblock in verifying citizenship of those on the voter roll.      While Texas could see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz locked in a close race against Democratic challenger Rep. Colin Allred, the Lone Star State is unlikely to go blue in the presidential contest.

Discovery of 'fraudulent' voter applications prompts PA probe of Arizona company's potential involvement,"A Pennsylvania prosecutor is investigating roughly 30 voter registration applications and mail-in ballot applications that were identified as ""fraudulent"" — including several that officials linked to an Arizona-based group that is working in the county.The registration forms were spotted by the county’s board of elections officials, who then separated the forms and referred the matter for further investigation, Monroe County District Attorney Mike Mancuso said in a statement.At least some of the forms were submitted by ""Field and Media Corps,"" an apparent subsidiary of Fieldcorp, an Arizona-based organization working in Lancaster County, according to Mancuso.""The broader investigation continues with reference to Fieldcorp’s involvement,"" he said. Mancuso urged residents to remain calm, noting that his office ""is in regular contact and working with investigators from the Attorney General’s Office as well as others.""""A further update will be made in the next day or so,"" he said.Monroe County did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.The news comes after election officials in Lancaster County reported receiving two separate batches of apparently fraudulent or incomplete voter registration forms earlier this month. The 2,500 forms marked as suspicious either had false names, duplicative handwriting or unverifiable or incorrect identifying information, officials said. The issues prompted county election officials to notify both the Pennsylvania Department of State and the state attorney general’s office to open a criminal investigation. The applications reportedly were not limited to a single party, and were collected in various spots across the county.Pennsylvania Attorney General Michelle Henry sought to reassure voters in the Keystone State, noting in a press release late Thursday that her office has been working with respective counties on the apparent attempts to submit fraudulent ballots and investigate any organizations that may be responsible. ""While we will not be divulging sensitive information about these investigations, we want to clarify that the investigations regard voter registration forms, not ballots,"" Henry said. ""These attempts have been thwarted by the safeguards in place in Pennsylvania. We are working every day with our partners to ensure a fair, free, and safe election.""She added: ""The investigations are ongoing, and offenders who perpetrated acts of fraud will be held accountable under the law.""",1-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/discovery-fraudulent-voter-applications-prompts-pa-probe-arizona-companys-potential-involvement
Republicans cut into Dem voter registration advantage in crucial swing state as early vote wraps up,"New numbers released in a key swing state show that Republicans have virtually erased the Democrat voter-registration lead, on top of historic early-voting numbers for Republicans, which one expert tells Fox News Digital is part of an effective strategy on the ground targeting a key demographic.Figures released by the Nevada Secretary of State on Friday showed that Democrats hold a 9,200-vote lead in registrations over Republicans after October data was added. Four years ago, Democrats held an advantage of roughly 86,000 votes heading into Election Day.On top of significantly narrowing the registration gap, Republicans have had a historically high early-vote turnout and lead Democrats by about 5% in the early vote, which ended in person on Friday, while trailing in mail-in votes.Early voting concluded in Nevada with 393,811 votes cast for Republicans, 344,539 for Democrats, and 287,762 for other affiliations, according to the Secretary of State website.The roughly 49,000 vote advantage that Republicans had over Democrats at the end of the week is a stark contrast from 2020, when Democrats ended early voting with a 43,000-vote advantage.Biden won Nevada by roughly 34,000 votes in 2020.The Democratic turnout advantage in the state in years past has been driven by what is known as the ""Reid Machine"" that late Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, the U.S. Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015, established to help pool resources to maximize support for candidates up and down the ballot. His approach tapped into networks that extended well beyond the traditional party structure. He leaned especially on the heavily immigrant Culinary Union, which represents about 60,000 casino workers and leads efforts to register voters, make phone calls and knock on doors.""That paradigm has changed,"" Nevada’s GOP Gov. Joe Lombardo said in Carson City on Friday. ""That dynamic has changed. It has changed, and we are in the game. We are in the game, and it helps that you had a crappy president for the last four years.""A large part of that paradigm shift, Sentinel Action Fund President Jessica Anderson told Fox News Digital, has to do with the work that organizations like hers have done in battleground states along with the Republican Party.""You had candidates up and down the ballots, including President Trump and Senate candidates in all of the target states, embracing early voting,"" Anderson said. ""The candidate has to be brought in themselves. So that's really important. And then the other three things I think that made a difference was the messaging around absentee early votes. The first is that a lot of the focus was on convenience. It's, you know, it's more convenient. You're busy. You can skip the line of Election Day, vote early. You know, you're busy with your kids, your child care, your job. You know, whatever those things are that can potentially interrupt your plans on Election Day, just take the convenience of voting early or dropping your ballot in the mail and get a difference. I think that message really worked.""""The second message that we saw really encapsulated and worked in particular in the mail was the military messaging. That it works for our guys overseas, it's safe, it's convenient, it's secure. Then the third, which was, I think, really unique to President Trump and his leadership here as we talked about voting early to overcome the margin of fraud and that did exceptionally well in our focus groups. And then when we presented some of that information to President Trump and to others in the party over time, that became kind of the clarion call of the RNC, you know, ‘Vote early.’ So it's too big to rig.""Anderson said that Sentinel Action Fund has also embraced ballot harvesting and that one of the keys to Republican success has been the strategic targeting of low-propensity voters who have not voted in years past.Some experts have wondered whether strong GOP early-vote turnout in Nevada, and nationwide, would ""cannibalize"" the historically strong Election Day turnout that Republicans usually enjoy in a situation where Election Day voters are simply just voting early, and Republicans will have a weaker turnout on Election Day. Anderson told Fox News Digital that Sentinel Action Fund’s data and modeling in Senate races in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Nevada show that the GOP vote is not being cannibalized.""I know it's not happening, because we can see it in the data,"" Anderson said, pointing to Sentinel Action Fund modeling in the Senate race between GOP Senate candidate Sam Brown and incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen.""Democrats and Republicans appear to be getting ballots from the same percentage of high- and low-propensity voters, but Democrat Jacky Rosen’s votes are coming disproportionately through the mail,"" Anderson wrote on Substack on Friday.""Meanwhile, Sam Brown is winning in-person ballots at a ratio of 1.35 to 1. If the Reid machine is unable to match Republicans during early voting, it’s hard to see it mobilizing for an Election Day surge. There is good reason to believe that Sam Brown can continue to perform well through Election Day.""Some political pundits and politicians outside the Republican Party have also sounded the alarm for Democrats in Nevada in terms of the GOP early-vote surge.""Republicans are kicking our ass at early voting,"" Nevada Democratic Congresswoman Dina Titus said during a Harris rally in North Las Vegas. ""We cannot let that happen.""Respected Nevada journalist Jon Ralston, CEO and Editor of the Nevada Independent, acknowledged on X on Friday that ""you'd rather be GOP than Dems as in-person early voting ends today"" but pointed out that three remaining variables are ""key,"" including Clark County mail figures, the independent vote and Election Day turnout.On Saturday, Ralston posted on X, ""NV voter update: GOP extends lead to 49 K statewide.

GOP lawmakers sound alarm on military voting 'deficiencies' ahead of Election Day,"With just four days to go until Election Day, Republican lawmakers are demanding answers from the Pentagon after receiving complaints about inadequate resources to help military service members vote. Active duty service members claim the Pentagon has not allocated enough resources to let them cast their ballot on time and that the stockpile of write-in absentee ballots on at least one military base is depleted and has not been replenished, according to three GOP congressmen. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich. and Mike Waltz, R-Fla., penned a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Wednesday, writing ""with grave concern"" about ""deficiencies in the Defense Department’s protocols,"" which also includes not making service members aware of their options on how to vote.""Our nation’s brave men and women in uniform brought to our attention that there has been inadequate education at the administrative level on how to register to vote, request an absentee ballot, and fill in a federal write-in absentee ballot if their state-issued ballot does not arrive in time,"" the lawmakers write.""Other service members also stated that when a request for a federal write-in absentee ballot was made, they were told the base’s stockpile of such ballots was depleted and had not been replenished.""The lawmakers say it is imperative that the Pentagon does everything in its power so the nation’s ""elite warriors"" have every opportunity to vote and that the Department of Defense (DOD) ""mobilize all the necessary resources over the next seven days"" so that military personnel are given that opportunity.They also requested that Austin clarify what training or guidance is given to service members so that they can vote and what training is given to each unit’s Voting Assistance Office (VAO).The Republicans also asked if there is a sufficient stockpile of federal write-in absentee ballots for service members nationwide to vote if their state-issued absentee ballot does not arrive on time. Additionally, the lawmakers want to know if military personnel have been given sufficient time to review a sample ballot electronically, so they know their voting options ahead of the election or if they have to fill in a federal write-in absentee ballot.Fox News Digital requested comment from the DOD regarding the letter but did not receive a response prior to publication.""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have mobilized federal manpower, resources, and tax dollars to block state-level election integrity measures, including in Georgia and Virginia, through lawsuits and smears,"" Mast, a miliary veteran who lost both his legs while serving in Afghanistan in 2010, tells Fox News Digital.""They claim to care about democracy and the right to vote, yet they’ve failed to plan accordingly to facilitate the right to vote for every single one of our nation’s brave men and women in uniform. This is absolutely unacceptable. Our nation’s elite warriors deserve to have every opportunity to vote for the next commander-in-chief, especially since that person will be making life-and-death decisions for our troops.""Waltz, who served 27 years in the U.S. Army and National Guard, echoed those sentiments. ""Both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have dismissed our warfighters serving in combat zones by either falsely claiming the U.S. has suffered no casualties under this administration or by claiming thousands of these service members aren’t in active combat zones,"" Waltz tells Fox News Digital. ""We need assurances these service members who are putting their lives on the line for our country have the information and tools they need to cast their ballot to vote."" Huizenga too said the situation ""is completely unacceptable.""""Sadly, this is the latest example of the Biden-Harris Administration failing to stand up for our servicemembers,"" Huizenga tells Fox News Digital.A Defense official told Fox News Digital stocks of voting materials and supplies at military installations are based on local need and demand. The official said service members seeking further information or printable copies of a Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot can visit FVAP.gov to access those materials.In the 2024 election cycle, the Defense Department's Federal Voting Assistance Program has trained more than 3,000 Voting Assistance Officers to educate military voters and ensure they exercise their right to vote. ""In addition to designating Voting Assistance Officers, every installation commander ensures voting assistance is included in the administrative in-processing as well as pre- and post- deployment checklists required of reporting and detaching personnel,"" the official said.Voting procedures for military personnel are governed by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, which requires that service members are regularly notified of upcoming elections and that their absentee ballots receive expedited mail delivery service to be counted in federal elections.

Chinese citizen charged after allegedly voting illegally in key battleground state; vote will be counted,"A Chinese citizen, who attends the University of Michigan, was charged for allegedly voting illegally in the key battleground state of Michigan – and that student's vote will still be counted.A spokesperson for the Michigan Secretary of State confirmed to Fox News Digital that the Chinese citizen voted at a polling place at the University of Michigan Museum of Art on Sunday, Oct. 27.The state's top authorities condemned the 19-year-old's actions, saying that since the man is not a U.S. citizen, he cannot vote in federal elections.""Only U.S. citizens can register and vote in our elections. It is illegal to lie on any registration forms or voting applications about one’s citizenship status. Doing so is a felony,"" Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit wrote in a joint statement.Despite the fact that the Chinese citizen's ballot was cast illegally, it is expected to be counted in the upcoming election.Andrew McCarthy, a Fox News contributor and a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, told Fox News Digital that it is expected to count because there is no way for election officials to retrieve it once it's been put through a tabulator.""The thing is, because of the imperative of voter secrecy, the ballot does not have an identifying PIN number or other kind of identifying information that would enable somebody afterward to figure out who voted for whom,"" he said. ""That's our dedication to the secret ballot.""""But what it means is if the person passes the identification and qualification aspect of the early voting and gets to fill out the ballot, the ballot then goes into a tabulator, and it gets counted because there's no way to go back and retrieve it and say, 'this is the ballot that shouldn't have been voted.' And that's the problem here.""McCarthy said that the hope is that there is ""enough election security that this will happen few enough times that it won't affect the integrity of the results.""""But the other important thing, and I don't think there's enough of this, is it's a violation of both state law and federal law for an alien to attest that he is an American citizen for purposes of being allowed to register to vote,"" he said. ""And then federally, at least, it's a crime for a non-American to vote, at least if it's done knowingly.""""You've got to bring these cases because people have to be aware that there's a price to be paid if you vote illegally,"" he said. ""And if you don't bring those cases, then you're not really being serious about election integrity.""The Chinese citizen, whose identity was not released, was charged with perjury after making a false statement for the purpose of securing a voter registration and with being an unauthorized elector who attempted to vote.According to Michigan law, the unauthorized elector charge is a felony that is punishable by up to four years with a fine of up to $2,000.Democrat Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement that her office has launched an ""independent, parallel investigation"" into the situation.McCarthy highlighted why he believes voting in-person on Election Day is best – and the most secure option.""I think the safest way to vote and, frankly, the best way to vote, is on Election Day because it means that we're all voting with the same information,"" he said. ""When you have people voting six weeks before the election, we're not even voting with the same information because a lot of important things happen in the run-up to the election.""""But more importantly, for the purposes that we're talking about, there was always a presumption in the law that said, for security purposes, we prefer that you come into the precinct on Election Day and vote. That's how we can secure it the best,"" he said. ""What I think is terrible is we've not only gotten away from the idea that everybody should vote at the polls, but we're now taking the next step. If you vote remotely, and you make an error, that, you know, progressive Democrats decide it's trivial, even though it involves a procedure that's in place precisely to protect the integrity of elections, we should forgive that, or it should be the government's fault that you made the mistake.""""And I think that the position people ought to be taking, because this was always the position that was in our law, is come in and vote on Election Day. But if you don't want to vote on Election Day and you want to take advantage of these other means of voting, fine. But every jot and tittle of the rules is for you to comply with.""Fox News Digital has reached out to the University of Michigan, the Michigan Attorney General's office and the Department of Justice for comment.",30-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chinese-citizen-charged-after-allegedly-voting-illegally-key-battleground-state-vote-counted
Harris-Trump showdown: Vice president keeps her distance from Biden in final stretch,"President Biden returns to the campaign trail this weekend with stops in the biggest of the battleground states, his native Pennsylvania.The White House confirmed the president will campaign on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris and down-ballot Democrats when he makes stops Friday in Philadelphia and Saturday in Scranton, where the 81-year-old Biden was born and spent his early childhood years.But Harris, who with four days until Election Day remains locked in a tight showdown with former President Trump in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, won't be joining her boss on the campaign trail.The vice president has kept her distance from Biden, who, according to polls, remains deeply unpopular with Americans, and her campaign quietly views him as a liability. And that was before the president made two glaring remarks the past two weeks that quickly went viral.While Harris has noted the policy successes of the Biden/Harris administration the past four years while campaigning, she's emphasized that she'll be an agent of change in the White House.Giving her closing address Tuesday night at the Ellipse, just yards from the White House, where the president was huddled, Harris emphasized, ""I have been honored to serve as Joe Biden’s vice president, but I will bring my own experiences and ideas to the Oval Office.""It's been nearly two months since the one-time running mates teamed up on the campaign trail. You have to go back to Labor Day, when they joined forces at a union event in Pittsburgh.The 81-year-old Biden was replaced by Harris atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in July after ending his own bid amid a rising chorus of calls for him to drop out following a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Biden told reporters two months ago he would be ""on the road from there on"" campaigning on behalf of his vice president.It hasn't happened.And while former Democratic presidents Obama and Clinton have crisscrossed the campaign trail in recent weeks on behalf of Harris, Biden's efforts have been more limited and less publicized.While Biden hasn't done many campaign events, he has made official trips with political overtones into some of the seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided his victory over Trump in 2020 and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election.The president has showcased the administration's accomplishments at those events.""I think they are using him in a targeted way that makes sense,"" a political adviser in the president's orbit told Fox News.Last week, Biden teamed up with progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at a policy event in swing state New Hampshire to spotlight their efforts to lower health care costs.The two octogenarians trumpeted a new report by the Department of Health and Human Services that found nearly 1.5 million Medicare enrollees saved almost $1 billion on prescription drugs during the first half of the year.But at a political event minutes later, Biden stirred controversy.Speaking to supporters at the New Hampshire Democratic Party headquarters in Concord, N.H., Biden said of Trump, ""We got to lock him up.""While the president instantly corrected himself, adding ""politically lock him up,"" the damage was done.The initial comment gave Trump instant ammunition for his argument that the four indictments against him — and one conviction — are part of an elaborate Democratic Party witch hunt. That's despite no evidence the president or his administration has played any role in Trump's prosecutions and despite Trump's repeated calls over the years to lock up his own political opponents.Biden dug an even deeper hole Tuesday night, stepping all over the vice president's closing address with more controversial comments during a video call with Latino supporters.Denouncing racist comments made by a comedian at Sunday's Trump rally in New York City that had dominated news coverage for a couple of days, Biden appeared to call supporters of the former president ""garbage.""Biden tried to clean up the mess, saying he was referring to the ""hateful rhetoric"" from the Trump rally comedian and not to the former president's supporters in general.But the Trump campaign and allies immediately pounced, and Biden's comments dominated the news cycle two straight days.Harris on Wednesday morning disavowed any idea of disparaging Trump supporters.She noted that Biden had ""clarified his comments,"" adding, ""Let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.""Even before the Biden remarks, Harris was walking the tight rope that previous vice presidents running for the top job have faced, trying to balance support for the boss and advertising the administration's achievements while also spotlighting a forward-looking message and showing how they'd be different.""This election is about Kamala Harris, so people need to see the vision that she has for America. … It's important that the focus stay on her,"" veteran New Hampshire-based Democratic strategist and Harris convention delegate Jim Demers told Fox News.But Demers, who has also been a longtime Biden supporter and surrogate, noted that ""you're not going to hold Joe Biden back from being on the campaign, and, in the final days, it's good to see him out there urging people to vote for Kamala Harris.""",1-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-showdown-vice-president-keeps-her-distance-from-biden-final-stretch
"Former Harris staffer calls on Biden to resign, install Harris as first female president","Former communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris, Jamal Simmons, surprised a CNN panel Sunday by suggesting President Biden step down to allow Harris to serve as the first female president.""Joe Biden’s been a phenomenal president, he’s lived up to so many of the promises he’s made. There’s one promise left that he could fulfill, being a transitional figure,"" Simmons said on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" ""He could resign the presidency in the next 30 days, make Kamala Harris President of the United States—""The panel, including host Dana Bash, reacted audibly to the idea.He continued, ""It would absolve her from having to oversee the January 6th transition of her own defeat. And it would make sure, it would dominate the news, at a point where Democrats have to learn, drama and transparency and doing things the public want to see. This is the moment for us to change the entire perspective of how Democrats operate.""""This has now jumped from an internet meme to a Sunday morning show,"" Bash responded.Fellow panel member and CNN commentator Scott Jennings remarked, ""Jamal’s out here writing a season of ‘House of Cards.’""When Bash asked Simmons about Harris’ chances of being nominated to the Supreme Court, he reiterated his call for Harris as president.""This is something within Joe Biden‘s control. If he did it, it would, again, fulfill his last promise and give Kamala Harris a chance to be the 47th President of the United States of America. It would disrupt all of Donald Trump‘s paraphernalia, right? He‘d have to rebrand everything. And make it easier for the next woman president not have to hold all that weight of being the first,"" Simmons said.Simmons also floated the idea on his X account.""Joe Biden has been amazing but he should fulfill one last promise - to be transitional. Biden should resign and make Kamala Harris the first woman president. It’d turn tables on Trump, keep Kamala from presiding over Jan 6 make it easier for next woman to run,"" Simmons wrote. ""Dems have better policies but we must realize the old rules no longer apply. We are not playing table tennis. We are in a mixed martial arts fight and Americans respond to drama and excitement. We should use that to make our arguments for a better path forward.""Simmons’ comments came a few days after a CNN commentator suggested Justice Sonia Sotomayor step down for Biden to replace her with Harris before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",10-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-harris-staffer-calls-biden-resign-install-harris-first-female-president
"Mike Rogers in consideration for FBI chief after meeting in Mar-a-Lago with Trump transition team, sources say","Will the second time be the charm for one-time Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent and former Rep. Mike Rogers?Rogers, the 2024 Republican Senate nominee in Michigan who lost his election last week by a razor-thin margin, met Thursday with President-elect Trump's transition team regarding potentially serving as FBI director in the former and future president's second administration, sources familiar tell Fox News.The meeting took place at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.Rogers, who worked as a special agent with the FBI in its Chicago office and served as chair of the House Intelligence Committee during the final four years of his decade-long tenure in Congress, was interviewed in 2017 during Trump's first administration to serve as FBI director after James Comey was dismissed.But Trump at the time decided to appoint Christopher Wray to the traditional 10-year term steering the federal law enforcement agency.Trump, throughout his 2024 White House bid, campaigned in part on cleaning house at the FBI and has repeatedly claimed — without providing proof — that the bureau is chocked full of politically motivated and corrupt executives. And while not as much as others, Wray at times has been a target of Trump's criticism.""Mike Rogers would make a ton of sense as FBI Director for President Trump. Mike's years of service for the bureau as well as his time as House Intelligence Chairman make him highly qualified for the position, one that I'm sure he would be honored to serve in under this administration and help bring integrity back to the DOJ [Department of Justice],"" a source familiar told Fox News.Rogers, a well known face on the cable news networks, in 2022 and early 2023 mulled a run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and made multiple stops in crucial early nominating states, like New Hampshire and Iowa, before deciding against a White House run.He launched his 2024 Senate run in battleground Michigan in September of last year and early this year landed Trump's endorsement. Rogers was narrowly defeated last week by Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin in the race to succeed retiring longtime Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow.Another name that has been floated in media reports to potentially serve as FBI director in the second Trump administration is Kash Patel, the controversial aide and adviser who served roles at the National Security Council and Defense Department during the final two years of Trump's first administration.",15-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mike-rogers-consideration-fbi-chief-after-meeting-mar-a-lago-trump-transition-team-sources-say
Hunter Biden Republican senator says Trump should not pardon Hunter Biden,"Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., says President-elect Trump should not offer Hunter Biden a pardon after he pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in September. ""I don't think he should pardon Hunter,"" Johnson said in an interview on NewsNation's ""Dan Abrams Live.""""I think we need to be very careful about having a dual system of justice where the powerful, or the sons and daughters of the powerful, get off scot-free,"" he said.Johnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, have spearheaded the Senate GOP's investigations into President Biden's son and allegations of corruption surrounding the Biden family. He has often criticized the Biden administration's Justice Department for purportedly treating Hunter's alleged crimes with kid gloves, all the while calling the various criminal investigations into Trump politically motivated.While Johnson is opposed to letting Biden off the hook, he did suggest that Trump might commute or otherwise reduce the first son's sentence as a show of good will and effort to unify the country.""I could see possibly commuting the sentence, reducing it, and it wouldn’t surprise me if President Trump would do that,"" he said. ""I would not pardon Hunter. I would certainly not. I wouldn’t scream about commuting his sentence or reducing it in some way, shape or form.""Hunter was indicted on three felonies and six misdemeanor counts alleging he evaded paying at least $1.4 million in taxes while simultaneously spending money on ""drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes,"" according to the December 2023 indictment.Prosecutors also allege the tax returns Hunter ultimately did file falsely claimed that things like prostitutes, strip club visits, porn website subscriptions and other personal expenses were actually deductible business expenses.The aim, according to the indictment, was to ""evade assessment of taxes to reduce the substantial tax liabilities"" that Hunter faced.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has been repeatedly asked whether President Biden might pardon his son before leaving office. Asked again on Thursday, Jean-Pierre said the president still had no intention of doing so.""We’ve been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no,"" she said.Trump himself floated the idea of a pardon or commuted sentence for Biden in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt in October.""Will you pardon Hunter Biden?"" Hewitt asked the former and future president on Oct. 24. ""I wouldn't take it off the books,"" Trump replied. ""See, unlike Joe Biden, despite what they’ve done to me, where they’ve gone after me so viciously, despite what, and Hunter’s a bad boy. There’s no question about it. He’s been a bad boy. All you had to do is see the laptop from hell. But I happen to think it’s very bad for our country.""

"The fatal flaw in Kamala Harris’ speech, marred by Biden’s ‘garbage’ comment","The optics were perfect. The crowd was massive. The media reviews were glowing.But there was a fundamental contradiction at the heart of Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech on the Ellipse that virtually no one is talking about. First, I’ll give the vice president her due. It was a well-written address and strongly delivered. It contained a fair amount of policy, such as Medicare payments for home health care and aid to first-time home buyers.Harris acknowledged that many voters were just getting to know her. She mentioned her mom and her middle-class upbringing, as she always does. She said she’s not perfect and makes mistakes.But the backbone of the speech was a two-fisted, no-holds-barred attack on former President Donald Trump.Harris likened him to King George III as a ""petty tyrant."" She called him ""unstable"" and ""consumed with grievance."" She said he’s seeking ""unchecked power"" and is ""obsessed with revenge.""In short, after a 100-day campaign, Harris is still running as she did when she quickly seized the nomination, as the anti-Trump.Now, such rhetorical assaults can be traced to the dawn of the republic. You may not love me, but that other guy is so much worse.That’s why she used the White House as a backdrop, standing at the spot where Trump gave his speech on Jan. 6, 2021 urging his supporters to go to the Capitol, where many proceeded to riot.Fine. Fair game. Especially for a candidate who’s trying to win some Republican votes, aided by Liz Cheney, a number of former Trump officials and, as of yesterday, Arnold Schwarzenegger.But then the veep tried to make the pivot, presenting herself as the candidate of unity.And therein lies the fatal flaw. You can’t beat the crap out of your opponent and, in practically the next breath, say you want to bring the country together. You can’t have it both ways. You can be an attack dog, but if you’re baring those teeth, you can’t suddenly be purring like a puppy.Not that Harris didn’t have some good lines. Trump has an enemies list and she’ll have a to-do list. And of political opponents: ""He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at my table.""The segue: ""It is time to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms.""But, um, she just spent a good chunk of her speech pointing fingers.And then she kept circling back to Trump in the second half, such as when discussing abortion rights.Harris also went beyond political exaggeration. ""He tried to cut Medicare and Social Security every year he was president,"" she said. That is simply not true. But she gets very little fact-checking.Overall, the speech was a plus for her, despite its clashing ideas. But make no mistake, she’s running as the alternative to a man she paints as dangerous.As the Free Press put it: ""This campaign is and always has been all about Trump. And it will be all about Trump all the way to the finish line now.""But Harris’ big moment was marred by President Biden – the, ah, previous nominee – to the point where it almost seems like he’s trying to undermine her.Last week, the president said of his predecessor, ""Lock him up."" Harris always says she’ll leave that to the courts.And now, referring to the racist comic at the Madison Square Garden rally who called Puerto Rico an island of garbage, Biden said: ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.""The president stumbled for a couple of seconds and added: ""His–his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.""Boom. Too late. There were instant comparisons to Hillary Clinton’s ""basket of deplorables"" swipe at Trump supporters in 2016.Biden posted a clarification, saying he was referring only to comic Tony Hinchcliffe. (Trump says he doesn’t know the performer and didn’t hear the so-called joke.) The White House put out a transcript that included an apostrophe, as in ""his supporter’s,"" trying to indicate that he was talking about one person. Who would have thought the campaign would turn on a lowly apostrophe?""He clarified his comments, but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for…I believe the work that I do is about representing people whether they support me or not.""Harris finally broke with the boss, wisely distancing herself from the blunder. No wonder she’s resisted his suggestion that they campaign together. He’s doing enough damage on his own, with some pundits even suggesting it’s deliberate. And that gave Trump an opening: ""Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters ‘garbage.’ You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American people.""It’s a distraction that Kamala Harris didn’t need in the final days of the campaign.",31-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fatal-flaw-kamala-harris-speech-marred-bidens-garbage-comment
"Harris holds narrow lead over Trump in 'blue wall' states Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin: poll","A slew of new polls show Vice President Kamala Harris taking a narrow lead over former President Trump in the ""blue wall"" states many forecasters say she needs to win to clinch the presidency. Marist polls of battlegrounds Michigan and Pennsylvania released on Friday have the Democratic vice president ahead of her Republican rival by 2 points in each state, 50% to 48%. A third poll of Wisconsin voters shows Harris with a 3 percentage point lead, 51%-48%. All these results are within the Marist polls' margins of error, plus or minus 3.4 points for the Michigan and Pennsylvania polls and plus or minus 3.5 points for the Wisconsin survey. The surveys were conducted Oct. 27-30.The numbers point toward another historically close election next Tuesday following the 2020 cycle, when just 44,000 votes spread across key battleground states handed President Biden the Electoral College votes he needed to unseat Trump. Similarly, in 2016, Trump captured the White House by just under 78,000 votes in the three ""blue wall"" states. The small leads Harris holds are credited to independent voters, who appear to be moving in her direction in the final days of the election. Harris opened up a 6-point lead over Trump among independents in Michigan, 52%-46%, improving from a 2-point lead in September. She also improved from a 4-point edge with Wisconsin independents in early September to a 6-point lead at the end of October.However, the most dramatic swing comes in Pennsylvania, where Marist finds a 19-point shift among independents, with Harris at 55% and Trump at 40% compared to September, when Trump led Harris among independents 49%-45%.""The Keystone State is the biggest prize of the three highly competitive so-called Blue Wall states,"" said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ""The good news for Harris is she is running stronger among independents and White voters than Biden did four years ago. The bad news is the gender gap is not as wide here as it was in 2020 or, in fact, where it is elsewhere now.""More surveys released Friday show a tight race.A new USA Today/Suffolk poll finds Harris and Trump tied in Pennsylvania with 49% of the vote each, according to a statewide poll of 500 likely voters conducted Oct. 27-30, with a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, called the race a ""toss-up."" ""We have all the results within the margin of error… it’s basically a statistical tie,"" Paleologos said, according to USA Today.Additionally, the final Detroit Free Press poll of likely Michigan voters shows Harris with a 3-percentage-point lead over Trump, strengthened by support from women and Black voters, although the margin is still within the poll's plus or minus 4-point margin of error. The Rust Belt states that comprise the Democratic Party's ""blue wall"" collectively are worth 44 Electoral College votes. Pennsylvania is the largest prize with 19 votes, Michigan has 15 and Wisconsin holds 10. If Harris can win Pennsylvania and one other ""blue wall"" state, Trump would need to sweep the other swing states, which include the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, to win the White House.

""Our Stenography Office transcript — released to our distro, which includes the National Archives — is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.""Director of White House Stenography Amy Sands also reprimanded the White House press office after the debacle, writing in an email, ""After last night's process, our team would like to reiterate that rush drafts/excerpts the Stenography Office sends to assist the Press Office are not intended for public distribution or as the final version of the transcript.""Please avoid sharing rush drafts/excerpts, which are subject to review and might create confusion among staff, media, and the public while our Stenography Office completes a thorough review process.""When contacted by Fox News Digital, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said, ""The President confirmed in his tweet on Tuesday evening that he was addressing the hateful rhetoric from the comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally. That was reflected in the transcript.""However, what remains unclear is whether the transcript the White House cites is the one that was altered and released to the press or the final transcript that was sent to the National Archives.The transcript dispute stems from a virtual Harris campaign call Biden participated in on Tuesday with Voto Latino where he took a swipe at former President Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden, which made headlines after insult comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made a joke referring to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage.""""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,"" Biden said. ""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it is un-American.""The transcript submitted by White House stenographers originally wrote the word as ""supporters."" However, the transcript released by the White House press office had it read ""supporter's"" with an apostrophe instead, implying Biden was criticizing Hinchcliffe and not all Trump voters. The Associated Press reported that the change was made ""after the press office ‘conferred with the president,’ according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers’ office."" Biden's comment spread like wildfire on social media as Vice President Kamala Harris was making her final pitch to voters in a major Ellipse speech outside the White House. The president took to X, attempting to clarify what he meant to say:""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,"" Biden wrote on X. ""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.""Trump himself reacted to the ""terrible"" comment while speaking at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania. ""Remember Hillary? She said ‘deplorable' and then said ‘irredeemable,’ right? But she said ‘deplorable.' That didn't work out. ‘Garbage’ I think is worse,"" Trump said to his supporters. ""But he doesn't know— you have to please forgive him. Please forgive him. For he not knoweth what he said.""  ""And I'm convinced he likes me more than he likes Kamala,"" Trump quipped. Trump maximized Biden's blunder by hopping in a garbage truck in Green Bay, Wisconsin, while wearing a neon orange safety vest, which he later wore to a rally.Harris distanced herself from Biden's ""garbage"" insult while fielding questions from reporters.""I think that first of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,"" Harris said, adding that she believes the work she does is about representing all Americans, whether they support her or not.Harris also told reporters she did speak with the president on Tuesday night, but his ""garbage"" comment did not come up during their conversation.",31-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-house-altered-bidens-garbage-transcript-despite-concerns-from-stenographers
Pennsylvania Supreme Court sides with GOP in last-minute mail-in ballot dispute,"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court shut down an effort to allow mail-in ballots lacking a handwritten date to be counted in the 2024 election.The ruling overturns a decision from a Commonwealth Court finding that the state law requiring a handwritten date was unconstitutional. The Pennsylvania GOP appealed that ruling to the state supreme court, and now undated mail-in ballots will not be counted in the upcoming election.Justice Kevin Dougherty admonished the Commonwealth Court for its ruling in a forcefully-worded opinion relating to Friday's ruling.""'This Court will neither impose nor countenance substantial alterations to existing laws and procedures during the pendency of an ongoing election.’ We said those carefully chosen words only weeks ago. Yet they apparently were not heard in the Commonwealth Court, the very court where the bulk of election litigation unfolds,"" Dougherty wrote.""Today’s order, which I join, rights the ship. And it sends a loud message to all courts in this Commonwealth: in declaring we would not countenance substantial alterations to existing laws and procedures during the pendency of an ongoing election, we said what we meant and meant what we said,"" he continued.Pennsylvania Republicans hailed the Friday ruling, saying Democrats have repeatedly tried to subvert the dating requirement.""The Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the law, and the dated ballot requirement will be in effect for this election. Democrats have repeatedly tried to eliminate this important ballot safeguard, and we have stopped them each time,"" RNC Chairman  Michael Whatley said in a statement. ""We are committed to protecting critical ballot safeguards to ensure every ballot is cast and counted properly and will continue to fight across Pennsylvania to Protect the Vote.""State officials in favor of allowing undated ballots to be counted argue the change would make process easier for election workers. The Pennsylvania Department of State filed a brief in favor of the change prior to the court's ruling on Friday.""The requirement that county boards set aside mail ballots with declaration-date errors — and particularly the requirement that they set aside mail ballot envelopes with ‘incorrect’ dates — imposed a significant burden on county boards. Election workers must manually review every ballot envelope to determine whether it has a ‘correct’ date,"" the brief said, according to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star.Friday's ruling was the second time this month that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has blocked Democrat-backed efforts to dismantle the dating requirement.",2-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-supreme-court-sides-gop-last-minute-mail-in-ballot-dispute
"Trump campaign's closing message to voters: 'Harris broke it, Trump will fix it'","With less than two weeks until Election Day, the Trump campaign is giving its closing message to voters: Vice President Harris ""broke it"" and former President Trump ""will fix it,"" officials told Fox News Digital as they previewed their strategy for the final stretch. Fox News Digital spoke exclusively with Trump campaign officials about the former president’s strategy to rally supporters to the ballot box on Nov. 5, or before, by focusing heavily on the economy and the crisis at the southern border.""Kamala Harris for the last four years has wrecked the economy and the border,"" Trump campaign senior advisor Tim Murtaugh told Fox News Digital. ""Donald Trump will fix both of them."" Murtaugh said that ""the beauty of this election cycle is that everybody who is going to vote has lived through the Trump years and the Harris years.""""They have experienced both administrations. When Trump was president, the economy was fantastic, inflation was nonexistent, the border was secure, and the world was at peace,"" Murtaugh said. ""By contrast, under Harris’ leadership, the economy is in shambles, inflation is still sky-high, our border has been erased, and the world, at large, is on fire.""Trump has relentlessly hammered home that message in stop after stop as he crisscrosses the country campaigning in the final weeks of the cycle, something his campaign believes has given him momentum over the vice president who they say has largely shifted her message to attacking the former president.""Trump is talking about solving problems for Americans while Kamala Harris is focused exclusively on attacking him,"" a campaign official told Fox News Digital.Harris on Tuesday accused Trump of seeking ""unchecked power"" and being ""unhinged and unstable.""But the Trump campaign said the former president is ""asking people to vote for something, while she is asking for people to vote against something."" ""He is selling optimism and positive messages to fix the problems she and President Biden created,"" a campaign official said. The latest Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump leading Harris nationally by 2 points. Trump grabs 47% support among likely voters nationwide, with Harris at 45%, according to the WSJ survey- on a ballot that also includes third-party and independent candidates.That's a switch from the Journal's previous national survey - conducted in late August - which indicated Harris with a two point edge.The survey indicates views of Harris have turned more negative since August, with her favorable rating eight points underwater and her approval rating as vice president at 42%-54%. Meanwhile, views of Trump have improved, with voters approving of his past performance in the White House by a 52%-48% margin.And the latest Fox News Poll shows Trump ahead of Harris 50% to 48% nationally.""Donald Trump is leading all the battleground states, and the momentum and polling averages continue to move in his direction,"" Murtaugh said, citing national trends.Campaign officials pointed to ads being run in the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by vulnerable incumbent Democrats who have sought to distance themselves from Harris.Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., is running an ad in the Keystone State highlighting how he ""bucked Biden"" and ""sided with"" Trump while painting the Democrat senator as an ""independent."" The ad features a Republican woman and her Democrat husband and does not once mention Harris.Similar ads featuring Trump are running in Wisconsin for Sen. Tammy Baldwin and in Michigan for Rep. Elissa Slotkin who is running for Senate. ""Democrat Senate candidates are spending Democrat donor money promoting Donald Trump in the Blue Wall battleground states,"" an official said.And the latest USA Today/Suffolk University poll also showed Trump leading by a margin with a key group: Latino voters. Trump is leading Harris by 11 percentage points in that critical voting bloc""But the polls are only theoretical election results and polls don’t win races. Actual votes win elections, and that’s why we’re continuing to accelerate,"" Murtaugh added. ""And we’ll run through the tape on Election Day."" The Trump campaign said it is confident they have the ""momentum.""""President Trump will be relentless and tireless,"" an official told Fox News Digital. ""He’ll be barnstorming the country — rinse and repeat — over and over and over again until Election Day.""Trump held events in battleground Georgia on Tuesday, holding a massive rally with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, country music singer Jason Aldean and former collegiate athlete Riley Gaines.Trump this week made a campaign stop at a McDonald’s location in Pennsylvania to mock Harris for claiming that she once worked at the fast-food chain.""The McDonald’s trip was an encapsulation of his positive message,"" an official said. ""He is a cheerful, optimistic guy who knows he can fix it. And what was the Harris campaign’s reaction? They mocked it."" The Harris campaign blasted that campaign stop as a ""staged photo-op,"" saying Trump ""doesn't understand what it's like to work for a living"" and that the vice president ""has a record of standing up for workers and taking on bad actors who rip people off, and she’ll do the same as President.""The next scheduled stops for Trump include major campaign rallies in Tempe, Arizona; Las Vegas; Traverse City, Michigan; Novi, Michigan; State College, Pennsylvania; and then a massive rally on Sunday at New York City’s Madison Square Garden.Campaign officials said the former president will continue to engage with the press and sit for major media interviews. On Friday, Trump will be interviewed for the Joe Rogan podcast. Rogan has 17 million subscribers on YouTube and 14 million on Spotify. And his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, will also continue engaging with the media and has already held major campaign events this week in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada. In the coming days, Vance will be in Waterford, Michigan, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.But Trump campaign surrogates are also hosting major events, including Donald Trump Jr. campaigning in battleground states; a Trump campaign bus tour; and Women for Trump visiting areas damaged by recent hurricanes.Even Dr. Phil and RFK Jr. are joining forces to host a ""Make America Healthy Again"" event in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.And Trump campaign officials expressed the importance of early voting and are encouraging their supporters to ""vote by any way they possibly can."" ""Whether they vote by mail, vote early in person, vote on Election Day, we want them to make a plan to vote,"" an official said. ""We need people to show up. And we are getting to the point where persuasion is almost over, and now we are getting to turnout.""Meanwhile, Harris' campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.Harris, though, is expected to deliver what's being described as a major ""closing argument"" address next Tuesday - one week until Election Day - on the Ellipse, which is just south of the White House and north of the National Mall. The Harris campaign spotlighted that then-President Trump headlined a large rally of supporters at the Ellipse on Jan 6, 2021.Her campaign this week also announced a new concert series featuring Bruce Springsteen and former President Obama, while the Democratic National Committee launched a new Taylor Swift-themed, get-out-the-vote campaign for young voters. As for President Biden, he’s largely stayed off the campaign trail as Harris alternates between promising to continue the policies and vision of the Biden-Harris administration while also promising to bring ""a new way forward."" But on Tuesday, Biden weighed in. ""We got to lock him up,"" Biden said of Trump. However, the president quickly added, ""Politically lock him up, lock him out. That’s what we have to do."" A Trump campaign official reacted, telling Fox News Digital that ""for four years, it has been clear to the American people that the Biden-Harris administration has been using the weight of the federal government to go after Donald Trump and his supporters.""

"Biden congratulates Trump, pledges 'peaceful and orderly' transfer of power","President Biden addressed the nation from the Rose Garden on Thursday after his vice president, Kamala Harris, conceded the 2024 presidential election to President-elect Trump.In brief remarks, Biden announced that he spoke with Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on his victory and assure him that the entire Biden administration will work with his team ""to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition."" ""That's what the American people deserve,"" Biden said. He also praised Harris for running ""an inspiring campaign,"" and said she has ""great character"" and ""backbone like a ramrod."" Trump will make a triumphant return to the White House in January after more than 72 million Americans voted for him, securing at least 295 Electoral College votes and a majority of the national popular vote. Harris claimed 226 Electoral College votes and won at least 68 million votes. Ballots are still being counted in several states. The results were the culmination of a tumultuous campaign, which saw the incumbent Biden win the Democratic primary only for him to withdraw from the race, at the urging of his party, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June. Harris was then nominated by Democrats to bear their standard without contest and without earning a single primary vote. During the campaign, both Harris and Biden called Trump a ""fascist"" and argued that his re-election to the presidency would threaten democracy and prove dangerous to the American people. But after Trump's decisive win, Biden changed his tune to emphasize unity. On Thursday, the president spoke about political campaigns as a ""contest of competing visions."" ""A country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made. I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor only when you agree. Something I hope we can do, no matter who you voted for, you see each other not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans,"" he said. Biden also said he hopes the 2024 election will ""lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system."" ""It is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent, and it can be trusted. Win or lose,"" he said. The televised address comes after Harris conceded to Trump on Wednesday. The vice president made her first public comments about the race at Howard University, her alma mater, where she said that ""while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign."" In a staff memo earlier, her campaign manager and Biden ally Jen O'Malley Dillon called the defeat ""unfathomably painful."" ""This will take a long time to process. But the work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,"" she vowed.Biden, in his speech, said ""setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable."" ""We all get knocked down. But the measure of our character, as my dad would say, is how quickly we get back up. Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated. We lost this battle. The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up,"" he said. ",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-congratulates-trump-pledges-peaceful-orderly-transfer-power
Trump earns endorsement from 'highly respected' Muslim leaders in battleground state,"Former President Trump earned endorsements from ""highly respected"" Muslim leaders and Imams during a campaign rally in the battleground state of Michigan. Trump, speaking to a crowd in Novi, Michigan, on Saturday afternoon, called the group of Muslim leaders ""highly respected,"" before bringing them onstage.""I’m thrilled to accept the endorsement of these highly respected leaders,"" Trump told the thundering crowd.The group of leaders cited Trump’s commitment to ending wars and ensuring global peace as a primary reason for their support, describing him as a leader who ""promises peace, not war.""""We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war!"" Imam Belal Alzuhairi said. ""We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine,"" Alzuhairi said. ""The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make that happen.

""These are great people.""The Muslim leaders official endorsement came after Amer Ghalib, the mayor of the Detroit-area suburb Hamtramck, announced his support of Trump in a Facebook post on Oct. 20.""Though it’s looking good, he may or may not win the election and be the 47th president of the United States, but I believe he is the right choice for this critical time,"" Ghalib wrote in Arabic on his Facebook page. ""I’ll not regret my decision no matter what the outcome would be, and I’m ready to face the consequences. For this, and for many other reasons, I announce my support and endorsement for the former, and hopefully, the next President of the United States, Donald Trump.""Ghalib’s endorsement of Trump comes after the two met in Flint earlier this week for a private 20-minute conversation. Ghalib told The Detroit News that Trump ""knew a lot about me before the meeting."" ""We talked about various topics including the debates, the polls updates, the statistics of votes in Michigan and Wayne County, the Arab American concerns and the Yemeni Americans in particular. We also talked about the situation in Yemen,"" Ghalib said.Swing state statusThe critical swing state of Michigan has seen record-breaking early voting numbers so far.According to data on the Michigan Department of State’s dashboard, over 1.2 million voters in Michigan have already cast a ballot in this year’s election, taking advantage of either early voting and mail-in balloting, while shattering the previous record for early ballot returns in the state.",26-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-earns-endorsement-highly-respected-muslim-leaders-battleground-state
"Trump, Harris dead even in national poll, with just one in four saying country headed in right direction","A new poll has found former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in a dead heat among voters, with only one in four saying that the country is heading in the right direction. Both candidates are tied with 48% of the popular vote in the New York Times/Siena College survey of 2,516 likely voters nationwide between Oct. 20 and Oct. 23, which has a 2.5% margin of error. Harris led Trump nationally 49% to 46% the last time this poll was conducted in early October. Just 28% of those who responded feel the U.S. is heading in the right direction with President Biden and Harris in the White House, compared to 61% who believe it’s heading in the wrong direction. Twenty-seven percent of voters said the economy – including jobs and the stock market – is their most important issue in deciding their vote in November, followed by abortion and immigration, each at 15%. When the likely voters were asked who would do a better job handling the economy, voters preferred Trump by 6%.  That is down from the 13-point advantage Trump had over Harris the last time this poll was conducted, the New York Times reported. Harris maintains a 16% lead over Trump when it comes to protecting abortion access, while Trump holds an 11% advantage on the topic of immigration, the poll also found. As for President Biden, only 40% of respondents said they either strongly or somewhat approve of the job he is doing in the Oval Office as his administration is winding down. Biden’s age of 81 was a concern among Americans earlier this year while he was still planning his re-election bid, but with just weeks to go until Election Day, the poll results show that 41% of likely voters feel that the 78-year-old Trump is just too old to be an effective president, compared to 58% who don’t.

Trump nominates Marco Rubio to serve as Secretary of State,"President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to serve as his Secretary of State. ""It is my Great Honor to announce that Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, is hereby nominated to be The United States Secretary of State. Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.""In a statement, Rubio, 53, said he was ""honored"" by the trust Trump ""has placed in me.""""As Secretary of State, I will work every day to carry out his foreign policy agenda,"" Rubio wrote on X.

The son of Cuban exiles, the three-term senator is known on Capitol Hill as a foreign policy hawk who favors maintaining U.S. alliances overseas, including NATO. For example, he voted against the $95 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine and has urged the eastern European nation to negotiate an end to its war with Russia.However, Rubio, who sits on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, has taken similar positions to Trump on international conflicts, including Israel's war with Hamas. He has also publicly supported Israel's right to defend itself. In his announcement, Trump described Rubio as ""a strong Advocate for our nation, a true friend to our allies, and a fearless warrior who will never back down to our adversaries.""""I look forward to working with Marco to Make America, and the World, Safe and Great Again!"" he said.

He was Trump's rival during his 2016 campaign, where both men sparred during televised debates. Trump sometimes belittled him, sometimes calling him ""little Marco.""

8 states will vote on measures that would explicitly ban noncitizens from voting,"Eight states will take to the polls on Tuesday to decide on ballot measures that would require proof of U.S. citizenship to vote. Ballot measures in Iowa, Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Missouri and Wisconsin come after House Republicans passed a bill over the summer that would require proof of citizenship to vote. That bill has not been taken up by the Senate. Some municipalities allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, like Washington, D.C., and a handful in Maryland, Vermont and California. New York City’s law allowing noncitizen voting was struck down in court earlier this year. The wave of noncitizen ballot referenda began with North Dakota in 2018, when the state constitution was amended, changing the wording from ""every citizen"" to ""only a citizen"" regarding voting eligibility.Voters in Florida, Colorado and Alabama passed identical language changes in the 2020 elections. Ohio and Louisiana followed suit in 2022.While noncitizen voting in federal elections is illegal, Republicans argue there is no adequate enforcement in place, and such unlawful voting could tilt the results of the presidential election. Iowa Iowa’s state constitution currently lists the voting age at 21, but the state has been following the 26th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which set the voting age at 18.A proposed state constitutional amendment would mandate that ""only a citizen of the United States of the age of eighteen years,"" changing both the age and existing language from ""every citizen"" to ""only a citizen."" The amendment would also delineate that only those who live in the state can vote in its elections. On Sunday, a federal judge ruled that he would not block Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate’s challenge to the ballots of roughly 2,200 suspected noncitizens.The ACLU of Iowa had filed a lawsuit on behalf of four naturalized citizens who had their registrations challenged. Pate required any potential noncitizen on his list to vote with a provisional ballot and return to the county auditor’s office with proof of citizenship for their vote to count. A new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday found Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by three percentage points in the state, 47% to 44%. North Carolina North Carolina’s GOP-led legislature passed a bill that put forth an amendment that would change the state constitution’s requirements to vote. The document currently says ""every person born in the United States and every person who has been naturalized"" can vote in North Carolina if they are over 18 and a U.S. resident. The amendment would alter the text to ""only a citizen of the United States"" can vote if they have met the other requirements. North Carolina does not require proof of citizenship to vote but requires people to swear they are a citizen and otherwise eligible to vote or risk felony charges of perjury. North Carolina is one of seven key swing states in the presidential election. South CarolinaSimilarly, a ballot measure in South Carolina would change the state’s constitution to read that ""only a citizen of the United States and of this State"" who is at least 18 years of age and ""properly registered"" can vote. Currently, it reads ""every citizen"" who has met the other qualifications can vote. ""It doesn't make it harder for a legal voter in the state to vote, but it does make clear in South Carolina we will not open ourselves up to lawsuits by groups that are pushing noncitizens to vote in elections anywhere in the state,"" state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, the lead sponsor of the bill that established the measure, told a local news outlet. ""We have had multiple court challenges across the United States in multiple jurisdictions where some courts have upheld municipal governments or school boards extending the right to vote to those who are not legally in this country,"" Kimbrell said. ""We want to remove any ambiguity in South Carolina.""WisconsinWisconsin’s Republican-led legislature voted to add a measure on noncitizen voting to the November ballot to amend the state’s constitution to say ""only"" U.S. citizens who are 18 or older can vote, rather than ""every"" citizen who is 18 and older.Idaho The Idaho constitution currently states that ""every male or female citizen of the United States"" who meets certain age and residency requirements is eligible to vote in the state. The ballot referendum would explicitly amend the state’s constitution to say that noncitizens are barred from voting in any election in the state. KentuckyA ballot measure in Kentucky proposes an addition to the state constitution stating, ""No person who is not a citizen of the United States shall be allowed to vote in this state.""The state’s constitution currently expresses, ""Every citizen of the United States of the age of eighteen years who has resided in the state one year, and in the county six months, and the precinct in which he offers to vote sixty days next preceding the election, shall be a voter in said precinct and not elsewhere.""MissouriIf successful, Missouri’s ballot measure would change the state’s constitution to say ""only citizens of the United States"" can vote in elections. Currently, it says ""All citizens of the United States"" over the age of 18 and those who reside in Missouri ""are entitled to vote at all elections.""However, the amendment would also outlaw ranked choice voting, which allows voters to rank their choice of candidates in order or preference.

Glenn Youngkin's administration for removing people from the voter rolls who had been identified as noncitizens and could not verify their citizenship within a two-week grace period. The state said it removed 6,000 ineligible people from its rolls.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in August that more than 6,500 potential noncitizens had been removed from the state's voter rolls since 2021. Ohio Secretary of State Frank La Rose also said in August that he referred 138 apparent noncitizens found to have voted in a recent election for prosecution.

GOP Rep. Mike Waltz tapped to be Trump's national security adviser,"Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., has been offered the role of national security adviser in the next Trump administration, a source confirmed to Fox News Digital.Waltz has been one of President-elect Trump's most visible surrogates during the 2024 campaign, spearheading military outreach and helping with the Veterans For Trump coalition.The Florida congressman is the first retired Green Beret to serve in Congress and had previous administration experience as a policy adviser to former Defense Secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates.The Wall Street Journal first reported Waltz being offered the role. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.Elevating a House lawmaker to the administration could complicate Republicans' ability to govern the chamber, however.Waltz is in a safe red seat on the eastern Florida coast, so it's highly unlikely to fall into Democratic hands. But replacing a House member is a process that could take several weeks.Republicans are on track to win the House majority by just a slim margin, so whittling down their numbers in Congress could fuel delays to Trump's own first 100-day agenda.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., speculated on Fox & Friends last week that Republicans would win by about four to six seats.Waltz is the second House lawmaker tapped for an administration role after House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., accepted Trump's nomination to be ambassador to the United Nations earlier on Monday.Both Stefanik and Waltz are members of the House Armed Services Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. ""I am truly honored to earn President Trump's nomination to serve in his Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. During my conversation with President Trump, I shared how deeply humbled I am to accept his nomination and that I look forward to earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate,"" Stefanik said in her statement accepting the nomination.""The work ahead is immense as we see antisemitism skyrocketing coupled with four years of catastrophically weak U.S. leadership that significantly weakened our national security and diminished our standing in the eyes of both allies and adversaries. I stand ready to advance President Donald J. Trump’s restoration of America First peace through strength leadership on the world stage on Day One at the United Nations.""Like Waltz, Stefanik's upstate New York district is a safe Republican stronghold.The NSA role does not require Senate confirmation, but the role of UN ambassador does.Sources previously told Fox News Digital that Waltz was in contention for the role of Secretary of Defense.

"Youngkin vows to appeal 'to SCOTUS' after US judge orders 1,600 voters back on ballot","A federal judge on Friday ordered Virginia to halt its removal of potential non-citizens from state voter rolls, a decision expected to restore the voting rights to some 1,600 residents ahead of Election Day.Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin told Fox News shortly after the ruling that his administration is planning to file an emergency stay for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to block the injunction, which he noted was handed down just 11 days before the election. He added that his administration would appeal it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.""This is a stunning ruling by a federal judge who is ordering Virginia to reinstate individuals who have self-identified as noncitizens back on the voter rolls,"" Youngkin said on air on Fox News Channel via telephone shortly after the judge's decision was announced.His remarks come after U.S. Judge Patricia Giles issued a preliminary injunction Friday to reinstate all voters that had been removed from state voter rolls in the state in the last 90 days, finding that the removals had been in fact ""systematic,"" not individualized, and were thus a violation of federal law. Giles said Friday that there is reason to believe voters in Virginia were being mistakenly removed from the rolls. ""This process has resulted in eligible voters having their voting registration flagged,"" she said in issuing the preliminary injunction. And while Giles concurred it is ""undoubtedly in the public interest for ineligible voters to be removed,"" she noted it is also in the public interest ""for states to comply with federal law particularly the right to vote.""The preliminary injunction handed down by a federal judge in Alexandria comes just weeks after the Department of Justice sued Virginia over its program, arguing the removals were conducted too close to the Nov. 5 elections and violate the National Voter Registration Act — a federal law that requires states to halt all systematic voter roll maintenance for a 90-day ""quiet period"" before an election.Justice Department officials also cited concerns that eligible votes may have incorrectly been removed from the rolls without adequate notice, or enough time to correct the mistake.""States may remove names from official lists of voters in various ways and for various reasons, but they may not carry on this kind of systematic removal program so close to a federal election,"" DOJ officials wrote in filing their Oct. 11 lawsuit.The injunction upholds this line of thinking, and sparked fierce, immediate pushback from Youngkin, who has insisted the voters were removed legally and has himself objected to a court ruling less than two weeks before a federal election.""This is a stunning ruling by a federal judge who is ordering Virginia to reinstate individuals who have self-identified as noncitizens back on the voter rolls,"" Youngkin said on Fox News Channel via telephone shortly after the judge's decision was announced.At issue was an executive order signed by Youngkin in August that authorized the state to conduct ""daily"" updates to its voter rolls. The order allowed the state to compare its Department of Motor Vehicles' noncitizens list against its list of registered voters. Those without citizenship were then informed that their voter registration would be canceled unless they could prove their citizenship in 14 days.Youngkin has insisted the voters were removed legally and is based on precedent from a 2006 state law enacted by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat. Youngkin previously defended the state's system, which he insisted is not systematic and instead uses an ""individualized process"" to determine and notify potential noncitizens that they had been included on the voter registration list, and without further action, would be removed.

Harris responds to Biden 'garbage' remark for first time,"President Biden’s ""garbage"" comment while talking about Trump supporters has the U.S. political world talking out loud, and Vice President Kamala Harris responded to the controversy for the first time on Wednesday.Biden made his remark during a Zoom call on Tuesday with Voto Latino, one of the largest Latino voter and civic outreach organizations in the U.S. Harris, speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force Two, noted that Biden had ""clarified his comments.""""I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,"" Harris said. ""You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not.""Harris added that Biden had called her Tuesday night after the event, but she said they did not discuss his ""garbage"" comment.During Tuesday's Zoom call, Biden was asked about a comment made Sunday during a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in which comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage.""Outrage spewed from Democrats over the next two days saying Trump’s campaign should not refer to Puerto Rico like that.Then, as Harris was holding her last major campaign event — and not far from the White House — Biden was asked what he thought of Hinchcliffe’s comedy bit at the Trump rally in New York.""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,"" Biden said. ""[Trump's] demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it is un-American.""Biden tweeted later that evening, ""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.""Harris' running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday, ""The president's clarified his remarks, but let's be very clear. The vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this. Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric is what needs to end. He called this a garbage country and continues on from ‘the enemy within.’ What you heard Vice President Harris say and what I say is, there's a place for all of us here, and I think that's the one. She's running for president. She's making the message and she delivered that speech on the Ellipse that showed what we can be as a country. So, I think America knows the direction we're going. She's laid out a new way forward, and that's what we're going to do for the next six days and then the next eight years after that.""Harris campaign senior adviser Stephanie Cutter told MSNBC, ""The president did clarify what he was talking about, but the vice president has been clear that her campaign, her presidency is about all Americans. And, you know, when she's president, she's not going to care who you voted for. She's going to fight for you regardless, and I also want to say, spare me the faux outrage from Donald Trump, JD Vance and his campaign. Even as they're trying to argue that President Biden is disparaging Trump voters, the president is calling the entire country a trash can. You know, even at the Madison Square Garden [event], his supporters not only disparaged Puerto Rican Americans, but disparaged all Latinos. So, spare me the faux outrage.""Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. Harris had responded to the Sunday afternoon comments by Hinchcliffe within several hours, with a 9:53 p.m. tweet.Many top Republicans who are seeking re-election — like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Rick Scott — have also been quiet since Biden called many of their voters ""garbage.""Based on the 74.2 million votes that Trump received in the 2020 election, according to the Federal Elections Commission, the sitting president called nearly half of the country’s voters ""garbage.""",30-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-campaign-silent-after-bidens-garbage-gaffe-referring-trump-supporters
"Arizona election ballots damaged after USPS mailbox lit on fire, suspect arrested","Around 20 mail-in ballots have been damaged in Phoenix after an arson suspect set fire to a U.S. Postal Service mailbox, officials say. Dieter Klofkorn, 35, has been arrested on one felony count of Arson to Property following the incident that unfolded early Thursday morning in Arizona’s capital. ""Klofkorn stated that he committed the arson because he wanted to be arrested and that his actions were not politically motivated and not related to anything involving the upcoming election,"" the Phoenix Police Department said in a statement. Images taken from the scene showed a charred mailbox outside a U.S. Post Office near 3900 North 7th Avenue. The Phoenix Fire Department says the suspect ""arrived early Thursday... and lit a fire inside the blue drive-up collection mailbox"" before crews responded, forced the box open and extinguished the flames. ""Approximately 20 electoral ballots were damaged, along with additional miscellaneous mail,"" the fire department added, according to Fox10 Phoenix. ""The Postal Inspector took possession of the damaged ballots and mail."" The station also cited Phoenix Police Sgt.

FEMA official fired for directing hurricane relief away from Trump supporters' homes,"A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) official who instructed Hurricane Milton relief workers to skip homes with Trump signs has been fired from her role, a FEMA spokesperson tells Fox News, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is investigating the federal agency over the controversy. The FEMA official, who has not been named by the agency, instructed workers canvassing Lake Placid in Florida to ""avoid homes advertising Trump,"" as they ascertained what residents could qualify for federal aid, according to internal messages first obtained by the Daily Wire. The Daily Wire reports that government employees told the outlet that at least 20 homes with Trump signs or flags were bypassed from the end of October and into November due to the ""best practices"" guidance from the official. The houses were skipped over by the workers, who wrote messages such as: ""Trump sign no entry per leadership,"" in a government system, per the outlet. On Saturday, FEMA's administrator on employee misconduct, Deanne Criswell, confirmed to Fox News Digital that the employee had been fired, calling her actions ""reprehensible"" and a clear violation of FEMA’s core values and principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation.""We take our mission to help everyone before, during and after disasters seriously. This employee has been terminated and we have referred the matter to the Office of Special Counsel,"" Criswell said. ""I will continue to do everything I can to make sure this never happens again.""A FEMA spokesperson told Fox News Friday that it is ""deeply disturbed"" by the employee’s actions and that it is an ""isolated incident."" ""FEMA helps all survivors regardless of their political preference or affiliation,"" the spokesperson said via a statement. ""The employee who issued this guidance had no authority and was given no direction to tell teams to avoid these homes and we are reaching out to the people who may have not been reached as a result of this incident,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the agency has helped more than 365,000 households impacted by both Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida and provided nearly $900 million in direct assistance to survivors.""""We are horrified that this took place and therefore have taken extreme actions to correct this situation and have ensured that the matter was addressed at all levels.""The FEMA agents were ordered not to help houses with Trump signs in Highlands County, a deep-red area located in south central Florida that was hit with tornadoes, torrential rain and flooding when the Category 3 Hurricane slammed into The Sunshine State in October. President-elect Trump won nearly 70% of the vote there on Tuesday. DeSantis slammed the federal agency Friday after learning about the official’s actions and announced his administration will investigate FEMA over the incident.""The blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days,"" DeSantis wrote on X. ""At my direction, the Division of Emergency Management is launching an investigation into the federal government's targeted discrimination of Floridians who support Donald Trump. New leadership is on the way to D.C., and I'm optimistic that these partisan bureaucrats will be fired.""U.S. House Oversight Committee and Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., also took aim at the agency, in particular for not firing the official.He said it comes despite the IRS trying to force whistleblower Gary Shapley out of that agency. Shapley, an IRS supervisory special agent, brought claims of political influence in the Hunter Biden investigation to Congress, along with Joseph Ziegler, IRS criminal investigator.""FEMA hasn’t fired this person… But the IRS has been trying to force IRS whistleblower Gary Shapley out for blowing the whistle! We must hold these unelected bureaucrats accountable,"" Comer wrote on X.""FEMA admits this happened but doesn’t say if the bureaucrat responsible has been fired,"" the House Oversight Committee wrote on X. ""Democrats relentlessly defend the rules that insulate unelected bureaucrats from accountability and make it nearly impossible to fire bad employees. This is why we need President Trump’s reforms to make bureaucrats accountable.""Donald Trump Jr., the president-elect’s son, also blasted the agency. ""This is outrageous even for the democrats in charge and should be criminal,"" Trump Jr wrote on X. ""These people should be ousted from FEMA, Government and society!

Trump hits Wisconsin in garbage truck 'in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden',"Former President Trump rolled up to the battleground state of Wisconsin in a garbage truck on Wednesday, an apparent reference to President Biden's remarks about supporters of the Republican nominee, which has caused a firestorm for Vice President Kamala Harris in the final days of a hotly contested election. Trump was pictured in Green Bay inside a white garbage truck wearing an orange reflective vest with ""Trump Make America Great Again 2024"" emblazoned on the vehicle. ""How do you like my garbage truck?"" Trump asked reporters. ""This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden.""The stunt is an apparent dig at Biden, who has come under fire for calling Trump supporters garbage. During a virtual Harris campaign call with Voto Latino, Biden took a swipe at former Trump's weekend rally in Madison Square Garden, which made headlines after insult comedian Tony Hinchiffe made jokes mocking different ethnic groups, with one joke referring to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage.""""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,"" Biden said. ""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it is un-American.""The comment quickly went viral and sparked swift condemnation from critics. Biden's remarks were quickly compared to Hillary Clinton, who declared that Trump supporters were ""deplorables"" during the 2016 presidential race. Trump himself reacted to the ""terrible"" comment from Biden while speaking at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania. ""Remember Hillary? She said ‘deplorable' and then said ‘irredeemable,’ right? But she said ‘deplorable.' That didn't work out. ‘Garbage’ I think is worse,"" Trump said to his supporters at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania on Tuesday night. ""But he doesn't know- you have to please forgive him. Please forgive him. For he not knoweth what he said.""  ""And I'm convinced he likes me more than he likes Kamala,"" Trump quipped.On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden doesn't view Trump supporters as ""garbage.""""He has said multiple times that he is a president for all. It doesn't matter if in a red state. It doesn't matter if you live in a blue state,"" she said. Vivek Ramaswamy was also seen riding on the back of a garbage truck in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday. Ramaswamy, who threw his support to Trump after dropping out of the presidential race, wore a yellow reflective vest while greeting supporters.

"Trump's first Cabinet picks decidedly not isolationists: Ukraine, Israel breathe a sigh of relief","Despite his own isolationist musings, the first picks of President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration hail from a decidedly more traditionalist wing of the Republican Party.On Tuesday, Trump formally announced that Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., would be his national security adviser. Sources have said Trump is set on tapping Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for secretary of state.Together with New York Rep. Elise Stefanik — set for the role of ambassador to the United Nations — the trio is expected to further a staunchly pro-Israel agenda.Ukrainian advocates are also somewhat relieved. ""Kyiv looks at these appointments with some quiet relief — they clearly know there's room for engagement,"" one source familiar with Ukrainian operations told Fox News Digital. They added that after a Biden administration that they believe has been overly fearful of escalating U.S. involvement in the war with Russia, ""a not insignificant number of senior Ukrainian officials are cautiously optimistic about what a change of pace might look like. Waltz, who once served as a counterterrorism adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney, is widely regarded as a hawk on China and Iran. He was vociferously opposed to President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. ""What no one can ever do for me, including this administration right now, is articulate a counterterrorism plan that’s realistic without us there,"" Waltz said in an interview days after the withdrawal. The former Army Green Beret officer and ex-CEO of a defense contracting company introduced legislation during the first Trump administration that would have prevented a mass troop drawdown in Afghanistan unless the director of national intelligence certified that the Taliban would not associate with al-Qaeda. ""I think we're in for a long haul and I think our nation's leadership needs to begin telling the American people, 'I'm sorry. We don't have a choice. We're 15 years into what is going to be a multi-generational war because we're talking about defeating an idea,'"" Waltz said about Afghanistan at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2017.Waltz voted for keeping the Iraq War Authorization on the books in 2021 and voted against ending U.S. support for the Saudi war in Yemen. In an interview with NPR last week, Waltz said the war between Russia and Ukraine can end if the U.S. applies some leverage. Russia's ""war machine will dry up very quickly"" with U.S. economic sanctions, Waltz said, as well as ""taking the handcuffs off of the long-range weapons we provided Ukraine."" Biden has long refused to allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons to strike deep inside Russia. Last month, when Israel conducted a counterstrike on Iran's military targets, Waltz bemoaned that it hadn't gone after Iran's oil and nuclear facilities. ""Did Biden/Harris pressure Israel once again to do less than it should?"" he questioned. Rubio, meanwhile, is a noted hawk on China, Iran and Venezuela, where he has been working to unseat dictator Nicolas Maduro. Rubio, at one time, supported U.S. aid to Ukraine, but when the matter came up again earlier this year, he was one of 15 Republicans to vote against a supplemental funding package, citing insufficient border provisions.He's been a strong proponent of U.S. support for Taiwan. When Trump raised concerns about the U.S.'s support for Taiwan and suggested the island should pay the U.S. for its defense, Rubio predicted Trump would ""continue to support Taiwan"" if he reclaimed the White House.Like Trump, both Waltz and Rubio have been critical of NATO allies for not spending enough on defense. Rubio has insisted Europe should ""take the lead"" on its defense: ""Germany, France, and the United Kingdom are more than capable of managing their relationship with the nuclear-armed belligerent to their east. But they’ll never take ownership so long as they can rely on America.""Rubio cosponsored legislation last year that would bar any president from pulling the U.S. from NATO without congressional approval, a measure that was seen as a precaution if Trump were to win the presidency and follow through with his frequent threats to abandon the alliance.His pick triggered some backlash from some Trump die-hards who view him as too hawkish. ""Apparently there hasn’t been a SOS pick yet FYSA [for your situational awareness],"" posted Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) late Monday on X, after news outlets began reporting Trump had settled on Rubio. Libertarian-minded comedian Dave Smith said Tuesday that Rubio is ""a disaster.""""Might as well give Liz Cheney the State Department,"" Smith wrote. ""Awful sign.""Stephen Wertheim, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that Waltz and Rubio signal ""above all, a hard line toward China not only on economics but across the board — on political, military, and ideological competition."" ""The picks leave me wondering whether Trump will deliver on his sometimes restrained foreign policy promises, including his stated desire to end the war in Ukraine sooner rather than later and to see Israel wrap up its wars,"" he said. ""I’m getting flashbacks to the first Trump administration.""But, he added, ""Rubio is no longer quite the Rubio many remember from 2016."" ""Rubio seems to understand that the United States faces resource constraints and needs to set strategic priorities in an increasingly competitive world.""And some restraint-minded thinkers hold out cautious optimism. ""If [Rubio] channels Trump’s approach rather than pursuing his own agenda, he could redefine the state department’s role in a way that is both respected and effective abroad. Rubio knows that his future prospects are tied to his ability to execute Trump’s policy, not personal ambitions,"" said Jason Beardsley, senior coalitions adviser for Concerned Veterans for America. ""Having worked closely with Waltz, I can vouch for his deep understanding of America’s strategic priorities. He’s passionate about reforming the DoD from within and ensuring national security without overextending our military in costly, unnecessary engagements.""",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/waltz-rubio-trump-national-security
When will we know who won the US election?,"With millions of voters expected to show up to the polls today, the world will be anxiously watching for the election results to start pouring in on Tuesday night.Here is what you need to know about the 2024 presidential election results.When do the polls close?Kentucky (eight electoral votes) will be the first state to close its polls at 6 p.m. Eastern.For most of the eastern half of the country, voting polls will close between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., while polls on the West Coast will close at 11 p.m. Eastern.The last states to close will be Hawaii (four electoral votes) and Alaska (three electoral votes), which will close their polls at midnight and 1 a.m. respectively.When will the 2024 Election Day results be announced?Election Day results have historically often been announced just hours after the polls close. However, recent elections have required longer waiting periods before all the votes can be tallied, and a winner can be declared.One reason for this is the prevalence of mail-in absentee voting. Fourteen states legally require that mail-in ballots be counted only after polls close on Election Day.The first election results of the night will likely begin being called after 7 p.m. Eastern. Results for some of the critical swing states such as Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes) will likely not be called till much later.In 2020, news outlets called the election in President Biden’s favor four days after Election Day. In 2016, the race was called in Trump’s favor at 3 a.m. the day after Election Day.The closer the election, the longer it will take to know the result. Barring an unexpected landslide victory by either candidate, the winner of the 2024 presidential election may not be known until a day or several days after Election Day.Election results may also be further delayed by legal challenges by either former President Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris.What are the key states to watch on Election Day?With 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, the 2024 presidential election is expected to be extremely close.There are seven states – Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada – considered close swing states. Experts will be closely watching these states as they will likely determine who the next president will be.Here is when polls will close in each of the swing states.7 p.m. Eastern – Georgia (16 electoral votes) 7:30 p.m. Eastern – North Carolina (16 electoral votes) 8 p.m. Eastern – Pennsylvania (except for Cambria County, which will close at 10 p.m. Eastern due to electronic voting system software issues) 9 p.m. Eastern – Michigan (15 electoral votes), Arizona (11 electoral votes) and Wisconsin (10 electoral votes) 10 p.m. Eastern – Nevada (six electoral votes) How do I watch the election live?You can stream Fox News election coverage live online.

FBI quietly updates crime data to show big jump in violence under Biden-Harris admin: 'Shocking',"The Federal Bureau of Investigation quietly updated its 2022 crime data to show an increase in violent crimes, despite previous data showing violent crimes had fallen that year, which was touted as a victory for the Biden-Harris administration. ""For some reason, the media, they did pick the crime data that they think goes and makes the Democrats look as good as possible. And then even when the crime data that they've relied on turns out by the very source of that data to be wrong, none of them fix it,"" John Lott, the founder and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview this week. The FBI released its annual crime in the nation data for 2022 last year, which found a 2.1% decrease in violent crimes compared to 2021, Lott explained. The data was lauded by Democrats and the media as part of a turning point for crime woes in the U.S., following the crime wave of 2020, when defund-the-police protests and riots swept the nation and the pandemic’s stay-at-home orders upended daily life.Now, the data reflects a net increase of 80,029 violent crimes in 2022 over 2021. Lott found that under the umbrella of violent crime, there were an additional 1,699 murders, 7,780 rapes, 33,459 robberies and 37,091 aggravated assaults that year.""To give people an idea of the size of the change, when the 2022 data came out in September 2023, they initially reported that violent crime had fallen by 2.1% in 2022.… That's the final data, supposedly, for 2022. The revision of that final data that came out last month, now claims that rather than the 2.1% drop, that there was actually a 4.5% increase in violent crime that occurred in 2022. That's a 6.6 percentage point change there,"" Lott told Fox News Digital. ""It's from a drop to an increase. And, you know, the bizarre thing to me is, for a year after the 2022 data was put out, we were having headlines, news articles after news articles saying, 'Violent crime is falling, people mistakenly or erroneously believe that it's increasing.' And, you know, and they were relying on this data. But you don't see any corrections in the news. Saying, ‘Oops, the FBI data that we relied on was wrong, that rather than a drop, there was actually an increase that had occurred,’"" he added. President Biden and the Harris campaign have touted that violent crimes had fallen under their leadership, with Biden calling the reported violent crime drops ""historic"" while citing the FBI’s most recent data. ""This year, the homicide and violent crime rates have continued their rapid decline from their peaks during the last administration,"" Biden said in an official White House statement late last month. ""... Communities across our country are safer now than when I took office.""""Americans are safer today than when Vice President Harris and I took office. We can’t stop now,"" Biden added in a separate White House statement in August touting crime data from an independent organization of police chiefs across the nation. The Trump campaign, when asked about the revised data, took a victory lap, saying, ""President Trump was right…. AGAIN!""""The federal government lied about Biden’s cognitive decline, lied about the job numbers, and now we learn they lied about crime numbers too,"" Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital. ""Kamala Harris must admit she’s wrong and address how she plans to bring down the rising crime crisis. Every mainstream media reporter who was quick to correct President Trump must cover this new revelation if they have any shred of integrity left.""Trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that ""crime in this country is through the roof"" under the Biden-Harris administration, despite the previous figures promoted by the FBI showing violent crime was allegedly on a downward trend. When asked about the revision, the White House argued that following the passage of the American Rescue Plan in 2021 under the Biden-Harris administration, violent crime is ""at a near 50-year low."" ""Under the previous administration, our country saw the biggest increase in murder rates on record. President Biden and Vice President Harris immediately got to work to turn it around and passed the American Rescue Plan, which led to the largest ever federal investment in public safety. As a result, violent crime is at a near 50-year low, and is continuing to decline this year according independent data from police chiefs in the nation’s largest cities,"" White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday. An administration official added in a comment to Fox Digital that the ""FBI often adjusts crime estimates as more data is reported.""""During the prior administration, the FBI upwardly adjusted crime data during its last three years: in 2018, 2019, and 2020. These adjustments are standard practice,"" the official continued before citing an article on the data this week. ""Real Clear Investigations fails to mention that, in 2021, there was a sharp decline in the number of agencies participating in FBI data collection because the FBI temporarily disallowed an earlier collection method. The FBI switched back to its prior method in 2022.""Lott explained he noticed the quiet update when the FBI released its 2023 crime data set last month, adding: ""It was pretty easy to see that things had changed.""""For 2022 and 2021 in particular, they had some changes for a few of the previous years, but they were very small. The changes for 2021 and 2022 were very large. You know, I looked through the press release that the FBI had put out, there was no mention of them having changed the data for earlier years. And surely no mention of the large change that had occurred. I looked through the Uniform Crime Report summary report that the FBI puts out, and there was no mention of the size of the change. There's one footnote there that vaguely mentions that they had updated the data for 2022. No mention about updating it for 2021 or any other time,"" he said, calling the discovery ""shocking."" The data update is akin to when the Bureau of Labor Statistics overestimated the number of jobs created in the U.S. by 818,000 between March 2023 and March of this year, Lott said. Lott authored an article on the data for Real Clear Investigations this week, which argued the updates to 2022 stats open the door to questioning if the 2023 stats showing an estimated 3% drop in violent crimes compared to 2022 are legitimate. ""Without the increase, the drop in violent crime in 2023 would have been less than half as large — only 1.6% instead of the reported drop of 3.5%,"" Lott wrote.While FBI data has shown alleged drops in violent crimes in recent years, other government data sets have shown crime has increased in the last few years. Crimes such as rape or sexual assault, aggravated assault and robbery increased from 2020 to 2023, the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed last month as part of its National Crime Victimization Survey. Across the board, the survey found total instances of reported violent crimes increased from 5.6 per 1,000 individuals aged 12 and over in 2020, when Trump was still in office, to 8.7 per 1,000 in 2023. Lott, who also served as a senior adviser for research and statistics at the DOJ’s Office of Justice Programs, authored an op-ed for Real Clear Politics last month and detailed that the DOJ survey found that total violent crimes are 55.4% higher in 2023 than in 2020, the end of Trump's tenure, while rape crimes increased by 42%, robbery by 63% and aggravated assault by 55%. The DOJ survey does not include surveys on murder, but that category is almost always reported to police departments, and subsequently to the FBI, he noted, and makes up about 1% of the U.S.' total violent crimes.Fox News Digital reached out to the FBI and Harris campaign regarding the 2022 data but did not immediately receive replies. The FBI said in comment to Fox News later Wednesday evening that it stands by ""each of our Crime in the Nation publications.""""In 2022, the estimated violent crime rate decreased 1.7 percent from 2021. The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program transitioned from the traditional Summary Reporting System (SRS) to the more comprehensive National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for the 2021 data collection year. A significant number of agencies were unable to complete the transition to NIBRS in 2021. Due to the lower volume of participation, the FBI was unable to produce the traditional national estimates for 2021. To provide a confident comparison of crime trends across the nation, the UCR Program performed a NIBRS estimation crime trend analysis. The analysis used NIBRS estimation data of violent and property crimes from 2020 and 2021. In 2022, the FBI resumed collecting SRS data in addition to NIBRS to present nationally representative data. In order to compile reliable estimates for the yearly trend, the FBI used a statistical sampling of 2021 data to augment the 2021 information collected via NIBRS for the 2022 publication.""The agency continued that the release of Crime in the Nation, 2023, last month ""was the first phase in the FBI’s efforts to provide the public with more timely data."""" The next phase will see a shift to monthly data releases to promote transparency and provide an opportunity for consumers to review data based on more timely crime counts with the understanding that data will be continuously updated.  As part of this movement, the FBI has moved towards automation, allowing for past years’ estimates to be updated as data are submitted. Therefore, 2021 counts now showing in the 20-year estimation tables reflect only estimates based on the data directly reported to the FBI.  This explains why the figure appears different than the computed estimation published in the Crime in the Nation, 2022,"" the agency continued.

The 2024 election cycle is drawing to a close –? here's what we know,"There was some shock at the outcome of last week’s election.But when it comes to control of the House and Senate, things generally landed in the range anticipated by many learned observers.There was a high probability of a Republican Senate – with the GOP likely having a seat or two to cushion a majority.The House of Representatives was expected to be close. The forecast was that the House breakdown would probably reflect the split between the majority and minority today. The only question was which party would be in the majority. And there was a high likelihood that control of the House would mirror the outcome of the Presidential election.You know the rest.The House is close, likely in Republican hands. When everything is settled, Republicans will likely have between 221-223 seats. The Senate moved to the GOP – with a few pickups.So say what you will about the Presidential election. But very few predictions about the House and Senate were off.In the Senate, the map always favored Republicans. The GOP would probably score an immediate pickup with Sen.-elect Jim Justice, R-W.V., claiming the seat of retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.V., who caucused with the Democrats.Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Jon Tester, D-Mont., were the most-endangered Democrats up this cycle. Both represented states which heavily supported President-elect Trump. But Brown and Tester consistently proved they could win their races in challenging environments. Plus, there was something else going for them: Brown and Tester always appearing on the ballot in Democratic years: 2006, 2012 and 2018.Democrats won the House and Senate in 2006. That was the ""six-year itch"" election for President George W. Bush. The second midterm is often brutal for the party of the president in Congress. Voters returned former President Obama to the White House in 2012. Democrats won the House in 2018.2024? Not a good year for Democrats.In Ohio, it appears that Mr. Trump won the Buckeye State by a staggering 11 points.It was always believed that Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, would run behind Mr. Trump and that the President-elect needed to carry Ohio by about 10 points to unseat Brown. Moreno wound up toppling Brown by four points.Sen.-elect Dave McCormick, R-Penn., appears to have unseated Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn. The underperformance of Vice President Harris in the Keystone State really harmed Democrats like Casey. Harris lost Pennsylvania by about two points. Something else about Casey? Like Brown and Tester, he was on the same election cycle: 2006, 2012, 2018 and 2024. Democrats would have a fighting chance at flipping the House had they performed better in Pennsylvania. They failed to unseat former Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Scott Perry, R-Penn. Meantime, GOP challengers defeated Reps. Susan Wild, D-Penn., and Matt Cartwright, D-Penn. Democrats needed to knock off Perry and hold those seats to claim the House.Despite being in the same boat as Brown, Tester and Casey, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., prevailed in a battleground state captured by Mr. Trump. Rep. and Sen.-elect Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., also won in a state carried by the incoming President.In the House, Democrats clung to several key seats they needed in order to flip the House. Rep.-elect Eugene Vindman, D-Va., defeated Republican Derrick Anderson in central Virginia. Reps. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio is on track to hold her seat. And Emilia Sykes, D-Ohio, won – despite Brown’s loss and the blowout of the President-elect.Freshman Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M, won re-election, vanquishing former Rep. Yvette Herrell, R-N.M., in what has been the swingiest district in the country. Vasquez’s district in southern New Mexico has toggled between the parties in each election since 2016. Democrat Janelle Bynum is leading Rep. Lori Chavez-Deremer, R-Ore. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., topped Republican Joe Kent. Gluesenkamp Perez was the surprise winner of all House races in 2022.During an interview with colleague Bret Baier, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., cited how moderates like Gluesenkamp Perez ran campaigns to fit their districts and scored reelection.""In Marie’s case, she was criticized by the Washington state Democratic party for some of her votes and some of the positions she has taken. They threatened her with a primary. And then she went out there and won in a Trump plus-six district,"" said Smith.Smith added that fellow Democrats ""should learn a lot from"" the likes of Gluesenkamp Perez, Reps. Don Davis, D-N.C., Pat Ryan, D-N.Y. and Vasquez.In other words, Democrats seemed to do many of the things necessary to gain control of the House.But not enough.Take California.It was thought that Vice President Harris atop of the ticket could help Democrats flip five or six seats in the Golden State alone. Harris is the state’s former Attorney General and U.S. senator.No dice.Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., prevailed in her race. Reps. David Valadao, R-Calif., Ken Calvert, R-Calif., Michelle Steel, R-Calif., and John Duarte, R-Calif., are all poised to hold their seats. Things remain close between Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., and Democratic challenger George Whitesides. The same with Democrat Dave Min and Republican Scott Baugh in the state’s 47th Congressional district. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., vacated that seat in her unsuccessful quest for the Senate.""These are areas that have been Democrat strongholds, and we're within that fraction of a percentage of taking two more. So the voter shift was significant in a deep blue state. Let's not kid ourselves. We are a deep blue state. But the shift is significant,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., on Fox Business.The current breakdown in the House is as follows:432 members. 220 Republicans, 212 Democrats. There are three vacancies: Late Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Tex., and Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., died. Former Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc. resigned. These seats are partisan districts. So in reality with 435 members, the breakdown should probably be 221 Republicans and 214 Democrats.When all is said and done, campaigns will have exhausted several billion dollars on House races. And the results: likely the same as where things stand now. A probable Republican majority within a seat or two of the present breakdown.Let’s say just for the sake of argument it is 221 Republicans to 214 Democrats. With a margin of seven votes, Republicans can only lose three votes on their side before needing help from Democrats to pass bills. That is precisely the same problem which bedeviled the Republican majority for the past two years. It’s a problem to pass anything with more than a few defectors – or if one or two Republicans are absent. As I always say, you try to get 435 people in the same room at the same time.For Republicans, a solid victory by President-elect Trump will likely impose party discipline for many of his legislative initiatives. But what happens when the GOP tries to advance tax reform – and budget hawks balk because it explodes the deficit? Or if New York Republicans demand a restoration of the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT?Republicans likely have 53 seats in the Senate. But that’s a far cry from 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. And while 53 is a lot better than the 51 Democrats had in this Congress, don’t forget that Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, sometimes bucked the Trump Administration the last time.These are the possible headaches which could hinder the GOP when it comes to governing. Republicans are more aligned now than they were when President-elect Trump entered office in 2017. But it’s always about the math on Capitol Hill. And the parliamentary algebra presents some challenging equations that Republicans must solve to implement their policies in the 119th Congress.",10-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2024-election-cycle-drawing-close-e281a0-heres-what-we-know
Trump-backed PA Senate candidate flips longtime Dem seat red in nail-biter election,"Republican Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick was declared victorious in his high-stakes election against longtime Democrat Sen. Bob Casey on Tuesday. Casey's campaign released a statement Thursday afternoon saying he would not concede until all votes are counted. ""As the Pennsylvania Secretary of State said this afternoon, there are tens of thousands of ballots across the Commonwealth still to count, which includes provisional ballots, military and overseas ballots, and mail ballots,"" Maddy McDaniel, a spokesperson for Casey's campaign, said in a statement. ""This race is within half a point and cannot be called while the votes of thousands of Pennsylvanians are still being counted. We will make sure every Pennsylvanian’s voice is heard.""As of Thursday afternoon, The Associated Press was reporting McCormick with 3,340,649, or 49.0% of the vote, and Casey with 3,308,961, or 48.5% of the vote. Casey has served in the Senate since 2008 and ultimately became a stalwart within the Democratic Party. For example, he voted on legislation President Biden supported 98.5% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight data.  The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator’s father, serving as the Keystone State’s governor from 1987 to 1995 after years of serving in various other elected roles.The longtime senator, however, faced what was described as his most difficult re-election effort to date, squaring up against Republican businessman Dave McCormick. McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates who served as the undersecretary of commerce for industry and security as well as undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs in former President George W. Bush’s administration.Political eyes have been locked on Pennsylvania this election cycle after it yet again emerged as a key battleground state for the presidential race. Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.The race was rated as ""leans Democrat"" by both the Fox News Power Rankings and the Cook Political Report, with Casey himself acknowledging this year that it would be a ""close, tough race.""Biden campaigned for Casey in their shared home state, with the president lauding the senator as ""a man that kids can look up to."" On the other side of the aisle, McCormick earned Trump’s endorsement. ""He’s a good man. He wants to run a good ship,"" Trump said during a rally in April. ""He’s a smart guy. He was a very successful guy. He’s given up a lot to do this.""The two have sparred over issues such as immigration, abortion, spiraling inflation and law enforcement in their campaigns and during their debates.Casey campaigned on a platform of protecting access to abortion, lowering ""greedflation"" and preserving Pennsylvania’s ""energy legacy"" while also working ""to protect our environment"" and bolstering infrastructure in rural areas.McCormick campaigned on reeling in inflation under the Biden-Harris administration, securing the border, curbing crime, defending the Second Amendment and expanding the Keystone State’s energy sector.The high-stakes election put both candidates under the national spotlight, including earlier this year when police leaders in the state slammed Casey for aligning himself with a pro-defund the police group as he geared up for the election. He was also dinged by McCormick and other conservatives for rhetoric blaming spiraling inflation on corporations’ alleged greed, which he calls ""greedflation."" McCormick came under fire from Casey and Democrats for splitting his time between Pennsylvania and Connecticut, where his children attend school, painting him as a Keystone State outsider.",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-backed-pa-senate-candidate-flips-longtime-dem-seat-red-nail-biter-election
Behind-the-scenes battles: Legal challenges that could impact the vote before Election Day begins,"Battleground states have already seen their share of fights before Election Day as legal challenges centered on voting issues, and while some have already been decided, others remain up in the air just hours before polls open Tuesday morning.From issues including mail-in ballots, drop boxes and concerns about ineligible voters, here are some of the high-profile swing state cases and where they currently stand.ArizonaArizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes acknowledged in September that 218,000 people in the state were allowed to register to vote without proof of citizenship despite state law that requires it. A state court set a deadline of Monday for production of a full list of affected people so that the recorders of each county can verify the citizenship of voters who had not previously provided proof of citizenship.The Maricopa County Recorder’s Office said in a statement to Fox News Digital on Monday before receiving any list that approximately 2,000 people had tried to submit voter registration updates and subsequently received notices that they had to prove their citizenship.""These voters were contacted individually to let them know their registration was incomplete. However, after further consideration, the decision was made to fully restore those voters from the not-registered status, only if they were previously an existing, registered voter,"" the statement said. GeorgiaGeorgia has seen multiple lawsuits involving mail-in ballots. In Cobb County, the ACLU sued, claiming that at least 3,000 voters did not receive their ballots on time. A lower court had ordered new ballots to be sent overnight to the affected voters, saying that their votes would be counted as long as they are received by Nov. 8 at 5 p.m., but the Georgia Supreme Court stayed that ruling on Monday, so these voters now have to make sure their ballots get to the county elections office by 7pm on Election Day or vote in person.Also in Cobb County, as well as in Fulton, Dekalb and Gwinnett Counties, the Republican National Committee sued, claiming that election offices improperly opened over the weekend to allow voters to drop off their mail-in ballots in person. The RNC cited state law that says drop boxes should be closed after the end of the early voting period, which was Friday. A state court said the county elections offices had the discretion to open for additional hours.Another Georgia case involved Fulton County’s offices being open over the weekend for dropping off mail-in ballots. At first, poll observers were barred from entering, with Fulton County elections director Nadine Williams stating that they were not allowed because it was a county office and not a polling site. Just hours later, it was announced that observers would be permitted after all.NevadaA lawsuit from the Trump campaign, RNC and Nevada Republican Party opposing the potential counting of mail-in ballots that the state receives after Election Day that do not bear a postmark. The state Supreme Court ruled that such ballots can still be counted up to three days after Election Day. There is a similar case in federal court where challengers also lost but are appealing to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.The same issue was also brought before the Fifth Circuit after a case was brought in Mississippi, and while the court said such ballots cannot be counted after Election Day, the ruling does not apply to this year’s election.North CarolinaThe RNC also has a lawsuit in North Carolina, involving 225,000 people it alleges are improperly registered because they had used an old form that did not ask for their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. The RNC claims that this violates the Help America Vote Act (HAVA).""Because of these errors, the North Carolina voter rolls, which both HAVA and state law mandates that Defendants regularly maintain, are potentially replete with ineligible voters – including possible non-citizens – all of whom are now registered to vote,"" the RNC and North Carolina GOP said in a court filing.PennsylvaniaThe Keystone State remains a key battleground, not just on the ballot but in courtrooms, with several lawsuits having been filed over a variety of voting issues, many involving mail-in ballots.Republicans scored a win when they appealed a court ruling that said mail-in ballots without a required handwritten date could still be counted. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court overruled, saying that handwritten dates must be on the ballots.The GOP was not so fortunate in a separate case in which it sought an emergency appeal from the U.S. Supreme Court after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that provisional ballots should be counted if voters’ mail-in ballots were disqualified for technical errors, such as not being in mandatory secrecy envelopes. Republicans cited a state law that they argued prohibited voters from casting provisional ballots if they had already submitted mail-in ballots on time.The U.S. Supreme Court turned away the RNC’s appeal, with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas issuing a statement that made clear that because the case only involved two votes in a small county, it would not have impacted the results of the election either way.Both parties won legal challenges when voters in multiple counties did not receive mail-in ballots on time. Democrats in Erie County sued when as many as 20,000 voters did not receive their ballots from a third-party vendor on time. A judge ruled that the Erie County Board of Elections had to remain open last Friday and Saturday so voters could fill out ballots.In Bucks County, Republicans sued over voters waiting in line for mail-in ballots being turned away at 5 p.m., even though they had been there waiting. A judge swiftly ruled that voters should get an additional three days to apply for a mail-in ballot.Another Pennsylvania case involves six Republican members of Congress who sued Pennsylvania’s State Department with allegations that overseas voters’ ballots were vulnerable to fraud because those voters were not made to adhere to the same identification requirement as absentee ballot voters in the U.S. The GOP lawmakers lost when a judge dismissed their case based on standing, timeliness, not presenting a viable cause of action and failing to join indispensable parties.One situation that remains ongoing involves a potential voter fraud operation that is under investigation. Officials have said that several counties have seen large batches of voter registration forms and mail-in ballot applications that were suspicious. In Monroe County, District Attorney Mike Mancuso said that some of the forms detected in his county were submitted by ""Field and Media Corps,"" an apparent subsidiary of Fieldcorp, an Arizona-based organization working in Lancaster County.This was after officials in Lancaster County reported receiving 2,500 forms marked as suspicious for having false names, duplicative handwriting or unverifiable or incorrect identifying information.The applications reportedly were not limited to a single party and were collected in various spots across the county.One more case in Pennsylvania involves Elon Musk and his contest to award $1 million each day to an individual who registers to vote and signs a pledge to support the First and Second amendments. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner sued Musk and his PAC, claiming that the contest is an illegal lottery, and the Justice Department warned the Tesla CEO that there could be federal law issues because it is illegal to pay people to vote.Musk has countered that he is not requiring anyone to vote in order to win the prize, only to register and sign the petition. He attempted to have the case moved to federal court but was unsuccessful. A hearing in the case took place on Monday, and a judge ruled that Musk could continue his contest through Election Day.WisconsinOn Monday, the RNC announced that it is suing the Milwaukee Elections Commission over a city plan that was announced over the weekend, which says some precincts will limit poll watchers on Election Day to just one Democrat and one Republican, with outside organizations being barred.",4-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/behind-scenes-battles-legal-challenges-could-impact-vote-before-election-day-begins
"'All the options' are on the table to get Trump's Cabinet picks through confirmation, says Sen. John Thune","Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune said ""all the options"" are on the table to get President-elect Trump’s Cabinet picks through the confirmation process amid concern some appointees won’t receive enough votes to be confirmed.Trump in recent days announced his choices for key government positions, from Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence to Matt Gaetz as attorney general and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary.Thune, R-S.D., told Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier Thursday on ""Special Report"" that Senate Republicans are going to work with Trump to ""see that he gets his team installed as quickly as possible so he can implement his agenda.""""All these people have a process that they have to go through. All these nominees are – it's a – you know, advice and consent. That's the Senate's constitutional role when it comes to confirmation of nominations to the executive branch of the government. And we take that role seriously,"" he said. ""But we also are not going to allow the Democrats to obstruct or block President Trump and the will of the American people.""Republicans and Democrats from both sides of the political aisle expressed their shock at Trump’s choice of Gaetz as attorney general. The former Florida congressman reportedly resigned from Congress days before the House Ethics Committee was set to hold a meeting on its investigation into allegations he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz denies the allegations.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told reporters she didn't think Trump’s AG choice was a ""serious nomination."" ""We need to have a serious attorney general and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious. This one was not on my bingo card,"" she said.Thune was asked about using ""recess appointments"" to get Trump’s picks through Senate confirmation if there aren't enough votes for the nominee to get confirmed. ""Recess appointments,"" according to the Associated Press, allow a president to fill vacancies while the Senate is out or in recess. ""Well, it's an option, but obviously, it takes, you know, you have to have all Republicans vote to recess as well. So the same Republicans that you mentioned that might have a problem voting for somebody under regular order probably also have a problem voting to put the Senate into recess,"" the Southa Dakota native noted. ""You have to have concurrence from the House. There's a process. All this is a process. But I don't think any of those things are necessarily off the table.""""I think we have to have all the options on the table. And these nominees deserve their day in court. They deserve a hearing, a confirmation hearing, an opportunity to be vetted. And the Senate will perform its constitutional role under advice and consent. But we are not going to allow the Democrats to thwart the will of the American people in giving President Trump the people that he wants in those positions to implement his agenda,"" Thune continued.He added that the confirmation process for some of the nominees isn’t going to be easy but the American people gave Trump a ""mandate"" for change with his Electoral College and popular vote wins.""The people in this country want change. He [Trump] wants to bring that about. And I always believe that you defer to a president when it comes to the people they want in their cabinet,"" Thune said.""But obviously, there is a process whereby we get down and scrub all these nominees and figure out whether or not, one, they're qualified and are they people who are fit to hold these offices.""",14-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/all-options-table-get-trumps-cabinet-picks-through-confirmation-says-sen-john-thune
FEMA official directed hurricane relief workers to avoid homes with Trump signs as agency conducts cleanup,"A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) official has been removed from a role after directing disaster relief workers to skip homes ""advertising"" support for President-elect Trump after the devastating hurricanes in Florida.In a statement to Fox News Digital, a FEMA spokesperson said the agency is ""deeply disturbed"" after the incident,"" noting the official who gave the instruction ""was given no direction to tell teams to avoid these homes.""""While we believe this is an isolated incident, we have taken measures to remove the employee from their role and are investigating the matter to prevent this from happening ever again,"" the spokesperson said. ""The employee who issued this guidance had no authority and was given no direction to tell teams to avoid these homes, and we are reaching out to the people who may have not been reached as a result of this incident.""The Daily Wire first obtained internal messages about the incident.In messages obtained by the outlet, a FEMA official instructs workers to ""avoid homes advertising Trump.""The outlet noted the aid workers would enter into a system tracking applications that they made no contact with the residents, blaming the directive — ""Trump sign, no contact per leadership.""The agency said it is investigating the incident and is taking it ""extremely seriously.""FEMA noted after hurricanes Helene and Milton the agency has helped over 365,000 households and provided over $898 million in direct assistance.""We are horrified that this took place and therefore have taken extreme actions to correct this situation and have ensured that the matter was addressed at all levels,"" the agency said. ""Helping people is what we do best, and our workforce across the agency will continue to serve survivors for as long as it takes.""In a statement on X, the U.S. House Oversight Committee and Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said the person responsible for sending out guidance to employees has not been fired.""FEMA hasn’t fired this person. . . . But the IRS has been trying to force IRS whistleblower Gary Shapley out for blowing the whistle! We must hold these unelected bureaucrats accountable,"" Comer wrote on X.""FEMA admits this happened but doesn’t say if the bureaucrat responsible has been fired,"" the House Oversight Committee wrote on X. ""Democrats relentlessly defend the rules that insulate unelected bureaucrats from accountability and make it nearly impossible to fire bad employees. This is why we need President Trump’s reforms to make bureaucrats accountable.""In a statement on X, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that his administration is launching an investigation into FEMA.""The blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days,"" DeSantis said. ""At my direction, the Division of Emergency Management is launching an investigation into the federal government's targeted discrimination of Floridians who support Donald Trump.""New leadership is on the way to D.C., and I'm optimistic that these partisan bureaucrats will be fired.""The discovery of mismanagement came after the Biden administration lectured people about spreading ""disinformation"" about FEMA.

"Trump expected to choose South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for Homeland Security secretary, source says","President-elect Donald Trump is expected to select South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to fill the role of Homeland Security secretary, multiple sources confirm to Fox News Digital.Noem, who was thought to be a potential running mate on the Trump ticket earlier in the year, has served as governor of the Mount Rushmore State since 2019.The Department of Homeland Security oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).If selected, Noem would work with Tom Homan, who was announced as Trump's ""border czar"" on Sunday, and Stephen Miller, who was announced as the White House deputy of staff for policy on Monday.Noem, along with Homan and Miller, has long been a supporter of Trump's hardline stance on immigration and border security. As governor, Noem has dispatched troops from the South Dakota National Guard multiple times to serve along the U.S. southern border with Mexico.""I was the very first governor that when Texas and Arizona asked for help, I sent my National Guard troops down there to help,"" Noem touted at her CPAC Dallas speech in the summer of 2021.Fox News also confirmed on Monday night that the president-elect is expected to choose Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida as Secretary of State.An official announcement from Trump's transition team on either Rubio or Noem had not been made as of Tuesday morning.Noem, who served eight years as South Dakota's at-large congresswoman before winning election as governor in 2018, has long been a strong Trump supporter and ally.And the governor, who speaks regularly with Trump according to those in her political orbit, was a high-profile surrogate on behalf of the former president on the campaign trail this year.In an interview last week on Fox News' ""Your World,"" Noem told host Neil Cavuto that Trump ""has told me several times now, a couple of times just since Election Day, about how focused he is on doing big things…he knows he only has four years and he wants to hit the ground running. And he said anybody that I want around me needs to be thinking big, too.""Noem, who was convincingly re-elected in 2022, is term-limited and has two years left in office as South Dakota governor.The news of Trump's selection of Noem to serve at Homeland Security was first reported by CNN.

Kamala Harris' bungled answer on 'The View' about Biden seen as turning point in campaign,"Vice President Kamala Harris did not go to ""The View"" expecting a tough interrogation when she sat down with the ABC talk show on Oct. 8.But her answer to a softball question is now widely viewed as a turning point in a campaign that ended in her lopsided defeat at the hands of President-elect Donald Trump.Co-host Sunny Hostin asked Harris, ""If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?"" Harris paused for a moment and then said, ""There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of — and I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.""Hostin had given Harris a clear opportunity to differentiate herself from Biden, who dropped out of the race in July due to intense party pressure and grim polls. But Harris instead effectively cut an ad for Trump's campaign that allowed it to tie her directly to an unpopular administration.In a New York Times report about how Trump won the race, this moment was seen as significant because the Trump campaign's internal polling showed Harris had, until that point, effectively pitched herself as a change agent to voters.The Times reported Trump advisers ""rejoiced"" and were shocked Harris didn't have an answer ready for such an obvious question. The clip soon found its way into national advertisements.""By that afternoon, up to 10 million voters received text messages containing the clip on their cellphones. Television ads broadcast it to tens of millions more over the following weeks,"" the Times reported.Facing the headwinds of Biden's unpopularity, widespread economic anxiety and a multicultural voting coalition built by Trump, Harris went down to defeat on Tuesday, and many of her supporters are blaming Biden. If numbers stand, Harris will be the first Democrat to lose the national popular vote in 20 years and only the second since 1988.Hostin certainly didn't want to hurt Harris. She predicted the Democrat would win the race in a ""blowout"" and confidently said that Puerto Ricans would take out ""trash"" like Trump last week after an insult comic's joke about the island at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally in New York.The rest of the left-leaning show's hosts openly supported Harris in the race as well. Co-host Whoopi Goldberg even introduced Harris as ""the next President of the United States"" on the day of her interview.But Hostin's innocent query helped derail Harris, and numerous media reports are highlighting it in their postmortems about Harris' bruising defeat.The ""View"" anecdote leads a CNN story headlined, ""Where Harris' campaign went wrong,"" as well as BBC's ""Why Kamala Harris lost: A flawed candidate or doomed campaign?"" and USA Today's ""How Kamala Harris lost the election: The fatal flaws in a doomed election bid.""""Kamala Harris Lost Her Way After ‘The View’ Interview Left Her Campaign Stranded With Joe Biden,"" a Variety headline on Wednesday blares. Mediaite included it in its list of the five moments that made Trump president again.""Americans were ready for a change, and Harris kept telling them that she represented one on the stump. But the hollowness of that promise was laid bare when, in a moment of weakness, she admitted that she couldn’t identify a single substantive difference between herself and her boss,"" Mediaite wrote.Hostin was one of several hosts of the show fuming at Tuesday's results this week. On Wednesday, she said Trump's victory was due to ""cultural resentment"" in the country and called herself ""profoundly disturbed"" at the results.On Thursday, she snapped that Latinos in Texas supporting Trump were sexists and misogynists.",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-bungled-answer-the-view-about-biden-seen-turning-point-campaign
Biden imposes a new methane emissions tax as he prepares to leave the White House,"President Biden's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a new rule Tuesday, taxing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector.The new tax was born out of Biden's sweeping climate legislation passed by Congress, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a Waste Emissions Charge provision. Although the waste emissions charge was mandated by Congress, the Biden administration had discretion on how tightly to clamp down. The fee will start at $900 per metric ton of methane emitted over a specific performance level during 2024. In subsequent years, the fee will increase. In 2025, it will grow to $1,200 per metric ton. In 2026, it will increase to $1,500 per ton. Meanwhile, each subsequent year after that, the fee will continue to rise, according to the EPA.""The final Waste Emissions Charge is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden’s methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air, and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a press release.Prior to Tuesday's new methane emissions rule, Biden and his administration imposed other rules aimed at clamping down on methane. Shortly after taking office in 2021, he signed a law repealing a Trump-era action that rescinded stricter methane-emissions standards imposed under then-President Obama. While climate change advocates, such as the Clean Air Task Force, have praised Biden's rule regulating methane emissions, Steve Milloy, a fellow at the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute, described the action as ""irrelevant."" Milloy said that because upwards of 95% or more of the greenhouse gasses trapped by the earth's atmosphere are water vapor and carbon dioxide, little to no room remains for methane to be stored.Milloy also suggested the new methane emissions rule will likely be ineffective, considering it targets the oil and gas sector but not the agricultural sector as well. ""The largest source of methane is actually microbes,"" Milloy pointed out — as opposed to man-made power plants. Microbes are tiny organisms that live in cow's stomachs, agricultural fields and wetlands, according to The Washington Post.In addition to the effectiveness, Milloy pointed out that the tax will also be to the benefit of Big Oil companies, while hurting smaller ones. ""It's because all these regulations cripple the competition,"" Milloy said. ""Taxing the oil industry, you know, Big Oil is going to be all for that.""Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., who was endorsed by Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions during his bid for re-election this year, echoed that going after the oil and gas industry with this latest tax will serve to ""raise costs and prevent investment.""""Thankfully, this insanity will end in January,"" Murphy said.     President-elect Trump has suggested he would repeal many of the green energy initiatives implanted within Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.This week, the new president-elect nominated former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin to be his next EPA chief. Meanwhile, Republican Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has been floated as a possibility for Trump's next energy secretary, among others.Fox News Digital reached out to the White House and EPA for comment but did not receive an on-the-record response, but the White House did point to a fact sheet it released Tuesday on how the Biden-Harris administration has ""leverage[d] historic U.S. climate leadership at home and abroad.""",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-imposes-new-methane-emissions-tax-way-out-white-house-critic-says-boost-big-oil
"On Election Eve, Harris and Trump hold dueling rallies in the biggest of the battlegrounds","Vice President Kamala Harris is making a last-minute pitch to her supporters in the biggest of the battlegrounds.""We need you to vote, Pennsylvania.  We need you to vote,"" Harris emphasized as she spoke to a large crowd in the Keystone State's capital city of Harrisburg last week. ""No one can sit on the sidelines.""The vice president and Democratic presidential nominee returns to Pennsylvania on Monday - holding rallies in Allentown, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Election Eve. She'll begin her final day with a canvass kick off in Scranton, and also make a stop in Reading.Her rival for the White House, Republican nominee former President Donald Trump, held a rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday. ""A very, very special hello to Pennsylvania… What a great place. And I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots,"" the former president told the crowd at his rally in Lititz. Trump's message to his supporters: ""Pennsylvania, go vote.""On Monday, the final full day of campaigning ahead of Election Day, Trump returns to the state to hold rallies in Reading and Pittsburgh.It is no surprise that both major party nominees are heavily concentrating their final campaign schedules in Pennsylvania.With 19 electoral votes up for grabs, it is the biggest prize among the seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump and are likely to determine if Trump or Harris succeeds Biden in the White House.""Pennsylvania is the one state that it's hard to see someone losing and then still winning the presidential race,"" Mark Harris, a Pittsburgh-based longtime Republican national strategist and ad maker, told Fox News. ""It's clearly ground zero.""Harris, a veteran of multiple GOP presidential campaigns, called Pennsylvania ""a big tipping point state."" Pointing to the state's major cities - Philadelphia and Pittsburgh - its electorally crucial suburban areas, and its vast swath of rural counties, Harris highlighted, ""I think it's a good microcosm of America.""The former president, the current vice president and their running mates - GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance and his Democratic counterpart - Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz - as well as top surrogates, have repeatedly stopped in the state this summer and autumn.While the campaigns and their allied super PACs have poured resources into all seven battlegrounds, more money has been spent on running spots in Pennsylvania than any of the other swing states, according to figures from AdImpact, a top national ad tracking firm.Pennsylvania, along with Michigan and Wisconsin, are the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called ""Blue Wall.""The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.Four years later, in 2020, Biden carried all three states by razor-thin margins to put them back in the Democrats' column and defeated Trump.A New York Times/Siena College poll in Pennsylvania last Tuesday through Saturday and released on Sunday indicated Harris and Trump deadlocked at 48% among likely voters in the state. It was the latest survey to indicate a tied or margin-of-error race. Senior Harris campaign officials, taking questions from reporters on Sunday evening, noted that roughly three-quarters of Keystone State voters will cast ballots on Tuesday ""because unlike other states, the guidelines, and availability of early voting is just more limited in Pennsylvania.""However, they added that when it comes to the early vote in the state, ""we really like what we're seeing.""They predicted that ""we expect in Pennsylvania, we'll have a very strong Election Day.""However, Pennsylvania is also the state where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July - two days before the start of the Republican National Convention. Additionally, the former president returned to the site in Butler - in the western part of the state - for a massive rally last month.Ahead of his two rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump kicks off his Monday campaign schedule in North Carolina, where he will hold his fourth rally since Saturday, which has raised eyebrows among political operatives.""We've had a lot of luck in North Carolina. We won it twice,"" Trump said Sunday in Kinston. ""We are going to win North Carolina.""A day earlier, at another North Carolina rally, he warned his supporters that ""when you’re winning by a lot, you can still lose by a little.""Polls indicate a margin-of-error race in North Carolina, the only one of the seven key battlegrounds that Trump narrowly carried over Biden four years ago. A source in the former president's political orbit confided to Fox News that there were concerns of a possible setback in the Tar Heel state.While Harris closes out her campaign with a late night rally in Philadelphia, Trump will be in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for his final rally. For Trump, it is tradition. He closed out his 2016 and 2020 campaigns in the southwestern Michigan city.Trump, as he has in recent days, on Sunday once again argued without providing proof that the Democrats were trying to cheat.""They are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing,"" the former president charged at his Pennsylvania rally.Later, at his rally in North Carolina, he also reiterated his claim that ""we have a big lead. We have a big lead. The fake news, they don't tell you this. We have a big, beautiful lead.""Responding, Harris told reporters on Sunday that ""I would ask in particular people who have not yet voted to not fall for his tactic, which I think includes suggesting to people that if they vote, their vote won't matter. Suggesting to people that somehow the integrity of our voting system is not intact so that they don't vote.""""It is meant to distract from the fact that we have and support free and fair elections in our country,"" Harris argued. ""We did in 2020. He lost.""The Harris campaign on Sunday night also touted its very formidable get-out-the-vote operation, highlighting that it had more than 90,000 volunteers over the weekend helping to turn out voters, and that they knocked on more than three million doors in the key battlegrounds.",4-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/election-eve-harris-trump-hold-dueling-rallies-biggest-battlegrounds
Pentagon denies false claim that Biden-Harris admin authorized troops to use force against Americans,"The Pentagon released an unusual statement Thursday debunking a rumor spread online that falsely claims U.S. troops are authorized to use force against American citizens during the election. Former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others have spread inaccurate information that suggests a Defense Department policy revision in late September was timed to interfere with the Nov. 5 presidential election. ""... Biden/Harris have just pushed through DoD Directive 5240.01 giving the Pentagon power -- for the first time in history -- to use lethal force to kill Americans on U.S. soil who protest government policies,"" Kennedy posted on X to his 4 million followers. U.S. law prohibits federal troops on American soil from using force against U.S. civilians, except in cases of self-defense as outlined in the Posse Comitatus Act.The cited revision, Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 5240.01, does not allow troops to use force on U.S. citizens. The timing of its release was not related to the election, Pentagon spokeswoman Sue Gough told The Associated Press. ""The policies concerning the use of force by DOD addressed in DoDD 5240.01 are not new, and do not authorize the DOD to use lethal force against U.S. citizens or people located inside the United States, contrary to rumors and rhetoric circulating on social media,"" Gough said in a statement. The Pentagon regularly updates its directives. This update, which happened on Sept. 27, was intended to align the language on use of force from other policies into 5240.01, which only applies to defense intelligence personnel. ""Defense Intelligence Components may provide personnel to assist a Federal department or agency, including a Federal law enforcement agency, or a State or local law enforcement agency when lives are in danger, in response to a request for such assistance,"" it says. The directive says the Secretary of Defense must sign off on ""Assistance in responding with assets with potential for lethality, or any situation in which it is reasonably foreseeable that providing the requested assistance may involve the use of force that is likely to result in lethal force, including death or serious bodily injury."" Defense intelligence personnel are permitted to supply intelligence, analysis, training, equipment and weapons to civilian authorities. However, they cannot use force themselves.

White House selects North Carolina family's Christmas tree farm to provide 2024 tree,"With the holiday season fast approaching, the White House is getting ready to deck the halls.The annual tradition of selecting the perfect Christmas tree is held through the National Christmas Tree Contest.This year’s honor was bestowed on Cartner’s Christmas Tree Farm in Newland, North Carolina.Cartner’s Christmas Tree Farm is family-owned and operated; it has grown Fraser firs since 1959.Sam Cartner, owner of Cartner Christmas Tree Farm, told Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview that his farm has competed several times, and that it's honored to be chosen. ""What we're really excited about is the industry and [about] the Fraser fir being recognized as the top Christmas tree in the nation, and we're excited to promote the industry and get recognized for our green product that's totally recyclable – and [it's] good for the environment and good for families,"" he said.Since 1966, members of the National Christmas Tree Association have presented the official White House Christmas Tree for display in the Blue Room.Cartner’s Christmas Tree farm will propose six to eight trees to be selected by four White House officials who will be visiting the farm to select the final one.Sam Cartner said the trees must be about 18-19 feet tall and no wider than 12 feet. ""These are Fraser firs and considered the top Christmas tree species in the nation. Even though it's slow-growing, it pulls its needles long and its color is the green color and has great fragrance. It's indigenous to the western North Carolina counties,"" he said. ""They're slightly acidic and well-drained, and we get a lot of rainfall and snow and have cold weather.""The trees being proposed for the White House took roughly 25 years to grow.The farm is run by brothers David, Jim and Sam, who took over the farm from their father, Sam, who served in World War II.""I think one of the main reasons my dad was a pioneer in this business — he was a cultural extension agent here and promoted Christmas trees [as] a better cash crop here in the mountains where it was hard to grow other crops with such a short growing season,"" Sam Cartner said. ""And it's become such a successful industry for being the second major income producer in these western counties behind tourism.""He said the most important part about picking out a Christmas tree is the experience, and he highly recommends going to a farm where people can choose and cut their own tree.The most important part about picking out a Christmas tree is the experience, he said. ""[Farms] try to make it an experience where the family can enjoy food and drinks and music and photos, storytelling,"" Sam Cartner said. ""That's what I would say is go to someone who's trying to make it the family experience. I'm sure the trees will be fresh because that's what they're striving to do. And look for a tree that's [a] deep green color and has soft needles,"" he added.Jim Cartner advised families to make sure they know where they are going to put the tree in their house before picking one out.""[People] kind of forget that maybe their ceiling is not as tall as the tree is at the field, and they get home and, you know, they end up having to alter the size,"" Jim Cartner said. He added, ""[It] is a tradition that we like to see families develop, and I think they'll have a great time picking trees out.""The farm will have a send-off ""harvest"" on Nov. 20 with a fundraiser benefiting families in western North Carolina that have been devastated by recent flooding.",28-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/white-house-selects-north-carolina-familys-christmas-tree-farm-provide-tree
Trump said to lift all military restrictions on Israel on 1st day in office according to reports,"Amid escalating tensions between Hezbollah and Israel, President-elect Donald Trump has promised to lift all restrictions and delays on the supply of military equipment and ammunition to Israel immediately after his inauguration, Israeli Channel 12 News reports.The assurance from Trump’s team came as Israel is considering a 60-day cease-fire with Hezbollah, which would provide a window until Trump takes office and implements the promised changes.Sources indicate that this commitment from Trump’s administration clarifies Israel’s willingness to temporarily halt military actions, with the understanding that support will resume without delay once Trump is in office.Unnamed Israeli officials have confirmed the reports from Israeli media to Fox News Digital.Currently, U.S. restrictions include an embargo on a certain weapons shipment and limitations on various combat-related equipment, even if they do not involve explosive ordnance. This embargo has impacted Israel’s defense capabilities, especially as the military now contends with active fronts in both Lebanon and Gaza, requiring strict control over ammunition and supply use.This pledge to lift all military supply restrictions, starting from Trump’s first day in office, would allow Israel to replenish its stockpiles and alleviate current constraints. With the 60-day cease-fire, Israel aims to temporarily suspend hostilities until the new administration takes office, enabling a resumption of full military operations if necessary, without the existing limitations.On Thursday, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon submitted a draft truce proposal to Lebanon's Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri to halt fighting between armed group Hezbollah and Israel, two political sources told Reuters, without revealing details.Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is increasing military pressure in Lebanon, operating along the second line of villages to further diminish Hezbollah’s capabilities, alongside airstrikes in Syria and Beirut’s Dahiya district.IDF spokesperson Brigadier General Daniel Hagari commented on the truce negotiations, stating, ""The IDF’s role is to clear out terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon and ensure that Hezbollah cannot threaten Israeli citizens from there. This is our duty, and we must create the conditions that enable the political echelon to take diplomatic action.""Channel 12's chief political analyst, Amit Segal, who first reported the story, told Fox News Digital that ""The Trump administration’s commitment grants Israel greater operational freedom—whether to pursue a cease-fire in Lebanon or, if needed, to take more decisive action with U.S. backing and no restrictions.""Segal added that a cease-fire with Lebanon at this stage signals that Israel’s northern objectives have been met, effectively decoupling the northern and southern fronts. While there may be progress toward calm in the north, he clarified, this development does not extend to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump transition team for comment on the Ch. 12 report but did not get a response.

Depressed media react to Trump victory: How could this possibly have happened?,"Many journalists were clinging to fading hopes that Vice President Kamala Harris could somehow pull out a victory as former President Trump won state after state in the greatest comeback in American political history.By early Wednesday morning, it was clear that the outcome they most dreaded had materialized, and it was not all that close.The Blue Wall crumbled when Trump won Wisconsin, and with it, the vice president’s chances — and already some of her allies in the press are blaming racism and sexism. He wound up, at this writing, with a near-sweep of the battleground states.Harris did the best she could in a shortened campaign, with overwhelmingly favorable and celebrity-fueled media coverage, compared to the constant attacks on her opponent. However, she was the incumbent in a change election.Many of the political geniuses said that Trump — only the second president to regain the White House after losing it — was traveling a dark road, with harsh rhetoric, personal attacks and Arnold Palmer-type distractions. This, they were convinced, would appeal only to his MAGA base and contrasted with Harris’ sunny message of unity and lifting up the middle class.""We’re going to help our country heal,"" Trump said Wednesday morning in West Palm Beach, Florida, a striking contrast with his previous tone.For those left-leaning commentators who said 2024 could be America’s last election if Trump won, the outcome — which included Republicans taking over the Senate — was a slap in the face.Look at these New York Times news headlines:""America Hires a Strongman.""""Pariah, Felon, President-Elect: How Trump Fought His Way Back to Power.""""Four More Years of Unpredictability: The World Prepares for Trump’s Return.""And the editorial page: ""America Makes a Perilous Choice.""When Trump was leading in the Electoral College count last night by 153 to 27, MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace said, ""It could be a very good night for Kamala Harris.""There was a subdued tone on the network on Wednesday morning. On ""Morning Joe,"" Joe Scarborough said, ""America, first of all, is far more to the right than any time in our lifetimes. Even going back to the Reagan years. And Donald Trump won in dominating fashion.""Think of all the ink that was spilled on whether Trump would accept the outcome if he lost and whether there would be violence.As for the dire predictions that a second Trump term would have no guardrails and destroy democracy, well, we’ll find out soon enough whether that was an apocalyptic view.As liberal pundits tried to pick up the pieces of the Democratic wipeout, with one on CNN accusing Trump of having no plan, there was a focus on why Harris did not do better with Black men or Latinos.""America… is far more to the right than any time in our lifetimes."" — MSNBC host Joe ScarboroughTrump projected strength, and even many of those turned off by his pugilistic style had favorable memories of his previous term and its strong economy, despite the trauma of Jan. 6. Harris was saddled with the unpopularity of President Biden, who should have stepped aside much sooner.The theme of one stunned television panel after another today: How could this possibly have happened?But for those who lambasted Trump for not accepting his defeat in 2020 — something he still contested in the final days — it is now their turn to accept that you can’t love your country only when you win.Harris, after hiding from the press for a month and even after winning the debate, just did not have much new to say in the final weeks and often retreated to talking-point responses.I’ve covered Donald Trump for decades, and interviewed him in New York just a couple of weeks ago, when he was very much on his game. He stood by his most controversial stances, such as saying ""the enemy within"" — naming Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff — were more of a threat than Russia or China.The former and future president has promised a mass deportation of illegal immigrants, among other things. However, his most dramatic rhetoric is often brushed aside by most supporters, who believe this is what goes on in campaigns and much of it will never happen.Trump always drives the news agenda by going up to and over the line, forcing the media to cover him, and even negative headlines help him by highlighting his larger points.On CNN, former Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said that ""Democrats need to have a soul-searching moment.""The media could badly use one as well, but I’m not holding my breath.",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/depressed-media-react-trump-victory-how-could-possibly-have-happened

There have been more than 10.8 million illegal encounters since FY 2021.Trump vowed during his campaign he would once again take a hard-line approach to securing the border.""It’s going to be a well-targeted, planned operation conducted by the men of ICE. The men and women of ICE do this daily. They’re good at it,"" Homan said during a Fox News interview on Sunday, adding that deportations would be a ""humane operation.""Trump during his campaign referenced illegal migrants as people fleeing countries that didn’t want them. He often said at his rallies that illegal immigrants flooded the U.S. with drugs and gangs, and that they became a hub for smuggling and human trafficking, saying they are ""poisoning the blood of our country.""""They’re rough people, in many cases from jails, prisons, from mental institutions, insane asylums,"" Trump said. ""You know, insane asylums, that’s ‘Silence of the Lambs’ stuff.""This is only the beginning of thousands of positions that need to be filled by his presidency.

""Karoline Leavitt did a phenomenal job as the National Press Secretary on my Historic Campaign, and I am pleased to announce she will serve as White House Press Secretary,"" Trump said in a statement Friday evening. ""Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator. I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.""Leavitt, 27, will be the youngest White House press secretary in U.S. history, unseating Nixon administration press secretary Ron Ziegler, who was 29 when he served in the role from 1969-1974.""Thank you, President Trump, for believing in me. I am humbled and honored. Let's MAGA!"" Leavitt wrote in a post on X on Friday night.Leavitt served as the campaign's national press secretary, rallying support for Trump while also working as his fierce defender amid political attacks from the Harris campaign and Democrats. ""They forced him to take a mug shot. They tried to remove his name off of the ballot. They forced him to sit in a dirty courthouse for six weeks. Two people tried to kill him, for goodness sake,"" Leavitt said last week on ""Fox & Friends"" following the election. ""And the American people see, in Donald Trump, is clear a leader who even in the darkest of times is going to lift his fist in the air and say, ‘fight, fight, fight’ for this country."" ""Democracy appeared to be the number one issue for voters. It's clear that the American people believe President Trump is the best candidate to preserve our democracy. And it shows the Democrats' message in these final weeks of the campaign that he's this alleged threat to democracy just didn't work in the eyes of the American people,"" she added. Leavitt previously served in Trump's first administration as assistant press secretary during Kayleigh McEnany's tenure. In 2022, the New Hampshire native launched a congressional campaign to represent the state's 1st Congressional District, winning the primary but not the general election. Speculation had mounted that Trump would likely name Leavitt for the role, while other names were also floated, such as Trump’s legal spokeswoman and adviser Alina Habba, President George W. Bush aide and CNN contributor Scott Jennings, longtime Trump adviser and ally Jason Miller, or campaign spokesman and adviser Steven Cheung. Trump named Cheung communications director earlier Friday. Other names floated as potential contenders included former ESPN host Sage Steele, RNC spokeswoman Elizabeth Pipko and former Trump administration official Monica Crowley.In 2016, Trump announced Sean Spicer as his first press secretary, who served in the position from Jan. 20, 2017, to July of that year. Trump's first administration also saw Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who currently serves as governor of Arkansas, Stephanie Grisham and McEnany. Trump’s second administration is already coming together at a much faster pace than during his 2016 transition phase, naming more than 20 picks just over a week after Election Day, including high-profile choices such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to lead the State Department; and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as attorney general.""The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin, giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail — and his Cabinet picks reflect his priority to put America First. President Trump will continue to appoint highly qualified men and women who have the talent, experience and necessary skill sets to Make America Great Again,"" Leavitt told Fox News Digital when asked about Trump's speedy roll-out of Cabinet picks earlier this week.

President-elect Trump to meet Biden in Oval Office Wednesday,"President-elect Trump is set to meet President Biden at the Oval Office on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Saturday.The announcement comes as the pair work towards a transition of power which will conclude with Trump being sworn in as the 47th president on Jan. 20, 2025.""At President Biden’s invitation, President Biden and President-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. Additional details to follow,"" Jean-Pierre announced in a short statement. President Biden addressed the nation from the Rose Garden on Thursday after his Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the 2024 presidential election to President-elect Trump and pledged to a 'peaceful and orderly' transfer of power. Trump did not host Biden in 2020 as the 45th president contested the results. It has been tradition that the current first lady also hosts the incoming first lady at the White House.Trump has been busy working on his transition team since he was declared the winner early Wednesday, making a historic appointment by naming Susie Wiles as the first female chief of staff.""Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,"" Trump said in a statement. ""Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again…. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.""Trump's transition team is being headed by professional wrestling magnate Linda McMahon and billionaire businessman Howard Lutnick.Meanwhile, the Trump-Vance campaign on Saturday announced the formation of the ""Trump Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc.,"" a 501(c)(4) organization that will plan inaugural events. The organization will be co-chaired by longtime friends and supporters of President-elect Trump, Steve Witkoff and Senator Kelly Loeffler.""On Election Night, we made history and I have the extraordinary honor of having been elected the 47th President of the United States thanks to tens of millions of hardworking Americans across the nation who supported our America First agenda,"" President Trump said in a statement.""The Trump Vance Inaugural Committee will honor this magnificent victory in a celebration of the American People and our nation. This will be the kick-off to my administration, which will deliver on bold promises to Make America Great Again.""""Together, we will celebrate this moment, steeped on history and tradition, and then get to work to achieve the most incredible future for our people, restoring strength, success, and common sense to the Oval Office."" Biden on Saturday deflected a question that was shouted by a reporter as he left church in Delaware about whether Trump is ""still a threat to democracy.""""I am going to see him on Wednesday,"" Biden answered before getting into an SUV, also ignoring questions about what they would discuss.

"Republicans outpacing Democrats in North Carolina early voting, data shows","Republicans in North Carolina are outpacing Democrats in the state in early voting going into Saturday, according to new data from the state.North Carolina Board of Elections data of ballots cast through Friday shows over 1.4 million (59.95%) registered Republicans have cast their early vote compared to 1.35 million (55.19%) registered Democrats in the battleground state. In-person early voting in North Carolina ends on Saturday.The data shows a massive shift in early voting in the state, where four years earlier Democrats outpaced Republicans in early voting by more than a million votes, according to the state election board.Republicans have put an emphasis on encouraging voters to vote early this election year after seeing lower early turnout for the party compared to Democrats last cycle.North Carolina saw record turnout on the first day of early voting in the state, Oct. 17, when 353,000 registered voters cast their ballots.The North Carolina Elections Board passed a bipartisan emergency resolution that reformed the state's early voting process in 13 counties, including changing or adding voting sites and maintaining their availability, extending the hours and adding or reducing when any site is open within the early voting period, according to the election board.As of Friday, about 53.33% of ballots were already cast in North Carolina for the 2024 election.

New Jersey governor says he'll 'fight to the death' against Trump actions 'contrary to values',"In a Q&A following President-elect Trump’s victory, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy warned he will ""fight to the death"" against the administration if he detects behavior ""contrary to our values.""""[A]s we respect the peaceful transition of power, if there is any attack on the Garden State or any of its communities from Washington, I will fight back with every fiber of my being,"" Murphy said.""If there’s an opportunity for common ground, we will seize that as fast as anybody,"" he conversely added. State Assembly Minority Leader John DiMaio, R-Hackettstown, told Fox News Digital that Murphy is ""missing the message"" voters sent Tuesday with the initial rhetoric.""It’s time for the governor to recognize that his values may not reflect the values of New Jerseyans as widely as he assumes,"" he said.""While Murphy is prepared to spend resources on political battles with Trump, it’s hard to see how that aligns with the priorities of struggling families, working taxpayers and business owners who want more focus on their needs,"" DiMaio said.Murphy, who will begin his final year in Trenton after Trump is inaugurated, credited Trump with his ""uncanny ability to connect with people, even if it’s not in their own interests,"" after the Republican came proverbially close to taking the blue bastion.While Murphy rejected a reporter’s query about New Jersey being in play in the future, he commented that Trump only lost it by 4%, compared to 16% in 2020.""I do not believe we are a swing state,"" he said, adding that outside of Rep. Tom Kean Jr.’s victory along the Route 22 corridor, he was happy with the down-ballot results. Kean is a Republican.He pointed to Republicans’ success in messaging on the immigration crisis, adding the caveat that their winning rhetoric may not have matched the facts on the ground.Trump won Passaic County, an ethnically diverse New York City suburb, but down-ballot races skewed Democrat. Murphy pointed to that as an example of voters selecting Trump personally rather than Republicans writ large.He suggested the same was true in North Carolina, noting Trump won the state but Democrat Attorney General Joshua Stein was elected governor.""Just as it is our responsibility to continue to stand up against any threat to our state or to our people, it is also our responsibility to take any opportunity that presents itself to work with [Trump] to protect and uplift the people of our state because that is what responsible leaders do,"" Murphy added.He also credited Trump with quickly approving the new Portal North Railroad Bridge in Secaucus and assisting during the coronavirus pandemic.As for responding to Trump’s governance, Murphy said that during the last administration, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was reportedly conducting raids in search of illegal immigrants, he took an inventive tack.""There was a time when ICE was just randomly showing up on street corners and apprehending … brothers and sisters from the immigrant community,"" Murphy said.The governor, who lives in Middletown Township near Sandy Hook, said he heard an ""area near where I live was at-risk.""""I just went there one night with my [security] detail and just hung out there,"" he said, noting ICE then didn’t show.""Whether that scared them off or not I don’t know, but it’s an example of a small step that we’re willing to try anything if it's contrary to our values.""As the 2025 gubernatorial race to replace him is about to heat up, Murphy said his three-point win in 2021 may have been ""the canary in the coalmine"" for Democrats in the state to assess the political landscape.",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-jersey-governor-says-hell-fight-death-against-trump-actions-contrary-values
Trump tapping 2 House Republicans for future admin fuels concerns about slim possible majority,"President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of two House Republicans to serve in his administration could pose issues if the GOP’s majority in the chamber ends up critically thin.Trump has selected House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., as his ambassador to the United Nations, while a source told Fox News Digital that he picked Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., to be his National Security Adviser.Both represent Republican stronghold districts that have little chance of falling into Democratic hands in special elections.However, those special elections could take place weeks or months after the new term begins in January 2025, which could slow down Trump’s plans for an ambitious first 100-day agenda.""That's an agenda we've been working on with President Trump for months now. We didn't wait until the day after the election to start planning this, and this shows the relentless focus of Donald Trump,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said during a press conference on Tuesday.""I know he's already pulled a few really talented people out of the House – hopefully no more for a little while until special elections come up, but it shows you the talent that we have and the ability we have.""House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., similarly said he did not believe Trump would select any more House members for his administration and said he and Trump broached the topic in discussions.""President Trump fully understands and appreciates the math here, and it's just a numbers game. You know, we believe we're going to have a larger majority than we had last time. It's too early to handicap it, but we are optimistic about that,"" Johnson said.""But every single vote will count, because if someone gets ill or has a car accident or a late flight on their plane, then it affects the votes on the floor. So, I think he and administration are well attuned to that. I don't expect that we will have more members leaving, but I'll leave that up to him.""House Republicans are on track to win a single-digit majority in the chamber.It is not much different than it was during the 118th Congress, but GOP leaders will likely face more pressure to keep members in line when working to enact Trump’s will.",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tapping-2-house-republicans-future-admin-fuels-concerns-about-slim-majority
Republicans projected to keep control of House as Trump prepares to implement agenda,"The Fox News Decision Desk can project that Republicans will keep their majority in the House of Representatives.The number of seats the party will hold depends on the outcome in a handful of remaining districts.There are nine races yet to be called. They are: Alaska’s at-large district, California’s 9th, 13th, 21st, and 45th districts, Iowa’s 1st district, Maine’s 2nd district, Ohio’s 9th district and Oregon’s 5th district.Republicans soared to the 218 threshold for majority after Republican Juan Ciscomani was elected in Arizona’s 6th District. The first-term Republican won a rematch against Democrat Kirsten Engel, whom Ciscomani narrowly defeated in the 2022 midterms.In a statement, The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) said that the majority win came after a ""historically tumultuous cycle,"" saying that they ""never lost focus and never stopped working.""""They said it couldn’t be done, but the American people have spoken. As Chairman of the NRCC it has been my mission since day one to hold our House majority. Today it is clear that we accomplished that mission. Even through a historically tumultuous cycle our team never lost focus and never stopped working,"" NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson said in a release on Wednesday night.""Americans are fed up with extreme Democrats who threw open the border, set inflation on fire, and invited drugs and crime to flood our communities,"" he said. ""With a Republican House majority, President Donald Trump back in the White House, and a new Senate majority, help is on the way. I am looking forward to working with my newly elected colleagues to clean up Democrats’ mess with an America First agenda.""Mike Johnson, whose rise to speaker last year ended a leadership battle in the House, is likely to continue serving as the 56th Speaker.It comes despite a tumultuous term for the House GOP marked by fierce public infighting over government spending and the first-ever ouster of a speaker of the House.Republicans’ chances of keeping the House majority seemed like a pipe dream in October 2023. Congress was paralyzed while GOP lawmakers fought behind closed doors to select a new leader after ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was booted by all House Democrats and eight Republican rebels.Those odds improved significantly when Democrats had their own leadership crisis as top liberals pressured President Biden to drop out of the race after his disastrous debate against former President Trump.Vice President Kamala Harris gave Democrats an enthusiasm and funding boost when she took over Biden’s mantle, but it was not a big enough bump to carry their House candidates through November.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News Digital late last month that he anticipated the battle for control to come down to roughly 40 or 45 races.""There’s really only about 10% — roughly 45 seats — that are truly competitive. And, by that, I mean the really battleground districts are about half Republican-held and about half Democrat-held,"" Scalise said.""We're going around the country helping the incumbents on the Republican side or in tough races. But, also, we're working on those challengers who have a real opportunity to flip a seat from Democrat to Republican.""",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-projected-keep-control-house-trump-prepares-implement-agenda
Trump appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast for nearly three hours: Here are the top moments,"Former President Trump taped ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast for nearly three hours on Friday. The podcast, recorded in Austin, Texas, afforded the Republican presidential nominee exposure to Rogan's 14.5 million followers on Spotify and 17.6 million followers on YouTube. Rogan, the nation's most-listened-to podcast host, is extremely influential with young male voters, who Trump is aiming to reach. Here are the top takeaways from the podcast that aired on Friday. Trump reveals the ‘biggest mistake’ he made during his first term Trump told Rogan that he regretted some of the appointments he made in his first term. ""The one question that you'll ask me that I think you'll ask me that people seem to ask – and I always come up with the same answer – if I, the one mistake because I had a lot of success, great economy, great everyth, everything was great with the military rebuilt the biggest tax cuts in history, all the stuff we did, we had a great presidency,"" Trump said. ""Three Supreme Court justices. Most people get none. You know, you pick them young this way. They're there for 50 years. Right. So, you know, even if a president is there for eight years, oftentimes they never have a chance. I had three. It was the luck of the draw.""""But I will say that it always comes back to the same answer,"" Trump said. ""The biggest mistake I made was I picked some people, I picked some great people, you know, but you don't think about that. I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked. I picked a few people that I shouldn't have picked."" ""And neocons,"" Rogan said. ""Yeah, neocons or bad people or disloyal people,"" Trump said. Trump asks Rogan to explain why he's gotten bad publicity: ‘You said a lot of wild s---’ While explaining the process of choosing political nominations once he got into office, Trump discussed his initial appointment of John Bolton, who served as White House National Security adviser. In 2019, Trump fired Bolton, who remains a staunch critic. Trump described how Phil Ruffin, a fellow American businessman, warned him that Bolton was a ""bad guy,"" but by then, Trump had already hired him. ""And he was right. But he was good in a certain way. He's a nut job. And every time I had to deal with a country when they saw this whack job standing behind me, they said, 'Man, Trump's going to go to war with us.' He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East. They should have never done it. I used to say it as a civilian, so I always got more publicity than other people,"" Trump said. ""It wasn't like I was trying,"" Trump said. ""In fact, I don't know exactly why. Maybe you can tell me."" ""I could definitely tell you,"" Rogan offered. ""You said a lot of wild s---. … And then CNN in all their brilliance by highlighting your wild s--- made you much more popular. And they boost you in the polls because people were tired of someone talking in this bulls--- pre-prepared politician lingo. And even if they didn't agree with you, they at least knew whoever that guy is, that's him. That's really him."" Rogan tells Trump ‘the rebels are Republicans now,’ Elon Musk agrees""The rebels are Republicans now, though, like you want to be invisible, you want to be punk rock, you want to like, buck the system? You're a conservative now,"" Rogan said. ""That's how crazy. And then the liberals are now pro-silencing criticism. They're pro-censorship online. … [T]hey come in regulating free speech and now regulating the First Amendment. It's bananas to watch."" Elon Musk, who took over Twitter — now X — in 2022, responded to the clip, writing, ""Exactly."" ""You know they come after their political opponent,"" Trump told Rogan in response. ""I've been investigated more than Alfonse Capone."" Trump says he told North Korea's Kim Jong Un to ‘just relax,' ‘go to the beach’ In his meeting with former President Obama during the presidential transition period, Trump recalled, ""Obama thought we were going to go to war with North Korea."" Rogan then referenced how Trump dubbed North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ""Little Rocket Man"" early on in his first term. ""I said, 'Little Rocket Man, you're going to burn in hell.' And it was rough,"" Trump said. ""I got to know him better than anybody, anybody. And I said, 'Do you ever do anything else? Why don't you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach?' You know, kiddingly, I said, 'You're always building nuclear. Just relax. You don't have to do it. Let's build some condos.'""Trump discusses ‘Make America Healthy Again,' initiative, says he told RFK Jr. ‘just focus on health’ Rogan praised Trump for partnering with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to ""Make America Healthy Again"" and asked the Republican presidential nominee if he would completely commit to having Kennedy, a former independent presidential candidate, as part of his administration. ""Oh, I am, but the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental. Because, you know, he doesn't like oil. I love oil,"" Trump said. ""I think just keep him out of the fire. So I'm going to keep him out of a little bit. I said focus on health. Focus. You could do whatever you want, but, I got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold."" Rogan, showing Trump charts, referenced how ""there are chemicals and ingredients in our food that are illegal in other countries because they've been shown to be toxic."" ""There's pesticides and herbicides, and there's a lot of sh-- that's been sprayed on our food that really is unnecessary,"" the podcaster said. ""And there's a lot of health consequences."" Rogan added that Kennedy recently told him that ""more than 70% of young men are ineligible for the military because of their health."" ""But RFK is going to be – you know I think he's a great guy,"" Trump said. Rogan also asked if Trump faced pressure not to work with Kennedy. ""But I would say that the Big Pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard that,"" Trump said. ""I've actually always gotten along very well with him. I've known him a long time. He's a different kind of a guy. He's very smart, great guy, and he's very sincere about this. I mean, he really is. You know, he thinks we spend a fortune on pesticides and all this stuff, and then you end up at that chart is a terrible shot."" Trump blasts botched Afghanistan withdrawal, ‘stupid’ Milley for leaving behind billions of dollars worth of equipmentRogan and Trump discussed the botched Afghanistan withdrawal under the Biden-Harris administration. In addition to the 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing at Kabul airport, Rogan referenced how the United States left behind billions of dollars worth of equipment now seen in Taliban military parades. Trump said President Biden should have fired everyone involved in planning the withdrawal, taking issue with retired Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump and Biden. Trump said U.S. troops should have left last from Bagram Air Base because it's located ""one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles"" and should have taken all their equipment with them. ""Every plane, every screw  should have been taken out, every tent. And I said that. That's when I realized that Milley was a dummy. I said, 'we're leaving, but I want to get everything out,'"" Trump said. ""'Sir, it's cheaper to leave it,'"" Trump said Milley told him. ""It's cheaper to leave it?"" Rogan asked. ""Yeah, he said it's cheaper to leave it,"" Trump affirmed. ""Cheaper?"" Rogan asked again. ""Not more dangerous?"" ""He just said cheaper,"" Trump said. ""I said ‘I want every plane, I want every tank, I want the goggles, said night goggles. They have all this stuff that these guys now have.’ He said, 'sir, it's cheaper to get out and leave it.' I said, so you think it's cheaper to leave $150 million brand new airplane in there than it is to fly it out with a tank of jet fuel and put it in Pakistan, or just fly it directly back?"" ""'It's cheaper to leave it.' I said, 'this guy's nuts,'"" Trump added. ""I'm telling you, he was so stupid. He was so unwise. He was like an unwise man. And there were a number of them."" Trump also recalled how he spoke with Taliban’s chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. ""I had a couple of conversations with Abdul, and from the time I had those conversations, because they were shooting our soldiers, you know, with the sniper stuff,"" Trump said. ""They were shooting a lot with Obama, much less with me. But they were shooting them. And I said, get this guy on the phone. The press went nuts when they heard this. I had a great conversation – It was a tough conversation. 18 months later, there wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at, and even Biden admitted it in a moment of stupidity."" Trump floats idea of replacing federal income tax with tariffs Trump spoke of efforts to have cars made in the United States, specifically to revitalize the once booming industry in Detroit, Michigan. Recently, Trump threatened a large auto plant ""being built by China in Mexico"" that he would implement 100 or 200% tariffs on every car made there if he wins, so ""they'll be unsaleable in the United States."" In response, the plant reportedly announced it would stop production. ""This was the biggest plant in the world. It would have more than all of Michigan makes. That's how big,"" Trump said. ""You know, this is what we're getting to. And I said, if that plant goes up, I want them to understand if I win, I'm going to tax those cars at the rate of 100 or 200% apiece so that you won't be able to sell them in the United States. They just announced they're not going to build the plant."" ""I did a big favor for our country by doing that. And I'm not even there yet. To me, the most beautiful word, I've said this for the last couple of weeks in the dictionary today is the word tariff,"" Trump continued. ""It's more beautiful than love, more beautiful than anything. It's the most beautiful word. This country can become rich with the use, the proper use of tariffs."" ""Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?"" Rogan interjected. ""Were you serious about that?""""Yeah, sure. Why not?"" Trump said. ""Our country was the richest, relatively in the 1880s and 1890s. A president who was assassinated, named McKinley, he was the tariff king."" ""He spoke beautifully of tariffs. His language was really beautiful. ‘We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price. And the big price is tariffs.’ And he'd speak like that. But he was right,"" Trump said. ""And then around in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to, frankly, an income tax."" Trump discusses the possibility of life on Mars Trump said he has interviewed jet pilots who described seeing what looked like a ball that traveled four times faster than an F-22 plane, opening the conversation up to the subject of UFOs. ""It's not a great interest for me, but it's a little interest. I get that question as much as almost any question. Do you think that we have aliens coming, you know, flying around or whatever?"" Trump said. ""I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life, you know?"" Trump responds to Kamala Harris comparing him to Hitler: ‘Very low IQ person’Trump described Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Karris as a ""very low IQ person,"" when Rogan asked him about how Harris compared her Republican opponent to Adolf Hitler. ""There's the rhetoric is also that you're Hitler and that in order to stop Hitler, you have to do whatever,"" Rogan said. ""I mean, you're hearing this now, Kamala compared you, said you love Hitler yesterday."" ""Kamala is a very low IQ person. She's a very low IQ. You know, I'm for taking tests too. I think anybody that runs for president should take, they should give them a test,"" Trump said.""And it's not an age thing,"" Trump said. ""If you look back on history, 70s and 80s, your greatest, some of your greatest leaders in the world, world history, long time world history, they were in their 70s, in their 80s. But I think you should take cognitive tests. I think everybody – they say it's unconstitutional, but I think that's ridiculous. I think Kamala should have a test because there's something missing. There's something wrong with her."" ""Well, I think it's pressure,"" Rogan said. ""I think the pressure and the scrutiny. You've been a celebrity for a long time, and you understand what this is like. But for someone who's in her late 40s, who becomes the vice president, who runs for president, becomes a vice president, and then all of a sudden, the weight of the world is on your shoulders. And there's all these people, a lot of people clam up."" ""But you either have it or you don't,"" Trump said. Rogan agreed, ""Correct."" From the official vice presidential residence at the White House on Wednesday, Harris accepted the claim of former Trump White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who said Trump wanted ""Hitler's generals."" Harris said her GOP opponent is ""unhinged"" and seeks ""unchecked power.""Rogan reveals why he decided to have Trump on his podcast Rogan acknowledged how the Republican presidential nominee appeared on his friend and fellow comedian Theo Von's ""This Past Weekend"" podcast in August. ""Is that why you called me to do this?"" Trump asked.""No, no,"" Rogan said. ""Once they shot you, I was like, he's got to come in here. It's all about timing. I think our timing is perfect… Do you even have a scar on your ear? You got anything on there?"" ""I do,"" Trump said, ""so right over here."" ""Oh, it's a tiny mark,"" Rogan said. ""It zinged right there,"" Trump said, motioning to the side of his ear. ""It healed up pretty f---ing good,"" Rogan offered. ""Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah, it's a little... It's not like some of the wrestlers, some of the UFC fighters,"" Trump said. ""It was sort of like a top shot.. but it makes me a tougher guy.""

"RFK Jr., on eve of Election Day, tells voters 'do NOT vote for me'","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is telling Americans ""do NOT vote for me"" on the eve of Election Day, adding in a video that a vote for Trump is ""the only way that we can get me and everything I stand for into Washington, D.C. and fulfill the mission that motivated my campaign."" The fresh plea comes after the Supreme Court last week denied separate appeals by RFK Jr. to remove his name from the ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan.  ""I've asked my voters repeatedly to vote for President Trump, but even a few votes for me in [Michigan] could swing the ballot in a way that the public doesn't intend and the voters don't intend,"" he told ""America's Newsroom"" on Sunday.Kennedy, who once was running as an independent presidential candidate, has been trying to get his name off ballots in key battleground states since he suspended his campaign in August and endorsed Trump. ""Hey everybody, a lot of people are asking me if they live in a red state or blue state should they still be voting for me? What about swing states? The answer is easy – no,"" RFK Jr. then said in a video posted to his X account on Monday. ""No matter what state you live in, you should be voting for Donald Trump. And let me tell you why. That’s the only way that we can get me and everything I stand for into Washington, D.C. and fulfill the mission that motivated my campaign,"" he continued. Above the video, RFK Jr. wrote ""No matter what state you live in, do NOT vote for me"" and ""Let's get President Trump back in the White House and me to Washington so we can Make America Healthy Again, end the forever wars, and protect our civil liberties."" When he suspended his campaign, Kennedy said he planned to keep his name on the ballot in safe Democratic and Republican states, but didn’t want to be a spoiler in battleground states.

'Admires dictators': Harris continues comparing Trump to Hitler during battleground state town hall,"Vice President Kamala Harris joined CNN in Pennsylvania for a town hall with undecided voters on Wednesday, where the Democratic presidential nominee doubled down on her rhetoric comparing former President Donald Trump to Nazi Germany dictator Adolf Hitler. ""If the president of the United States, the commander in chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, 'Why can't you be more like Hitler's generals?' Anderson, come on. This is a serious, serious issue. And we know who he is. He admires dictators, sending love letters back and forth with Kim Jong-Un,"" Harris said of Trump on Wednesday evening in a town hall moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper. Earlier Wednesday, former Trump administration chief of staff John Kelly claimed to the media that Trump praised ""Hitler's generals"" for their loyalty. Harris posted on X that Trump is ""out for unchecked power"" before also comparing Trump to the Nazi dictator. ""Donald Trump is out for unchecked power. He wants a military like Adolf Hitler had, who will be loyal to him, not our Constitution,"" Harris posted to X earlier Wednesday. ""He is unhinged, unstable, and given a second term, there would be no one to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses.""Cooper pressed Harris about the rhetoric in his first question to the Democratic nominee on Wednesday evening, sparking Harris to double down and also say she believes that Trump is a ""fascist."" ""You quoted General Milley calling Donald Trump a fascist. You, yourself, have not used that word to describe him. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?"" Cooper asked Harris towards the start of the town hall. ""Yes, I do. Yes, I do,"" Harris responded. Harris' comments come after Trump survived two assassination attempts on his life since July. Trump has blamed the attacks on heated rhetoric from Democrats. Harris spoke directly to the undecided battleground state voters during the live town hall Wednesday, including telling one voter that if she wins on Nov. 5, her administration will be different than Biden's. ""Considering you've been in the position of vice president for the past four years under the Biden administration, how can we expect you to deviate from the direction of that administration compared to your own? How can we differentiate your policy and your beliefs from that of Biden's?"" the audience member asked Harris. Harris, who has previously said while on the campaign trail that she couldn't think of anything she would have done differently from Biden, said Wednesday that her administration would be different than Biden's leadership. ""First of all, my administration will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience. I represent a new generation of leadership on a number of issues, and believe that we have to actually take new approaches,"" Harris said. ""For example, what we talked about in terms of housing. My experience that leads to that priority, includes what I did to take on the big banks around the foreclosure crisis. When I brought billions of dollars to homeowners that were the subject of predatory lending. I know what homeownership means to the American people, not to mention what it meant to my mother, who worked very hard and saved up, so that by the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home.""The town hall event kicked off at 9 pm on Wednesday from Chester Township, which is located less than 20 miles outside of Philadelphia. The event was held after CNN proposed holding a third presidential debate -- including Biden's first debate before dropping out of the race -- on Oct. 23. Harris accepted the invite and Trump declined, leading to the town hall. Harris was also pressed about her border and immigration policies, including a bipartisan bill that would provide funding for a border wall that Harris previously lambasted as a ""stupid"" idea when promoted by Trump during his administration. ""Let's talk about this compromise bill that you want to pass if you are elected. You said that's going to be a priority. It includes $650 million in funding for the border wall. That's something Republicans wanted, that was part of the compromise. Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. You called it ‘stupid, useless, and a medieval vanity project.’ Is a border wall stupid?,"" Cooper asked Harris. ""Let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall,"" Harris said while laughing. ""So remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. Come on, they didn't. How much of that wall did he build? I think the last number I saw was about 2%. And then when it came time for him to do a photo op, you know, where he did it? In the part of the wall that President Obama built.""""But you agreed to a bill that would earmark $650 million to continue building that wall,"" Cooper pressed. ""I pledge that I am going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen and secure our border. Yes, I am, and I'm going to work across the aisle to pass a comprehensive bill that deals with a broken immigration system,"" Harris responded. ""We need a president who is grounded in common sense and practical outcomes, like, let's just fix this thing. Let's just fix it. Why is there any ideological perspective on this? Let's just fix the problem,"" she continued, adding that non-citizens need to ""earn"" citizenship. ""So you don't think it's stupid anymore?"" Cooper continued. ""I think what he did and how he did it was, did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. I just talked about that wall, right? We just talked about it. He didn't actually do much of anything,"" she responded. Pennsylvania is a key state again this election, with both Harris and Trump vying to win the state to clear the path to an overall victory. Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.Harris leaned into her support of abortion during the town hall, claiming that red state abortion policies have led to women's deaths. The Harris campaign and Democrats have previously claimed that at least two women in Georgia died due to ""restrictive"" abortion laws, with OB-GYNs subsequently criticizing the narrative as a misleading story pushed by the media. ""Trump abortion bans, some that make no exception, even for rape or incest. One of the areas I specialized in as a prosecutor was crimes against women and children. The idea you would tell a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. This is what's happening in our country. You all may have heard the stories. Women have died. Women have died because of these laws and the suffering,"" Harris said. Harris called for the end of the filibuster last month in an effort to pass a law restoring abortion access nationwide, which was slammed by lawmakers and conservatives as an attack on democracy. The filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.Cooper pressed Harris on the matter Wednesday, asking: ""You've talked about codifying Roe v Wade. That would require 60 votes in the Senate, a majority of the House. That's a big, that's a big leap. We don't have that yet. If that's not possible to codify it in the House, what do you do?""Harris responded that it was time to revisit the filibuster. ""I think we need to take a look at the filibuster, to be honest with you. But the reality of it is this, let's talk about how we got here. When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v Wade,"" she said. ""And they did as he intended. And now, in 20 states, we have abortion bans."" Harris' appearance unfolded as the Wall Street Journal published a new poll finding Trump in the lead nationally, at 47% support to Harris' 45%.

Dem Party blame game: Accusations fly as to who is responsible for Harris' massive loss to Trump,"The Democratic blame game is at a fever pitch after Vice President Kamala Harris was swiftly defeated by President-elect Donald Trump at the ballot box in an election that had been anticipated to drag out for days as polling indicated the match-up was razor-thin. Trump sailed to victory in the early morning hours last Wednesday, after locking down key battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania and Georgia and clearing 270 electoral votes. He concluded the race with 312 electoral votes to Harris’ 226, and won the popular vote. In the final days of the campaigning cycle, polling indicated that the results for the election would likely be very close, which could have resulted in state recounts and lawsuits before the winner was announced. Following Trump’s clear victory, Democrats across the nation issued statements accepting the results and congratulating the president. Fallout from the devastating loss, however, has reverberated across the party as members point fingers at each other for the Trump win. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders pinned blame for the loss on the Democratic Party for ""abandoning"" the working class, sparking rebuke from former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. ""It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,"" Sanders posted to X last week, accompanied by a press release on the election results. ""And they’re right.""Pelosi responded that the party has not left the working class behind in favor of kowtowing to ""big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party,"" as Sanders had argued in his press release. ""With all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him [Sanders], for what he stands for, but I don't respect him saying that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working class families. That's where we are,"" Pelosi told The New York Times' ""The Interview"" podcast on Saturday.""Under President Biden, you see the rescue package, money in the pockets of people, the shots in the arm, children in school safely, working people back to work. What did Trump do when he was president? One bill that gave a tax cut to the richest people in America,"" she continued. Sanders doubled down on his remarks Sunday, telling NBC's Kristen Welker that ""the working people of this country are extremely angry."" ""Nancy is a friend of mine,"" Sanders said. ""But here is the reality. In the Senate in the last two years, we have not even brought forth legislation to raise the minimum wage to a living wage despite the fact that some 20 million people in this country are working for less than $15 an hour."" ""Bottom line, if you're a working person out there, do you really think that the Democratic Party is going to the max, taking on powerful special interests and fighting for you? I think the overwhelming answer is no,"" Sanders said.Harris, Biden campaigns pin blame on each other The Harris campaign and Biden campaign have reportedly pinned blame for the loss on each other, Axios reported last week. ""The 107-day Harris campaign was nearly flawless. The Biden campaign that preceded it was the opposite,"" one Harris campaign member told the outlet. ""We did what we could. I think the odds against us were insurmountable,"" another individual involved with the Harris campaign said, referring to President Biden’s exit from the presidential race in July and his low approval ratings. Biden dropped out of the race over the summer following his disastrous debate performance against Trump, where he frequently lost his train of thought and stumbled over his words. The debate opened the floodgates to both conservatives and traditional Democrat allies calling on the president to pass the torch to a younger generation as concerns mounted surrounding his mental acuity and his age. Many of those who worked on the Biden campaign also joined the Harris campaign following the president’s endorsement of his VP to take up the mantle as Democratic presidential candidate. A person who worked on the Biden campaign shot back in comment to Axios that the Harris team was to blame: ""How did you spend $1 billion and not win? What the f—?""""The Harris team benched [Biden], and then they lost, so now the people who represent Biden are saying, 'Maybe you shouldn't have benched him,'"" another person familiar with the dynamics between the teams said. White House spokesman Andrew Bates told the outlet, ""Anyone criticizing the vice president's campaign is at odds with President Biden.""Pelosi points to Biden for loss Pelosi appeared to pin blame for the loss on the president, claiming that Biden had dropped out of the race too late in the game and that that hadn’t provided an opportunity for an open primary. ""Had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,"" she told the New York Times podcast. ""The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, that there would be an open primary,"" Pelosi continued. "". . . Because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier, it would have been different."" Biden dropped out of the presidential race on a Sunday afternoon in July via a social media post. He endorsed Harris minutes later in a follow-up X post, sparking other Democrats to rally around the VP. Pelosi did defend Biden in June, when the Wall Street Journal ran an article doubting Biden’s mental fitness as president.""Many of us spent time with @WSJ to share on the record our first-hand experiences with @POTUS, where we see his wisdom, experience, strength and strategic thinking,"" Pelosi wrote on X at the time. ""Instead, the Journal ignored testimony by Democrats, focused on attacks by Republicans and printed a hit piece.""Pelosi, as well as other high-profile Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, also notably called on Biden to run for a second term ahead of the 2024 cycle kicking off in earnest. Obama to blame?Other Democrats and insiders pointed to former President Barack Obama for the loss, after Obama reportedly worked in the background over the summer to encourage Biden’s ouster from the race. A handful of Obama's allies and former advisers helped lead the charge in calling on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race earlier this summer, including former Obama adviser David Axelrod saying that Biden was ""not winning this race;"" longtime Obama friend George Clooney calling on the president to drop out of the race in a bombshell op-ed; and Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama, also calling on Biden to drop out of the race ahead of his eventual departure. ""There is no singular reason why we lost, but a big reason is because the Obama advisers publicly encouraged Democratic infighting to push Joe Biden out, didn’t even want Kamala Harris as the nominee, and then signed up as the saviors of the campaign, only to run outdated Obama-era playbooks for a candidate that wasn’t Obama,"" one former Biden staffer told Politico.DNC National Finance Committee member and Harris campaign fundraiser Lindy Li told Fox News this weekend that Obama’s seemingly delayed endorsement of Harris after Biden dropped out added to Harris’ defeat. ""I want to point out they waited three days – Michelle and Barack Obama waited three days to endorse Kamala Harris,"" Li said on ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" on Saturday. ""It was the silence heard round the world.""""The truth is, this is just an epic disaster – this is a $1 billion disaster,"" Li added during the interview. Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, with the Obamas endorsing Harris in a video message posted to social media on July 26, five days after Biden’s announcement. The silence was not lost on the media, as headlines spread across the nation on Obama’s ""silence."" David Axelrod says Dem Party morphing into ‘smarty-pants, suburban, college-educated party’Similar to Sanders, longtime Democratic strategist David Axelrod appeared to pin blame for the loss on the Democratic Party’s shift away from blue-collar, middle class voters. ""You can’t approach working people like missionaries and say, ‘We’re here to help you become more like us.’ There’s a kind of unspoken disdain, unintended disdain in that,"" the CNN contributor said last week. ""The only group ... Democrats won among were people who make more than $100,000 a year,"" Axelrod said. ""You can’t win national elections that way, and it certainly shouldn’t be that way for a party that fashions itself as the party of working people.""""I think Biden has done programmatically some good things for working people. But the party itself has increasingly become a smarty-pants, suburban, college-educated party, and it lends itself to the kind of backlash that we’ve seen,"" he continued.Claims of underwhelming VP choice After Biden's exit from the race, Harris simultaneously launched her campaign as well as her search for a running mate, combing through a list of high-profile Democrats and lesser-known allies before choosing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.Democrats ultimately rallied behind Walz, but another choice, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, was viewed by many as the better candidate to get the Democratic Party across the finish line victoriously.""As a founding member of She Shoulda Picked Shapiro, I think it's relatively clear now that she made a mistake,"" statistician Nate Silver told the New York Times ahead of Election Day. ""Pennsylvania seems to be lagging a little behind the other blue-wall states. Meanwhile, Walz was mediocre in the debate, and he's been mediocre and nervous in his public appearances.""Li told Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich from Howard University, where Harris held her election night party, that Shapiro would likely have aided the Harris campaign’s efforts to notch a massive victory. ""One of the things that are top of mind is the choice of Tim Walz as vice presidential candidate,"" Li said. ""A lot of people are saying tonight that it should have been Josh Shapiro. Frankly, people have been saying that for months.""Considering Pennsylvania's battleground-state status, the popular first-term governor was viewed as a potential key for the Harris campaign to reach the coveted 270 electoral votes to lock up the election. Shapiro, who is Jewish, was also touted as a potential bridge for the Harris campaign to court Jewish voters amid backlash over her previous comments defending anti-Israel protesters who rocked college campuses last year during the war in Israel.James Carville says Harris campaign fail could boil down to one interview Longtime Democratic political consultant James Carville said the Harris campaign’s loss could boil down to her interview on ""The View,"" when co-host Sunny Hostin asked Harris to identify an example of anything she would have done differently from Biden. ""I think if this campaign is reducible to one moment, we are in a 65% wrong-track country. The country wants something different. And she’s asked, as is so often the case, in a friendly audience, on 'The View,' 'How would you be different than Biden?' That’s the one question that you exist to answer, alright? That is it. That’s the money question. That's the one you want,"" Carville said on ""The Bulwark Podcast"" on Saturday. ""That’s the one that everybody wants to know the answer to. And you freeze. You literally freeze and say, ‘Well, I can’t think of anything,’"" Carville continued. Hostin had asked Harris in the October interview, ""If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?"" ""There is not a thing that comes to mind,"" Harris answered.Harris' comment stands in stark contrast to how voters were feeling: They were unhappy with the current administration's leadership.  Preliminary data from the Fox News Voter Analysis, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide, found that the majority of voters headed into the polls believing that the country was headed in the wrong direction. Voters, ahead of casting their ballots, reported that the country was on the wrong track (70%, up from 60% who felt that way four years ago) and that they were seeking something different. Most wanted a change in how the country is run, with roughly a quarter seeking complete and total upheaval.",10-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-party-blame-game-accusations-fly-who-responsible-harris-massive-loss-trump
Trump taps RFK Jr. to lead Department of Health and Human Services,"President-elect Trump on Thursday selected Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ""I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,"" Trump said in his announcement. ""The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country. Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!"" Trump added.The announcement comes just over a week after Trump won back the presidency.Kennedy thanked Trump on X shortly after, vowing to ""Make America Healthy Again"" and ""put an end to the chronic disease epidemic.""""Together we will clean up corruption, stop the revolving door between industry and government, and return our health agencies to their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science. I will provide Americans with transparency and access to all the data so they can make informed choices for themselves and their families,"" he wrote. Kennedy joined the 2024 campaign cycle as a candidate for the Oval Office. Kennedy, who is the son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, dropped out of the presidential election in August after initially running as a Democrat, before he switched to an independent run. He endorsed Trump shortly after suspending his campaign, hitting the campaign trail for the Trump-Vance ticket while touting his plans to ""Make America Healthy Again"" under a potential Trump presidency. Kennedy also spoke during Trump's historic Madison Square Garden rally last month, where he unleashed on the current state of the Democratic Party. ""The Democratic Party is the party of war. It's the party of the CIA. You had Kamala Harris giving a speech at the Democratic convention that was written by neocons. It was belligerent, pugnacious. It talked about domination of the world by the United States through our weapons of war. It's the party today that wants to divide Americans. It's a party that is dismantling women's sports by letting men play women's sports,"" he said. ""It's the party of Wall Street. It's the party of Bill Gates, who just gave $50 million to Harris. It's the party, and the Harris campaign is very proud that it received the endorsement of 50 former CIA agents and officers and of John Bolton and of Dick Cheney."" Kennedy was asked about his potential role in the next White House and whether he would begin ""clearing out the top level federal service workers that are currently at the FDA and the CDC.""He continued, ""In some categories, their entire departments, like the nutrition department in the FDA, they have to go. They’re not doing their job. They’re not protecting our kids. Why do we have Froot Loops in this country that have 18 or 19 ingredients, and you go to Canada, and it’s got two or three?"" This isn't the first time Kennedy was considered for a Cabinet position for a presidential administration. Back in 2008, then President-elect Obama reportedly strongly considered naming Kennedy to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Politico reported at the time.  Transition team spokesperson Karoline Leavitt joined Fox News earlier Thursday, where she noted more Cabinet picks would likely be announced later that afternoon, and also noted that Kennedy is a ""once in a generation thought leader"" who would likely be offered a position in the administration. ""Certainly President Trump wants to find a place for RFK Jr. He has made that very clear throughout the campaign. RFK Jr. is a once in a generation thought leader. He's an independent mind, a critical thinker. We definitely need more of that in Washington, D.C. As for his specific position, I'll let President Trump announce that. But RFK Jr. will focus in the Trump administration on making America healthy again. That's another promise that President Trump made on the campaign trail and with an appointment of RFK Jr. to whatever position President Trump decides. That promise will be delivered upon,"" Leavitt said. Earlier this week, Kennedy called on ordinary Americans to make suggestions about what policies and people should be put in place under Trump's second administration, with Kennedy allies launching a website called ""Policies for the People"" to facilitate the suggestions from voters.The website says that the suggestions will help fill the over 4,000 appointments across the entire executive branch.""President Trump has asked Bobby [Kennedy] to help ‘drain the swamp’ by giving him an influential leadership role on his transition team,"" a post on the website says. ""But Bobby cannot do this alone, so he is now turning to the wisdom and expertise of his supporters – and the larger community.""The website is similar to what tech billionaire Elon Musk has said about ""maximum transparency"" related to his upcoming role co-leading the Department of Government Efficiency. Known as ""DOGE,"" the task force will ""dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies,"" Trump said earlier this week. ""All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency. Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not cutting something wasteful, just let us know! We will also have a leaderboard for most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars. This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining,"" Musk posted to X of how DOGE will operate.

Trump White House victory called 'the greatest political comeback in American history',"From political pariah to the presidency.Four years after Americans booted then-President Trump from the White House and he left Washington in political disgrace two months later, after trying to overturn his election loss, they are sending him back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. ""It’s a political victory that our country has never seen before,"" Trump said in his celebration speech early Wednesday morning, as he pointed to his convincing electoral and popular vote victory over Vice President Kamala Harris.And his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, called Trump's victory ""the greatest political comeback in American history.""Trump, in his victory address, touted that his political movement was one that ""nobody's ever seen before… this was the greatest political movement of all time.""For an undisciplined candidate known for his hyperbole, Tuesday's election results appeared to prove Trump right.""This is a historic political realignment,"" seasoned Republican strategist Ryan Williams said. Williams argued that Trump ""basically threw out the coalition that Republicans had put together for the last several decades and reached out and doubled down on voting blocks that he thought he could make a connection with.""""He just expanded the party in a way that no other nominee has been able to do before. And I think that’s why the polling missed this, because he so radically changed the composition of the electorate,"" Williams highlighted.Preliminary data from the Fox News Voter Analysis of the 2024 election spotlighted that Trump ran up the score with his base while narrowing traditional Democratic advantages among Black, Hispanic, and young voters. Harris came close in her bid to become the first woman elected to the presidency but was unable to make enough gains in the ideological middle of the electorate to offset defections among groups that traditionally vote Democratic. The Fox News Voter Analysis is a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide which highlights the 2024 campaign’s key dynamics. For Trump, the 2024 campaign was a grueling two-year marathon. He announced his candidacy at his south Florida Mar-a-Lago club days after the 2022 midterm elections.And he launched his campaign amid criticism from many in his party that he was partially responsible for the GOP's lackluster performance in the midterm elections.But after a slow start, the former president eventually easily dispatched a field of GOP primary opponents – which last year briefly expanded to over a dozen contenders – as he ran the table earlier this year in the Republican presidential primaries.Trump, who was indicted in four different criminal cases, saw his support surge and his fundraising soar in the late spring of this year, after he made history as the first former or current president convicted of felonies.A month later, President Biden suffered a major setback after a disastrous late June debate performance against Trump reignited longstanding questions over whether the 81-year-old president was physically and mentally up for another four grueling years in the White House – and sparked calls from within his own party for him to step down.Trump's polling advantage over Biden widened, and the former president was further politically boosted after surviving an assassination attempt on his life at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, two days before the start of the Republican National Convention in July.But the race was instantly turned upside down days later, as Biden ended his re-election bid and endorsed his vice president. Democrats quickly coalesced around Harris, and her fundraising surged as her poll numbers soared.The Harris honeymoon continued through the late August Democratic National Convention, and into September, when most pundits declared her the winner of the one and only presidential debate between her and Trump. But as the calendar moved from September into October, Trump appeared to regain his footing, and public opinion surveys indicated the former president gaining momentum.Longtime GOP strategist David Kochel noted that we're ""still in a country where you have a 70% wrong track. The voters wanted to change who was in the White House.""Kochel, a veteran of numerous Republican presidential campaigns, noted that while Harris ""breathed some life into the campaign, some enthusiasm, the fundamentals didn’t change. People are unhappy with the economy. They think the country’s going in the wrong direction. And they wanted to make a change. And it turns out Trump won the change argument.""The Fox News Voter Analysis also spotlighted that in an election where voters across the country wanted change, they chose Trump’s outsider appeal over Kamala Harris’ promise to ""turn the page"" on the Trump era. kochel also noted that Trump's team ""ran a very effective swing state campaign with effective advertising that hurt her [Harris.].""Williams also applauded the Trump campaign, saying that they ""had a strategy and stuck with it. They just basically said we’re going with men… they doubled down on men.. they had a consistent strategy for it, and it worked.""And Williams argued that Harris ""basically took the Hillary Clinton playbook from 2016, xeroxed it, and made it worse.""And both strategists highlighted that Trump was able to overcome his many misstatements and controversial comments.""We pay so much attention to the crazy things Trump says. All that stuff that people find inappropriate. That stuff doesn’t matter,"" Kochel argued. ""He had a better strategy and an environment that played to his favor.""And Williams spotlighted that Trump ""has a way of understanding the electorate and connecting with people in a way that no other politician does. He just speaks off the cuff in his own way, and despite the fact that he tells a lot of mistruths, he’s viewed as being genuine because he’s not a polished politician.""",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-white-house-victory-called-the-greatest-political-comeback-american-history
Catholic swing voters were critical to Donald Trump's blowout victory: 'Harris snubbed us',"Catholic voters across the country swung massively towards former President Trump in the 2024 election, contributing to his surprise blowout victory on election night.Catholics were evenly split between President Biden and Trump in 2020, with 50 percent favoring Trump to 49 percent favoring Biden.According to exit polling collected by Fox News on election night, Catholics across the country swung 9 percentage points in Trump’s favor, with the former and now-future president winning Catholics by 10 points.Bill Donohue, president of the religious civil rights group Catholic League, told Fox News Digital that Catholics resoundingly rejected Harris because of what he called a ""clear animus against Catholics.""  ""She was rejected primarily because she is associated with the politics of extremism, and that is something the American people will never countenance,"" he said.There are approximately 52 million Catholic adults in the U.S., making it the largest religious denomination in the country. Until now, political opinions among Catholic voters have been split between the two parties, leading many to believe that there is no such thing as a Catholic voting bloc.But after Tuesday’s election results, Brian Burch, president of the conservative activism group CatholicVote, is saying that Catholic voters proved that theory wrong.""There is an emerging electoral trend here that Republicans, if they are smart, will latch onto,"" he told Fox News Digital.CatholicVote issued its first presidential endorsement in its history for Trump in January. The group devoted $10 million to advertising, education and a ""Catholic-to-Catholic"" canvassing program emphasizing the critical swing states.According to a CatholicVote memo shared exclusively with Fox News Digital, the group contacted over two million Catholic voters across the country, including approximately 100,000 ""high affinity, low propensity Catholics"" in the swing states Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.The memo states that the 2024 election has proven that ""Democrats have a Catholic problem, and must now wrestle with the growing influence of the progressive wing of [the] party that is openly hostile to people of faith.""Burch explained that ""Democrats in the past have been able to hold together a lot of Catholic voters, whether by tradition or by platitudes around social justice and posturing as if they cared about the poor and vulnerable.""""It turns out in this election, the poor and vulnerable are the people suffering from inflation and from an out-of-control border that had created crime and instability in their communities,"" he said.While the Catholic swing exceeded expectations on the national level, the margin of Catholic voters favoring Trump was even larger in some of the most critical swing states.In Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes and was considered the most important swing state by both candidates, Catholics make up a quarter of the electorate. According to Fox exit polling, Catholic voters in Pennsylvania favored Trump by a 13-point margin of 56% to 43%. Meanwhile, Catholic voters in two of the next largest swing states — North Carolina (16 electoral votes) and Michigan (15 electoral votes) — voted in Trump’s favor by 17 and 20 percentage points, respectively.Trump also won over Wisconsin Catholics by 16 percentage points, helping to deliver the state’s 10 electoral votes to the former president.According to the CatholicVote memo, there were two key moments in the 2024 presidential race in which Harris lost the Catholic vote. The first was when Harris told protesters in La Crosse, Wisconsin, that they were ""at the wrong rally"" after they shouted, ""Jesus is lord."" The second was when Harris said in an NBC interview that she opposed religious exemptions for doctors providing abortions.""Kamala Harris snubbed us, and she repeatedly affirmed our deepest fears about her animus and bigotry towards Catholics. She opposed a judicial nominee because he was Catholic. She introduced legislation that would cut our charities. She said there would be no accommodations for Catholics when it came to her abortion policies, which would effectively have ended Catholic health care in America,"" Burch explained.In short, Burch said it became clear that Harris presented ""a threat to our Catholic way of life.""Meanwhile, he said that Trump’s message of improving the economy and restoring law and order to the border and to communities has increasingly connected with everyday working-class Catholics. What has emerged, Burch said, is a ""new synthesis"" of what he called ""a populist social justice that prioritizes family first policies, America first economic policies, and then, in a larger way, the plight of the everyday American who feels left behind by their own government.""Burch shared that he has been in contact with Trump’s policy advisers ""fairly regularly"" about the issues most important to everyday Catholics and their families. He said that he spoke with Trump just before he took the stage at a rally in Milwaukee on Friday night.""We spoke about the importance of the Catholic vote and I told him that… Catholics were going to deliver this election for him,"" he said. ""It turns out I was right."" ",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/catholic-swing-voters-were-critical-donald-trumps-blowout-victory-harris-snubbed-us
"Nikki Haley responds after Trump says she won't be part of new cabinet, says she wishes him 'great success'","Nikki Haley, a Republican who ran against President-elect Trump months ago, responded after he publicly announced that she would not be joining his administration.Responding in an equally public format, Haley wrote that she wishes him ""great success.""""I was proud to work with President Trump defending America at the United Nations,"" she wrote in a X post Saturday. ""I wish him, and all who serve, great success in moving us forward to a stronger, safer America over the next four years,"" she said.Haley's gracious response came after Trump took to Truth Social to frankly state that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, as well as former Secretary of State and CIA Director Mike Pompeo would not be participating in his new cabinet. The announcement came after rumors have swirled regarding President-elect Trump's cabinet members.""I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,"" the president-elect posted on Truth Social early Saturday evening. ""I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country,"" he continued. ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""Haley during her run for the Republican candidate attempted to cast herself as an alternative to Trump, but eventually penned a supportive op-ed about the presidential candidate two days before Election Day.The former South Carolina governor wrote the recently-published opinion piece, which is titled ""Trump Isn’t Perfect, but He’s the Better Choice.""""I don’t agree with Mr. Trump 100% of the time,"" Haley conceded. ""But I do agree with him most of the time, and I disagree with Ms. Harris nearly all the time.

US Rep. Mike Rogers being considered for secretary of defense under Trump,"House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., is being considered to serve as secretary of defense in a second Trump administration. A source familiar with discussions told Fox News Digital Rogers has been contacted by the Trump transition team. Fox News Digital reached out to a spokesperson for comment.Rogers was re-elected to a third term Tuesday after running unopposed. Another potential candidate for defense secretary is Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., a retired Green Beret. In addition to serving in the military before joining Congress, Waltz was an adviser to defense secretaries Robert Gates and Donald Rumsfeld and spent time in the private sector as CEO of defense contractor Metis Solutions.He sits on the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees, in addition to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Republicans are bullish about keeping the House majority after victories in the Senate and the White House on election night. Replacing a House member, even one from a district that heavily favors one party or the other, generally takes at least several weeks. Republican leaders have already signaled they would not want to waste any time in using their majorities in Congress to forward Trump’s agenda.On Thursday, Trump announced his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, will serve as his White House chief of staff. House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is being discussed as a potential candidate for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, two people familiar with such discussions told Fox News Digital.",8-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-rep-mike-rogers-being-considered-serve-secretary-defense-trump
New York Judge Merchan to decide whether to dismiss Trump guilty verdict in Bragg case after election win,"New York Judge Juan Merchan on Tuesday is expected to decide whether to uphold or dismiss President-elect Donald Trump’s guilty verdict in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s case against him. Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, but was found guilty in May after a six-week-long unprecedented criminal trial in New York. Merchan is expected to issue a written opinion Tuesday on the president-elect's request to toss his conviction. Merchan could order a new trial or dismiss the indictment and charges altogether. Merchan was expected to rule in September, but wanted to ""avoid any appearance"" he was trying to influence the 2024 presidential election. Trump is currently scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 26. The sentencing was first set for July 11th, but then was delayed until September 18. Merchan delayed that sentencing date again until after the election. Trump’s attorneys have requested that Merchan overturn the guilty verdict, citing the United States Supreme Court’s decision that former presidents have substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts in office. Trump's legal team argued that certain evidence presented by Bragg and New York prosecutors during the trial should not have been admitted, as they were ""official acts."" Specifically, Trump attorney Todd Blanche argued that testimony from former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks; former Special Assistant to the President Madeleine Westerhout; testimony regarding The Special Counsel’s Office and Congressional Investigations and the pardon power; testimony regarding President Trump’s response to FEC Inquiries; his presidential Twitter posts and other related testimony was impermissably admitted during trial.Trump attorneys also pointed to Trump’s disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics as president. Blanche said that ""official-acts evidence"" that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg presented to the grand jury ""contravened the holding in Trump because Presidents ‘cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution,'"" the motion read. ""The Presidential immunity doctrine recognized in Trump pertains to all ‘criminal proceedings,’ including grand jury proceedings when a prosecutor ‘seeks to charge’ a former President using evidence of official acts.""Blanche argued that Bragg ""violated the Presidential immunity doctrine by using similar official-acts evidence in the grand jury proceedings that gave rise to the politically motivated charges in this case."" ""Because an Indictment so tainted cannot stand, the charges must be dismissed,"" Blanche argued. Blanche also explained that the Supreme Court’s decision does not allow for an ""overwhelming evidence"" or ""harmless error"" exception to ""the profound institutional interests at stake."" The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision on presidential immunity came from a question that stemmed from charges brought against Trump in a separate, federal case brought by special counsel Jack Smith related to the events on Jan. 6, 2021 and any alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in that case. Smith is winding down his cases against Trump following his election as the 47th president of the United States. Smith’s classified records case against Trump was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida earlier this year, who ruled that the special counsel was unlawfully appointed.",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-judge-merchan-decide-whether-dismiss-trump-guilty-verdict-bragg-case-after-election-win
George W Bush's daughter joins Harris on the campaign trail: 'It was inspiring',"George W. Bush's daughter, Barbara Pierce Bush, 42, joined the Harris campaign last weekend in Pennsylvania to help knock on doors and campaign for the potential future Democratic president. Bush's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris came after her mother and father said they had no plans to endorse either candidate for office. They did not vote for either candidate in 2016, writing ""None Of The Above"" on their ballots. This cycle, a significant cohort of staffers from the administrations of former Presidents George W. and George H.W. Bush have thrown their weight behind Harris, including a former Cabinet member. ""It was inspiring to join friends and meet voters with the Harris-Walz campaign in Pennsylvania this weekend,"" Bush told People magazine Tuesday. ""I’m hopeful they'll move our country forward and protect women’s rights."" In a photo circulating online, Bush could be seen standing at the front stoop of a home with several others, while donning a ""Kamala"" hat.In 2010, Bush, who also has a twin sister, told People that she does not identify with either major political party. But in the past, Bush has supported causes sympathetic to many in the Democratic Party, such as abortion and same-sex marriage. Her mother, Laura Bush, similarly broke with her family's Republican roots in 2010 when she, too, came out in support of abortion and gay marriage.""I am proud to stand with Planned Parenthood not only because women, regardless of where they are from, deserve to live dignified, healthy lives… because it’s a really good investment,"" Bush said at the time, according to a report from The Texas Tribune. In 2009, Bush co-founded a nonprofit called Global Health Corps, which seeks to strengthen health systems through its network of qualified young leaders and health professionals. Today, Bush is a mother of two – Cora and Edward.Bush's endorsement follows other GOP endorsements for Harris, including former Vice President Dick Cheney; Liz Cheney, former Wyoming congresswoman and daughter of Dick Cheney; Susan Ford Bales, the daughter of former President Gerald Ford; former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, as well as a handful of former Trump staffers.     ""Thank you, Barbara Bush, for standing for truth, decency, and freedom,"" Cheney said, following news of the endorsement.The Harris campaign has frequently touted support from Republicans, including running advertisements with former Trump administration officials, urging Americans not to vote for their former boss because he is unfit for the presidency.Earlier this month, Harris rallied with prominent Republicans in the swing state of Pennsylvania. The Oct. 16 rally was attended by Kinzinger and former Reps. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., Denver Riggleman, R-Va., Chris Shays, R-Conn., and David Trott, R-Mich. Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman were also present, alongside a handful of former Trump aides.""The Vice President is bringing together voters from across the political spectrum by running a campaign about freedom, democracy, and opportunity,"" Austin Weatherford, the Harris campaign's national director for Republican engagement, said in advance of the Oct. 16 rally. ""Our Republicans for Harris program is taking that unifying, inspiring message to anti-Trump Republicans, moderates, and independents.""The Trump campaign similarly insisted that it is building a ""diverse political movement,"" when reached for comment on this story.""President Trump is building the largest, most diverse political movement in history because his winning message of putting America first again resonates with Americans of all backgrounds,"" said Trump Campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt. ""Kamala Harris is weak, failed, and dangerously liberal and a vote for her is a vote for higher taxes, inflation, open borders, and war.""Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment but did not receive a response. And efforts to reach Barbara Pierce Bush were unsuccessful. ",29-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/george-w-bushs-daughter-joins-harris-campaign-trail-it-inspiring
President-elect Donald Trump's victory sends Hollywood into tailspin,"Former President Donald Trump has officially regained the Oval Office after being declared the president-elect following Tuesday's election.

Very soothing.""Jamie Lee CurtisThe morning following the election, Jamie Lee Curtis, a prominent advocate of the LGBTQ+ community, urged her followers to continue fighting for what they believe in.""So the results are in,"" she began. ""Many will be celebrating, possibly even gloating over their victory. Many will be stunned and sad with the terrible feelings of the loss. That is the same result despite who wins because that's what America and democracy looks like. Has always looked like. So what does it mean?""It means a sure return to a more restrictive, some fear draconian time. Many fear their rights will be impeded and denied. Many, minority groups and young people will be afraid. Gay and trans people will be more afraid. We know that many women will now find it difficult to get the reproductive healthcare that they need and deserve. For all those people there will be those who will help you. Me included,"" she continued.""But what it really means is that we wake up and fight. Fight for women and our children and their futures and fight against tyranny, one day at a time. One fight at a time. One protest at a time. That's what it means to be an American. That's what it has always meant and will always mean regardless of the outcome. Be gentle with people today.

I will [be] blocking each and every vicious, cruel person today. I will set boundaries. And when the leopards eat YOUR face?? Don’t come crying to any of us who fought for our civil rights AND yours.""""Have a nice life, bigots. I’d say ‘be blessed,’ but I won’t. Have exactly the life you deserve.""Ariana GrandeAriana Grande shared a short message on her Instagram story, noting the ""immeasurable heaviness"" of the results.The ""thank you, next"" singer wrote, ""Holding the hand of every person who is feeling the immeasurable heaviness of this outcome today.""Cardi BCardi B, who campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris, said in a now-deleted Instagram Story, ""This is why some of y’all states be getting hurricanes. That's what imma say,"" she said, referencing the recent natural disasters that caused destruction across the country.""In an additional Instagram Story, the rapper simply wrote, ""I hate yall bad.""On Wednesday morning, Cardi B penned a letter to the Vice President, writing in part on her Instagram, ""No matter what they've said to bring you down or belittle your run for presidency they can never say you didnt (sic) run your race with honesty and with integrity! You really put up a fight against all the odds that were already stacked against you!""Billie EilishBillie Eilish, who backed Harris in a video endorsement made alongside her brother, Finneas, back in September, had a brief reaction to Trump regaining the Oval Office.""It's a war on women,"" she wrote on her Instagram story.On Wednesday night, during her concert in Nashville, Eilish spoke directly to the crowd before playing her song, ""Your Power.""""Someone who hates women so, so deeply is about to be the President of the United States of America…So this song is for all the women out there.

Let's be tender with ourselves and one another.""Lili Reinhart""Riverdale"" actress Lili Reinhart spoke specifically to the women who have accused President-elect Trump of sexual assault. ""I cannot fathom the feeling of the women who came forward about their sexual assault at the hands of Trump. Seeing millions of people vote for their abuser. My heart absolutely breaks for these women. I believe you, and I am so sorry.""John CusackActor John Cusack voiced his disdain before the presidency had been called for Trump, writing to X in a since-deleted post, ""Harris may well come through Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania - the fact that the country would choose to destroy itself by voting in a convicted felon rapist and Nazi is a sign of deep nihilism To put it mildly.""The following morning, he doubled down on his statements, writing first, ""Well, if you want to know what it really looks like - Here it comes,"" followed by ""Get ready for the ethics [Stephen] miller . Child abducting Nazis with free rein.""Hilary DuffActress and mother of four, Hilary Duff reposted a popular message being spread across social media by the account We The Urban. The message reads, ""To women everywhere, You are the heartbeat of progress. You are seen, valued, and unstoppable. Your strength and prowess are changing the word.""Duff added her own anecdote, writing ""Incase you need a reminder today we will be ok.""Katy Perry, Kendall Jenner and Jessica Alba shared the original post on their respective Instagram stories.Chris Meloni""Law & Order: SVU"" actor Christopher Meloni chose to share a proverb to articulate his feelings. ""Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people,"" it read.""Americans, as a group, are not especially intelligent and can be readily entertained or fooled to produce a financial benefit for someone.""Bette MidlerBette Midler, who is a known adversary of Trump, quoted American journalist, H.L. Mencken in a now-deleted post to X.""When a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men of sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is the fact that they are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending any save the most elemental — men whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and whose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted, the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.""It appears Midler has deleted her account.Andy CohenAndy Cohen, one of the minds behind the highly successful reality television franchise, ""The Real Housewives,"" shared a video on his Instagram speaking with his son, Ben, about the election results.Cohen, who regularly shares these conversations with his kids on social media, asked Ben, 5, what he thought of the election. ""Donald Duck winned,"" he said.Cohen laughed before agreeing with his son. ""Well, we love our country don't we?"" he asked his son. ""We love our country, yes we do. We will - we will persist. We will move forward.""""God Bless America,"" he captioned the post.Mayim BialikFormer ""Jeopardy!"" host and ""The Big Bang Theory"" star Mayim Bialik took to Instagram to share her feelings about Trump coming out victorious, writing in part to Instagram, ""Many of us feel we do not belong right now and it feels scary and dangerous. The majority of this country likes the direction Trump will continue taking us. That's just what it is. I'm thinking a lot about all of the underserved populations who need support. I'm thinking about women and our bodies and our choices.""""I'm thinking about black people and brown people and minorities. Jews and Muslims. Queer folks all along the spectrum who have been caricatured and mocked throughout this campaign. I'm thinking about children who we teach to not speak of violence, hatred, and denigration of those less fortunate.""She concluded her post by writing, ""I hope we can find a way to move forward with compassion. More will always be revealed.""Bialik disabled comments from her post.Scott BaioScott Baio shared his ""November 6th, 2024 thoughts"" in a video shared on X. The actor read off many celebrities' names, including Robert De Niro, Taylor Swift and Julia Roberts, who had endorsed or campaigned for Harris, before blowing a raspberry.Hulk HoganHulk Hogan, who has been campaigning for Trump, showing up at rallies and ripping his shirt to express support for the former president, took to Instagram to share his thoughts about the results.""Believe it or not, brother, we’re more alike than we are different. This election season showed just how much we all care about where this country’s headed.

Harris-Trump showdown: First votes cast at midnight in tiny New Hampshire township,"The first results of the 2024 election day are in from Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris splitting the tiny town's six votes. The final count read out by officials around 12:10 a.m. on Tuesday morning were 3 for Trump and 3 for Harris.In 2020, future President Joe Biden swept all the votes there. Back in 2016, four people voted for Sen. Hillary Clinton, two for Trump and one for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson.The six citizens of Dixville Notch, which is a remote unincorporated township in New Hampshire's North Country region, cast their ballots at midnight. Before voters cast their ballots, Cory Pesaturo, three-time world accordion champion, performed an accordion rendition of the national anthem as voters held their hands over their hearts.The tiny village began its tradition of midnight voting in 1960.All eligible voters in the township - which totaled six in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation presidential primary in January - gathered in Dixville's Tillotson House, where voting remained open until everybody cast their ballot.Dixville Notch isn't the only New Hampshire town which has grabbed national attention with midnight voting on Election Day.Harts Location - in the state's White Mountains - started midnight voting in 1948. And Millfield, which is near Dixville Notch in New Hampshire's North Country, has also held midnight voting. But in the 2024 general election, Dixville Notch was the only location in New Hampshire holding midnight voting.Every four years - during the state's presidential primary and the general election - reporters and media outlets from around the country and the globe descend on Dixville Notch to cover the midnight vote.Tom Tillotson, the longtime town moderator of the vote, has noted that ""we get our 15 minutes of fame every four years.""",5-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-showdown-first-votes-cast-midnight-tiny-new-hampshire-township
"Fox News Power Rankings: Arizona is Trump's to lose, but this election is anyone's to win","After an unprecedented four years in politics, voters are evenly divided on who should next lead the free world.Former President Donald Trump is one state closer to a stunning comeback in this week's Fox News Power Rankings; the final forecast before the election.But Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris both have pathways to victory, and among many scenarios, it is plausible that Democrats win by a single electoral vote.A lot has happened but nothing has changedAmericans feel overwhelmed at the end of this presidential cycle. They have grappled with rising prices, illegal immigration, abortion laws, two global conflicts and the sudden departure of an incumbent from the presidential race.Meanwhile, Trump faced indictments over Jan. 6 and storing classified documents, crushed more than a dozen rivals after reentering the presidential race, and survived two assassination attempts.Through it all, the former president has kept an unbreakable bond with his voters. For more than a year, Trump has received support from between 48% to 50% of voters in the Fox News Poll, while support for the Democratic candidate has been more elastic.Now, as the final week of the campaign begins, this electorate is locked in. Polls show a tight national race and curiously, the battleground states are just as close.Both candidates rest their case on TrumpThis weekend, Harris spoke at a rally with Michelle Obama in Michigan with a sharply negative message about Trump and women’s health.The tone stood in contrast to previous appearances by the first lady and is a sign that the campaign feels the race is close, or even that they are behind.On Sunday, the vice president went to Philadelphia. There are more voters here than any other city in battleground Pennsylvania and combined, Black and Hispanic people make up the majority of its population.Those voters remain a weakness of Harris’ new coalition.Harris’ visit to a Puerto Rican restaurant the same day, however, proved to be more helpful than the campaign could have expected.Later that night, Trump made his closing arguments at Madison Square Garden.The event was visually powerful. Some Republicans on the fence about ""MAGA"" who saw throngs of supporters in red hats in Manhattan could have been persuaded that the movement is more popular and inclusive than before.But the program gave Democrats new attack lines about Trump and his allies’ dark rhetoric, and included jokes from an insult comedian about Puerto Rican, Latino, and Jewish people. The Trump campaign distanced itself from the remarks Monday, telling Fox News the joke ""does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.""These moments are not quite the strategic mistakes that some observers believe them to be. Trump has a long record of comments like these, and they help drive his supporters to the polls. But there is a large Puerto Rican community in Pennsylvania, where the margins will matter.The rally was a bow to the campaign’s full-throated effort to turn out young males, including low-propensity voters. This could be the bloc that gets Trump over the line on November 5.But last week, there were rumblings that this could be a reunion with Nikki Haley to play for the 20% of higher-propensity, non-MAGA Republicans who say they will vote for Harris in November. This event was not that.Trump still strong on two top issuesThe former president remains very well-positioned on two of the top three issues.The economy is by far and consistently the most important issue in deciding voters’ ballots. Voters say Trump will better handle the issue by 7 points. He is even more heavily favored on immigration at 15 points. The strength reverses for abortion, where voters favor Harris by 13 points.The issues polling looks less lopsided further down the list, though still with a Trump advantage. Harris leads on health care, climate change and election integrity, while Trump is ahead on Israel, crime, and guns.Fox’s latest survey also asked voters which issue was motivating them to vote. 12% said the economy, but 11% chose candidate character and values, and 10% said protecting democracy, rights, and freedoms would get them to the polls.In a toss-up race to 270, Arizona becomes Trump’s best battleground opportunityThe presidential race is a toss-up. Neither Harris nor Trump have the 270 electoral votes required to win the race. They need to win the right combination of six toss-up states worth a total 82 electoral votes to bring it home.Surveys show races within the margin-of-error in all the battleground states, but when looked at together, the polling in Arizona tells a different story.In eight high-quality polls conducted in this state since August, Trump has been ahead in seven. His edge has been between 1-6 points.That advantage does not exist for Harris or Trump in any other battleground state. Immigration continues to be a highly important issue in Arizona, which shares a border with Mexico. In the latest Wall Street Journal survey, 25% of voters said immigration was the most important issue to their vote, higher than any other battleground. It was a ""deal-breaker"" issue for 24% of voters. And Arizona voters preferred Trump on the issue by 10 points.Trump allies do not appear to be a drag. Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is less popular with voters despite their shared policies and traits (her Senate race remains Lean D). But the level of ticket-splitting is high and has endured throughout the campaign.This is still a highly competitive race. If Trump loses, it will be because of suburban growth and non-MAGA Republican voters, who are a strong faction. There is also an abortion measure on the ballot.But the statewide polling has been directionally consistent and immigration reigns supreme. Arizona moves from Toss Up to Lean R.(Fox News Power Rankings are nonpartisan pre-election predictions. Each ranking is informed by data, reporting, and analysis.)Both candidates have pathways to victoryBattleground states have been won and lost together in recent elections. Trump won the bulk of them in 2016; Biden flipped them back four years later.There are signs that the Democratic campaign is pursuing a path-of-least-resistance where they eke out a victory with half of those states.Harris and Walz’s schedules this week focus on Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These states account for about 60% of their time, the campaign’s most precious resource. Both nominees are visiting all three.(In deep blue DC, Harris will highlight Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the last election in a speech on the Ellipsis.)Democrats have also spent about 60% of their battleground advertising budgets in the same states; over $460 million.This suggests that the campaign is targeting wins in these states and Nebraska’s 2nd district, plus all the less competitive races Biden won last time.That would land them on 270 electoral votes, the minimum number required to win.This is one of many scenarios. But as the Harris campaign struggles to pull ahead, it is a very plausible one.There are 10 states that will likely remain in party hands but remain competitive in the final stretch. For Republicans, the first opportunity on a great night would be Virginia, where a Washington Post poll shows Harris up by six points, 49%-43%.Four Senate races become more competitiveRepublicans are poised to flip the Senate with at least 51 seats, beginning with an all-but-certain win in West Virginia, followed by Montana, where they have an edge. The next best opportunity is in Ohio, which is still a toss-up.Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin all move from Lean D and join the toss-up category this week.Republicans have been chipping away at their opponents’ leads in these states since the campaigns heated up, and polling now shows races within the margin-of-error.All three Democratic candidates are still over-performing the top of the ticket by a point or two, and the campaigns are clearly aware: they have all promoted their work with Trump on bipartisan bills in new television ads.The GOP is unlikely to pick off all three of these seats, but any would be gravy on top of a likely majority flip.Meanwhile, Republicans have been slow to respond to independent candidate Dan Osborn’s campaign in Nebraska. Incumbent GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has won twice before, but Osborn, a Navy veteran and local union leader, is now a serious threat.A new poll from the New York Times/Siena finds 46% of voters backing Osborn and 48% with Fischer; shockingly close for a conservative state. That is after GOP groups began telling voters that Osborn is a ""Bernie Democrat.""This Nebraska Senate race moves from Likely R to Lean R.The Senate could have other surprises in store, including Florida, where incumbent GOP Sen. Rick Scott continues to pour money into the race, and Texas, where Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is fighting for another term against Democratic Rep. Colin Allred. Both these races are still Likely R.Democrats spend big in a toss-up HouseThe House is still a toss-up.Beneath the surface, the battle for the gavel is getting more expensive. House candidates have spent more than $3 billion on their races so far, concentrated in roughly 40 battleground districts.Democrats have raised and spent nearly twice as much as Republicans, and that is an important factor in Pennsylvania’s 7th district. Biden won this eastern district by less than a point in 2020 and it includes Northampton County, which had the narrowest margin of any in the state that year.Incumbent Democratic Rep. Susan Wild is financially dominant, with $7.5 million in campaign spending this cycle to GOP rival and state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie’s $1.2 million. The district moves from Toss Up to Lean D.Money is also a big part of the story in Illinois’ 17th district and Indiana’s 1st district. Democratic incumbents in these races have spent at least three times as much as their Republican opponents. These seats move from Lean D to Likely D.The cash is flowing in Arizona’s 2nd district too. Incumbent GOP Rep. Eli Crane faces a challenge from Democrat and former President of the Navajo Nation Jonathan Nez in this disproportionately Native American district. Nez has dropped $3.7 million on the race and is focusing on his work with Trump on water access. Crane, meanwhile, is highlighting the border. The 2nd district moves from Solid R to Likely R.Virginia’s 7th district is more competitive than ever. Democrats have fielded Eugene Vindman, a Navy veteran, while Republicans are looking for a flip with attorney Derrick Anderson. The campaign has been marked by mini-scandals on both sides, but Vindman does not have the strong centrist brand that retiring Democrat Abigail Spanberger built. This district moves from Lean D to Toss Up.Keep an eye on Indiana’s governor raceSo far, there have only been three competitive governor’s races on the map and New Hampshire is the one to watch.In Indiana, Republican gubernatorial candidate Sen. Mike Braun should have been able to cruise to victory against any Democratic opponent.But Braun’s hardline position on abortion has given Democrat Jennifer McCormick an opening. The state enacted a near total ban on abortion two years ago, which McCormick argues is too extreme. Braun maintains that Indiana should be a ""right-to-life state.""There are also unusual partisan dynamics at play. The GOP’s candidate for lieutenant governor could impact support for the Republican ticket among moderates, and there is a Libertarian on the ballot.Indiana’s governor race moves from Solid R to Likely R.One week until election nightNo matter who reaches 270 votes next week, the winner will be the American people.The United States is not the only democracy, but it is the most powerful. Estimates suggest that at least 160 million voters will cast a ballot by Election Day. They will have the remarkable power to choose the leader of the free world and the direction of the country.Fox News' Democracy '24 special coverage with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum begins next Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET from New York City.Coverage will include the latest race calls from the Fox News Decision Desk and results from the Fox News Voter Analysis.",29-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-rankings-arizona-trumps-lose-election-anyones-win
Trump vs. Harris: Cities across US board up ahead of election,"Business owners across the United States are boarding up their windows in preparation for potential post-election fallout. Before voters head to the polls Tuesday with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris vying for the presidency, several businesses in Washington, D.C., were boarded up last week near the intersection of 17th Street NW and H Street NW, Fox 5 D.C. reported – a short walk from the White House. On the other side of the country, business owners in Portland, Oregon, who were hit hard by violence following the 2016 election and protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in 2020, are also preparing for potential riots. ""It is completely ridiculous that we have to do this,"" downtown Portland employee Ebony Boger told ABC 7 News. ""It's very precautionary, and I see why because I was here four years ago, and it was crazy down here. It's not shocking. I'm kind of used to it. I think they should do it.""""Hopefully no riots. Nobody wants to see anyone get hurt or any damage. After what happened last time, I guess, you have to be prepared for anything so, like I said, better safe than sorry,"" Stacy Snyder told the outlet.Protests after former President Trump won the 2016 election lasted about a week in the Oregon city, and even led to the shutdown of Interstate 5. U.S. Capitol Police will switch to what they call ""enhanced posture,"" which will include additional officers and ""bike rack"" fencing around the White House. The U.S. Secret Service said it ""is working closely with our federal, state and local partners in Washington, D.C. and Palm Beach County, Florida to ensure the heightened levels of safety and security this Election Day.""""In the coming days, fencing and other physical public safety measures will be installed around the Naval Observatory, White House, and the Palm Beach County Convention Center,"" the agency said Monday. ""These enhancements are not in response to any specific issue but are part of wide-ranging public safety preparations for Tuesday's election.""Portland Police Chief Bob Day told KATU 2 that he is ""really hopeful that [police intervention is] not going to be necessary.""""We never can eliminate risk, but the confidence that I have in our community, the confidence I have in our law enforcement response, I'm really hopeful that that's not going to be necessary,"" Day said.Some Portland business owners told KOIN 6 News that they were adding extra security in preparation, while others said that they were carrying on business as usual.Retail store owners told the outlet that they may pull expensive items off the shelves, and that they were hiring overnight security on Nov. 5 for election night. Some of them said they were not worried about the prospect of unrest until they heard about ballot box fires set this year.""We had already installed, a few months back, security glass over our regular windows. That’s extra thick. Harder to break. We’re hoping that that is repellent,"" Hunny Beez owner Andrew Wegman told KOIN 6. Although they started their business after 2020, he said that surrounding business owners suggested additional measures.Grand Gesture Books owner Katherine Morgan told KATU 2 that she did not intend to fortify her building, saying she hopes any potential rioters will leave her business alone. ""I’m someone who believes in protesting, I’m someone who believes in doing whatever you can for your voice to be heard,"" she said.""When I got the business, the windows were boarded up because of the protest, and they just never came down. For me, if people choose to riot, I feel like we need to listen to the people,"" she continued. ""People won’t listen sometimes unless you resort to causing a commotion, and if causing a commotion is how the word gets out and people express themselves, who am I to be like, ‘Oh, no! This isn’t the right way!’""Asked about boarded up businesses, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said last week that ""people have certain risk tolerances, and I don't think they should be boarding up their buildings, but we're not going to give them that advice,"" Fox 5 D.C. reported.But people who spoke to Fox 5 D.C. outside some of the boarded-up businesses last week did not share her collected attitude. ""Probably think it's a good idea, in case things go bad,"" Christian Bevans told the outlet.Desiree Medina said she was concerned about the prospect of violence, ""given what happened last time,"" Fox 5 D.C. reported.""Who thought that would happen on January 6th? It was like something out of a movie! Who thought that would happen?"" she said.Former D.C. homicide detective and Fox News contributor Ted Williams, who has lived in the capital on and off for the past four decades, told Fox News Digital that he has ""never seen it as bad as it is now when it comes to whether there is going to be some attack of dissension during the inaugural [period] or presidential elections.""""It is very concerning and alarming. Businesses should board up [and] take proactive positions to protect their business,"" he said. ""We're in a very volatile time in this country… I think you could clearly find someone acting out under the circumstances here. I think it's good for them to be proactive… irrespective of what the mayor [of the District of Columbia] says.""When you look at all of these buildings that have been boarded up or you see the fences put around the Capitol, you ask yourself, ‘Is this America? Is this the America that we knew as children? Is this the America that we want our children to know? Is this America, or are we in some Third World country?’""",4-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-vs-harris-cities-across-us-board-up-ahead-election
Stefanik in contention for Trump administration job,"House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is in contention for a role in the new Trump administration, Fox News Digital is told.Stefanik became the first congressional leader to back President-elect Trump’s third White House campaign when she endorsed him in November 2022.She is now being discussed as a potential candidate for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, two people familiar with such discussions told Fox News Digital.One said Stefanik was ""high on the list"" of potential candidates.However, for Stefanik and other House lawmakers in contention for Trump administration roles, their chances will depend heavily on where the majority falls in their chamber.Republicans are bullish about keeping the House majority after victories in the Senate and the White House on election night. However, the outcome will likely come down to a handful of close races in California, Arizona, Alaska and Oregon — and both sides anticipate the margin being close.Replacing a House member, even one from a district that heavily favors one party or the other, generally takes at least several weeks. Additionally, Republican leaders have already signaled they would not want to waste any time in using their majorities in Congress to forward Trump’s agenda.It is not immediately clear who else is in contention for the U.N. ambassador role.Stefanik would have familiarity with foreign affairs as a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Armed Services Committee.The New York Republican has been a vocal supporter of Israel since the Oct. 7 terror attack by Hamas. She is also one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, having headlined multiple ""Women for Trump"" rallies and other events for him on the campaign trail.Stefanik announced to House colleagues on Thursday that she is running for her current leadership role as chair of the House GOP conference again.Stefanik’s office did not return a request for comment from Fox News Digital.Notably, one of Trump’s prior U.N. ambassadors was Nikki Haley, who challenged the president-elect for the 2024 Republican nomination before dropping out and eventually endorsing him.Fox News Digital was also told that another House member, retired Green Beret Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., is in consideration for a Trump administration role. Waltz is being looked at as a potential candidate for defense secretary, though Trump is also considering options from the private sector and others, Fox News Digital was told.In addition to serving in the military before coming to Congress, Waltz was an adviser to Defense Secretaries Robert Gates and Donald Rumsfeld and spent time in the private sector as CEO of defense contractor Metis Solutions.He is currently on the House Armed Services and Intelligence committees with Stefanik, in addition to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Waltz’s office did not respond to an email requesting comment.Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital when asked for comment about the possible appointments, ""President-Elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second Administration soon. Those decisions will be announced when they are made.""",8-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/stefanik-contention-trump-administration-job
The one reason Trump won that Democrats cannot admit,"Democrats and their media enablers are trying to make sense of last Tuesday’s election – the biggest shift to the right since Ronald Reagan became president in 1980 – searching for where they went wrong. The good news for the GOP is that they haven’t got a clue.The main disconnect is that they fail to acknowledge that tens of millions of Americans actually like Donald Trump; many even love him. Democrats are so blinded by hatred (there’s a reason that Republicans have coined the TDS label) they literally cannot fathom that Trump is personally popular. The reasons for that affection in a moment, but first it is worthwhile (and, frankly, fun) to explore the self-flagellation and circular firing squads taking place on the Left.Many Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, are blaming Joe Biden for not dropping out sooner. Others have dared suggest that Kamala Harris ran a lousy billion-dollar campaign by, for example, declining Joe Rogan’s podcast invitation which might have upped her performance among men. (Donald Trump’s free-flowing three-hour conversation with Rogan was watched by 47 million people; as Trump cheekily pointed out in a post offering to help Harris pay off her campaign debts, he got plenty of ""Earned Media"" which ""doesn’t cost very much."") Bernie Sanders is rightly blaming his colleagues for forgetting their roots, saying ""It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.""  Yes, when you vow to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to pay off student loans, and only 34% of Americans are college graduates who typically out-earn non-college grads, you should not be shocked that most of the country thinks you don’t care much about them.All those reflections may be somewhat valid, unlike charges of misogyny or racism, but it is astonishing that not one Democrat has admitted that the genuine appeal of Donald Trump also helped him win.  Liberals have so bought their own narrative about the president-elect, and live in such a cocoon of groupthink, that they cannot conceive that he might be the kind of guy people would like to have a beer with. More importantly, they cannot imagine that he might not be a reflection of our country’s worst impulses and attitudes but instead embodies some of our best.  What would those admirable impulses be? Honesty, common sense, patriotism, humor and authenticity.Let’s start with honesty. Democrats accuse Trump of lying about everything, all the time. They have made a cottage industry of fact-checking his every utterance, every facial expression, every sneeze. What do they find? A tendency to exaggerate, to overstate the size of his crowds, to puff up his wins and minimize his losses. His is a great, big, beautiful world and those are the terms he deals in. His overstatements and hyperbole are often tongue-in-cheek and amusing, but only to his supporters. To Democrats, they are disqualifying.By contrast, Democrats have been authors of some of the greatest and gravest falsehoods in our history. Pretending Joe Biden was fit to serve another four years was an outright lie spun by the White House, leading Democrats and the media. That is a consequential lie, and they are now paying for it.In addition, the left-wing media and Hillary Clinton’s campaign cooked up the undermining Russia hoax, while Democrats also smeared the former president with dishonest interpretations of his comments about Charlottesville, about veterans and immigrants. These profound mistruths unfairly colored what many thought about Trump. Even in the final days of the campaign, Democrats took a stupid joke from Trump’s Madison Square Garden event and dishonestly pretended it reflected the former president’s racism. Supporters knew better.The Left has branded Trump anti-female despite his record of hiring women for important posts (including his daughter Ivanka), anti-gay even though he chose the first openly-gay cabinet member in our history and anti-black despite his adopting measures like permanently funding the historically black colleges and setting up opportunity zones in black communities. These are false charges and dismissed accordingly by his fans.Another Trump virtue applauded by and shared with his supporters is common sense. Allowing biological men to compete in women’s sports is ridiculous; over 70% of adults agree. Allowing millions of people to enter the country illegally, unvetted, is outrageous; a poll that favored Harris shows a majority of the country approves of mass deportations. Allowing criminals to walk free is dangerous; even the voters in ultra-liberal Southern California agree and booted progressive DA George Gascon in a landslide. Common-sense voters chose Donald Trump to stop the progressive nonsense, like prioritizing DEI practices in the military, and he will.Liberals cannot comprehend that Trump is authentic. You may not like what he says, but it’s pretty clear that he is telling you what he thinks. Polling showed that voters thought Trump meant what he said; that was not true for Kamala Harris. Finally, Trump has an excellent sense of humor, something his fans enjoy, the media never displayed and the left never appreciated. Showing up at McDonald's and driving around in a garbage truck late in the campaign was funny and appealing. It was extremely difficult to square those gestures with the Left’s desperate portrayal of Trump as authoritarian and the second coming of Hitler.Finally, Trump is a patriot. Democrats tried to climb aboard that train at their convention, which was festooned with American flags and punctuated by renditions of the Star Spangled Banner. But since the left for years has decried our nation as ""systemically racist,"" has rewritten our history to defame our country’s brilliant Founders, and has denied that the U.S. is a land of opportunity and promise for all, their conversion came across as inauthentic as their candidate.When Donald Trump promises to Make America Great Again, the left sneers. Voters believe him and have given him a mandate to try.",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-reason-trump-won-democrats-cannot-admit
Trump clinched a higher percentage of Muslim voters compared to Jewish voters in recent election,"Despite rhetoric and a track record that would suggest a strong preference for Israel over the Palestinian cause, President-elect Donald Trump lost the Jewish vote by a larger margin than he lost the Muslim vote. Thirty-four percentage points separated Trump from Vice President Kamala Harris among Jewish voters, according to Fox News Voter Analysis. Harris won their support 66% to 32%. Despite Republican attempts to paint Democrats as inconsistent on Israel, Jewish voters only narrowly shifted toward Trump. In 2020, 69% voted for President Biden, 30% voted for Trump. Muslim voters favored Harris by 32 percentage points. Trump won 32% of their vote, while Harris won 63%. In 2020, Biden had won 64% of the Muslim vote, and Trump had won 35%. Trump won a majority of the vote among evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons. Some Democrats had worried that third-party candidate Jill Stein could pull the vote of Muslims and others disaffected with Biden’s Middle East policy away from Harris. Four percent of Muslims voted for a third-party candidate.Throughout the campaign, Harris tried to walk a tightrope between both sides as Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza dragged on and spilled into Lebanon. She refused to differentiate herself from Biden’s Middle East policy and emphasized that she was committed to Israel’s right to defend itself. Harris has called for a cease-fire for many months and refused to preside over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress in April. ""This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza,"" Harris said last month when Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. She said the war ""must end such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.""""It is time for the day after to begin,"" she said.To Palestinian supporters in the U.S., Biden’s criticisms of Israel’s offensive campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon ring hollow when the U.S. continues to provide aid without conditions to the war effort. The Biden team threatened to withhold military aid in October if Israel did not allow more food aid into Gaza but largely continued to provide weapons packages to Israel as the war dragged past the one-year mark last month. In May, Netanyahu accused the Biden administration of slow-walking delivery of 2,000-pound bombs due to concerns over their destructive capabilities. ""One of the things that we’ve done that I’m entirely supportive of is the pause that we put on the 2000-lb. bombs,"" Harris told the National Association of Black Journalists in September. The Trump team, meanwhile, worked to capitalize on Arab American disillusionment with the Biden administration. ""We have to get this whole thing over with,"" Trump said in Dearborn, Michigan, last week, speaking of the continuing conflict in the Middle East. ""We want to have peace. We want to have peace on earth.""On the other hand, Trump has said that for a Jewish American not to vote for him ""shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.""During his first term, Trump moved the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and helped broker peace deals between Israel and four Arab countries.His campaign frequently suggested that Harris favors the Palestinian cause over the Israelis. However, in April, Trump told radio host Hugh Hewitt ""Israel is absolutely losing the PR war"" and criticized the images being shown of Gaza in ruins. ""You’ve got to get it over with, and you have to get back to normalcy. And I’m not sure that I’m loving the way they’re doing it, because you’ve got to have victory,"" Trump said, without directly answering whether he was ""100 percent with Israel.""",8-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-won-muslim-vote-larger-margin-than-jewish-vote
"Trump expected to end Biden-era death penalty pause, expand to more federal inmates","President-elect Donald Trump put federal death row inmates on notice this campaign season, when he warned he would undo a moratorium on executions slapped in place under the outgoing Biden-Harris administration.""President-elect Trump has not shied away from using the death penalty,"" said Matt Mangino, a former district attorney for Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, and an expert on capital punishment. ""He presided over 13 executions in the final year of his first term.""However, the incoming president also says he wants to expand capital punishment for other crimes, putting execution on the table for child rapists, human traffickers and illegal immigrants who kill Americans or police officers.That would require support from Congress and the Supreme Court.Some of those ideas face hurdles. In 2008, the Supreme Court declared the death penalty for child rapists unconstitutional when the child survives, the American Bar Journal reported Monday.However, with Trump in the White House, a Republican majority in the Senate and conservatives holding a 6-3 advantage in the current Supreme Court, proponents are hopeful for a reversal.""The Supreme Court has said the death penalty should only apply when the death of the victim is involved, but that is subject to change with the makeup of the current Supreme Court,"" Mangino told Fox News Digital.Three of the four justices who dissented in the 2008 Kennedy v. Louisiana decision are still on the court – Justices John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.It would also be a groundbreaking move to impose the death penalty on people convicted of drug or human trafficking, Mangino said.""The death penalty for drug and human trafficking would be unprecedented in the western world,"" he said. Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, prompted an international outcry after a violent war on drugs in his Southeast Asian country, he noted.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has vowed to fight efforts to expand the death penalty.In July, the organization noted that in the 1980s, Trump paid for a full-page ad calling for the execution of the ""Central Park Five"" – who were convicted of rape and assault for an attack in the park. New York state had no law authorizing the death penalty for rape cases at the time and banned capital punishment altogether in 2004.More than a decade after their wrongful convictions, all five were exonerated by DNA evidence. One of them, Yusef Salaam, is currently a New York City councilman.There are currently 40 federal inmates on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, and the list includes surviving Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Dylann Roof, who massacred nine parishioners in a South Carolina church.Justice Department records show the federal government has executed 16 people since 2001, with the deaths of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and, eight days later, the American drug trafficker Juan Raul Garza, who had two men killed and executed a third himself.Thirteen of those executions came during Trump's first term in office.The individual states executed 1,542 condemned inmates between 1977 and 2022, according to federal data. Texas led the way with 587 executions, more than the next two states combined – Oklahoma with 119 and Virginia with 113.In almost that same time period – between 1973 and 2023 – 192 death row inmates were exonerated and set free, according to the ACLU.The individual states have their own system for capital punishment – or lack thereof – and would not be as impacted by Trump administration policy.""Trump will have a GOP Senate and most likely a GOP House,"" Mangino said. ""He can do a lot with the death penalty and only the Supreme Court can put on the brakes – and how likely is that?""",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-expected-end-biden-era-death-penalty-pause-expand-more-federal-inmates
"Thune wins secret ballot to become new Senate GOP leader, succeeding McConnell","Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., will be the new Republican Senate leader and the majority leader of the upper chamber in the new Congress. In January, he will succeed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is the longest-serving party leader in Senate history. ""I am extremely honored to have earned the support of my colleagues to lead the Senate in the 119th Congress, and I am beyond proud of the work we have done to secure our majority and the White House,"" Thune said in a statement. ""This Republican team is united behind President Trump's agenda, and our work starts today.""Sources told Fox News Digital that no candidate reached a majority during the first secret ballot in the old Senate chamber on Wednesday morning. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., received the least amount of votes and was knocked out of the race. The second secret ballot was between only Thune and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.""I am excited to work with this team and get to work right away,"" Thune told reporters shortly after his win.Thune received 29 votes and Cornyn got 24 on the second ballot, according to Thune’s office.Each of the candidates made a final pitch to their fellow Republican senators late Tuesday night during a forum held by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.Joining Thune in leadership are Sens. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., as assistant majority leader; Tom Cotton, R-Ark., as Republican conference chair; Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., as Republican Policy Committee chair; James Lankford, R-Okla., as Republican conference vice chair; and Tim Scott, R-S.C., as National Republican Senatorial Committee chair.Scott walked out of the meeting with two new public endorsements from both Lee and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. A source familiar told Fox News Digital that Blackburn had asked multiple questions during the discussion, including ""how they would give conservatives a more meaningful voice in the Senate and for specific details as to how they would immediately implement President Trump’s mass deportation operation.""Despite this, one source with knowledge told Fox News Digital that Scott's pitch didn't convince everyone. ""Scott’s remarks didn’t do much to impress or sway members,"" they said. ""He focused more on his time as a businessman instead of priorities for the Senate.""Prior to the elections, Thune had received public endorsements from Sens. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla.; Mike Rounds, R-S.D.; Kevin Cramer, R-N.D.; and John Hoeven, R-N.D., and a source confirmed to Fox News Digital that National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Steve Daines, R-Mont., was privately encouraging other senators to support Thune. Scott had the most public support, with Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.; and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also backing him. Cornyn had only received one public endorsement from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.The majority of GOP senators did not disclose ahead of time who they were casting their ballots for.Rubio and Hagerty gave the two nominating speeches for Scott, while Daines and Rounds did so for Thune.

Democrats have an enormous dilemma if Kamala Harris loses,"Changing leaves, the World Series, Halloween, the New York City Marathon. Then, in a blink, Election Day. The classic quadrennial late-fall cycle in America.  Now it’s the final stretch, the final sprint. The race currently seems so tight, it is impossible to predict with confidence who will win, or what ultimately will be the deciding factors for the voters. Yet in a few short days, we will likely know the answer. Then Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah , Christmas, New Year’s, and at last, Inauguration Day. On January 20, 2025, the next POTUS will take office. Former President Donald Trump may return to the West Wing, or we may greet President Kamala Harris as Number 47. Harris, in her brief race to the White House, has achieved many impressive feats. In a blast of summer joy, she energized the Democratic Party. She held court over thousands of citizens in jam-packed rallies around the country. She looked both confident and glam at the debate against Trump. She raised over a billion dollars in support, grandly outpacing Trump’s own imposing fundraising effort. Millions of Americans will enthusiastically cast their ballot for the vice president. If Harris wins, there would be celebration in the blue streets, excitement about the historic first female American president, and hope that Harris would bring to the Oval Office a refreshing mix of energy, leadership, unity and smart new ideas.  There would, of course, be those who would worry about her habit of creating toxic workplaces for notoriously discontented staffers; her long-running failure to stem the influx of migrants at the southern border; her largely unpopular stance on transgender issues, and the uncertainty still surrounding many of her key positions and international steel. Others would be more generous and encourage their fellow Americans to give Harris a chance to acclimate to the top job and take her shot at becoming one of the greats. Meanwhile, there would be complicated feelings on the other side. Trump voters would be disappointed, crushed, angry, stoic, resigned, disruptive, or, perhaps, sanguine. Some might blame a blatantly biased press, electoral mischief, Trump derangement syndrome, or the candidate himself for being too chaotic, too volatile, too rhetorically undisciplined, too past his prime.  Most red voters, however, would get on with the business of their lives, even as they proudly wear their MAGA hats and buy Trump buttons and other vintage merch to pass down to their grandchildren. They would continue to vote Republican and keep a close eye on the likely party majority in the Senate, along with JD Vance, Nikki Haley, and any MAGA candidates Trump chooses to support. But for the blue voters, if Harris loses the election and Trump returns to the White House, there would be a seismic, convulsive uproar of angst and censure within the Democratic Party that would resonate from coast to coast. There would be much to blame, and many to blame, and the accusations would be flung far and wide, with fury and fervor. The first person to be placed in the dunking machine would be … not Kamala Harris, but President Joe Biden. For staying in the race too long, only leaving when it was indefensible for him to continue after his disastrous June debate. For running for president back in 2020, when it was clear to some that his mental acuity was already in decline, and that the prospect of a long-term presidential career was untenable. For blocking other viable Democrats from running, curbing the growth and potential of his party’s future leadership. For picking Harris as his running mate for crass demographic reasons, and for covering up unsavory truths about his family, especially his son, Hunter. For choosing self-interest and vanity over country, putting an egotistical desire to remain in power over the needs of the party and the nation. Even those who might dispute these claims, and argue that Biden was acting with integrity and fortitude when he ran in 2020 and 2024, convinced he was the only person who could beat Trump (which may be proven correct this go-round, despite his deterioration), would lay some of the debris at Biden’s feet. Second in line for blame would be Harris. For taking that summer burst of joy and hope and mangling it with word salads and a refusal to answer basic questions or properly prepare for and perform at important interviews.  For declining to clarify her most fundamental policy positions; for not sending sufficient signals to the center of the electorate that she understands where her party has gone too far;  for not mastering the politics of appeal to Hispanics, young Black men, or Arab-, Muslim-, and Jewish-Americans; and for inexplicably maintaining an unusually light schedule for a young, hale candidate unfettered by funding issues or a pandemic. And, if she loses Pennsylvania, for not having the fortitude and clarity to choose the Keystone State’s popular Governor Josh Shapiro as her running mate. Next, blame would be placed on a liberal agenda, one that wandered off the smooth, paved road of enlightenment, stumbled through the weeds, and then tangled itself in the brambles of extreme, almost irrational, thought, causing even yellow dog Democrats to get a little orange. Some Democratic voters, astonished and bewildered, say they no longer recognize the party they grew up with, while many loyal donors are on full alert that their funds would someday be responsible for allowing young children to unwittingly have their genders reassigned or the Middle East to be fully controlled by terrorist groups.  Alternatively, and contradictorily, blame also would be cast by the AOC wing of the party, who would charge that their fellow Democrats have in fact been too meek, lacking the conviction to push boldly and decisively into a new era of full-blown progressive change and populist economics. In addition to blame, there would be a profound reckoning about how the Democratic Party lost its mainstream appeal. Once it offered a home to a wide spectrum of voters (fiscal conservatives, progressives, bipartisan moderates, lefties) while embracing classic American tenets such as tolerance, free speech, patriotism and a global helping hand. There was a tangible pride in its representation of the old and the young, the well-heeled and the up-and-coming, the patriarchs and the new arrivals.  Now it is fragmented and disordered, plagued by infighting, resentment and second-guessing, resembling a dog with a flea on its tail, chasing itself, circling, biting, without calm or cohesion, or a fresh mainstream policy agenda.  And, of course, as much as Democrats are loath to admit it, or even think about it, Trump has taken advantage of their move to the far left to take more of the ground in the political center than they could have ever imagined.In the past, when faced with setbacks, the Democratic Party has found ways to right itself, correct course and learn from its mistakes, unquestionably with assists from generational political talents such as Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who were able to synthesize the critiques, move the party back into a zone of health and inspire confidence from leaders and civilians on both sides of the aisle after a White House loss.  Clinton, in particular, along with other party thinkers at the Democratic Leadership Council, made an effort to appeal to all Americans after a string of presidential campaign losses culminating in Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis’ defeat at the hands of President George H.W. Bush.   Clinton took stances both bold and nuanced on policies such as right to work, welfare reform, the death penalty and free trade, positions that were a shock to many on the far left, but that reflected an effort to understand the other side and speak to all citizens as a united entity. He gave his party a new, winning direction, a path they largely stayed on until the rise of Biden and Harris. But for the blue voters, if Harris loses the election and Trump returns to the White House, there would be a seismic, convulsive uproar of angst and censure within the Democratic Party that would resonate from coast to coast. There would be much to blame, and many to blame, and the accusations would be flung far and wide, with fury and fervor. But in 2024, the Democrats are in far deeper denial about their party’s identity than they have been in the modern era. How far left it has gone, how unstable and unreliable many perceive it to be, How and why Trump has dominated American politics for a decade and counting.If Kamala Harris wins, she would step into the role as president for all Americans, a responsibility she undoubtedly is qualified to undertake. The Democratic Party, then, would have some breathing space to figure out how to create its own comprehensive appeal, and determine a viable path for the future of the brand. But if Harris loses, Democrats in Washington and around the country would have an enormous task: they would have to find a way to salvage the party and come to terms with its fractured identity and significant disillusionment from its base, all while dealing with fallout from the election, preparing for political combat against Donald Trump, and managing a collective mental health crisis from its disillusioned cohorts. And if Harris loses, this would be the Democrats’ biggest problem: there would be zero consensus in the party about what went wrong – and thus zero consensus about what the proper solutions should be, and, therefore, zero consensus about which leaders should be empowered to bring the party back to power. All we do know is that, under those circumstances, it almost certainly won’t be Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.

Election night winners and losers: 2024 edition,"In the wake of former President Trump's historic win projected by the Fox News Decision Desk, several winners and losers of the 2024 election have become clear.Here are those who came out on top on Election Day and those who didn't quite meet expectations.WinnersTrumpTrump defied all expectations, even some of the more conservative-leaning estimates of the 2024 election. By notable margins, Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in several key battleground states, being projected by the Fox News Decision Desk to win the election by amassing the necessary 270 electoral votes before a number of other top swing states had been called.Republicans Trump's top of the ticket projected victory was followed by significant victories for Republicans across the board. Senate Republicans were projected by the Fox News Decision Desk to retake the majority in the Senate in 2025, racking up wins in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, which were previously blue. There are still multiple outstanding Senate races in swing states, giving the party hope for an even larger majority. LosersChuck Schumer Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is one of the biggest losers in this particular election, as voters decisively removed his party from the majority in the upper chamber. He will instead lead the minority in the new Congress. Democrats suffered projected losses in West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, effectively killing any chance they had of keeping the majority. They also failed to flip any of their Republican targets, such as Texas or Florida. There are still several Senate races in swing states yet to be called that could increase the GOP's majority over them.PollstersPolitical polls failed to accurately predict the projected decisive victory Trump saw in the 2024 election. The RealClearPolitics polling averages underestimated the former president, putting him behind Harris in swing states that he was projected to win and showing Trump leading by a smaller margin than he ultimately did in other battlegrounds. A respected Iowa pollster's results predicted the state would be led by Harris, and ended up being off by double digits as Trump took Iowa.DemocratsAs a whole, the Democratic Party was dealt a devastating blow by voters across the country. Not only was their presidential nominee categorically rejected by the American people, but the implications of that loss further dragged down candidates across the board, per the Fox News Decision Desk's projections. Incumbent senators in some swing states are in battles for their political lives that could take days to resolve. This comes as the party has already lost two blue-held seats in Ohio and Montana. Republicans in the House are also feeling bullish that they could complete the GOP trifecta in Washington, D.C.",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2024-election-night-winners-losers
Shock poll has Harris leading Trump in Iowa with 3-point shift toward vice president in red state,"Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Trump by three points in the final Des Moines Register-sponsored poll of Iowa three days before the election. The shock poll showed a seven-point shift from Trump to Harris from September when he had a four-point lead over the vice president (47% to 43%) in the same poll. ""It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,"" pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., who conducted the poll, told the newspaper on Saturday. ""She has clearly leaped into a leading position."" The poll was conducted between Oct. 28-31, and Harris’ lead is within the 3.4% margin of error. Still, the poll appears to be an outlier. Another poll from Emerson College released Saturday showed Trump with a 10-point lead (53% to 43%) and he maintains a decent lead in other polls. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll, which measures support in the Hawkeye State, is nationally recognized, and its final results mirrored the state's results of the 2016 and 2020 elections, according to the Des Moines Register. The 2016 poll showed Trump with a seven-point lead over Hillary Clinton and the 2020 poll showed him with the same lead over President Biden. Iowa, which is not considered a swing state, is geographically near the Rust Belt swing state of Michigan, and it shares a border with Wisconsin. The same poll taken in June showed Trump with a considerable 18-point lead over Biden before he dropped out of the race in July following a shaky debate performance.The Nov. 2 poll shows Harris increasing her support among women in a race with a historic gender gap as the vice president has made the issue of abortion front and center in her campaign, according to the newspaper. The remaining 9% of the people polled said they would vote for another candidate, weren’t sure who they would vote for or didn’t plan to vote. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who dropped out of the race as an independent candidate and endorsed Trump, got 3% in the poll. Trump's campaign website published a memo about the Des Moines Register's poll, with RNC pollsters calling it a ""clear outlier.""""Emerson College, released today, far more closely reflects the state of the actual Iowa electorate and does so with far more transparency in their methodology,"" the memo read.""To their credit, the Emerson College poll has an R+4 party split (below 2020 exit polls at R+10), and a Trump +8 recalled 2020 vote margin that aligns with reported returns,"" the experts explained. ""Emerson shows Trump ahead of Harris 53-43 in their survey. In the outlier Des Moines Register poll, they claim Harris leads with seniors (age 65+) by 19 points (55-36). In 2020, President Trump carried seniors 54-45 over Biden according to CNN exit polls.""",2-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/shock-poll-harris-leading-trump-iowa-3-point-shift-toward-vice-president-red-state
"Harris tears into Trump, praises Gen Z in closing argument to Georgia voters","Democratic 2024 presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris blasted former President Trump and praised young voters in what was likely her final campaign speech in Georgia.Harris spoke to supporters in downtown Atlanta on Saturday, three days before voters across the country who haven't already cast ballots head to the polls on Election Day.""We have three days left – three days in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime – and we still have work to do,"" the vice president said.She pivoted to attacking Trump just a few minutes into her roughly 22-minute speech.""We have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump, who spends full time trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We're done. We're done with that,"" Harris said. ""This is not someone who is thinking about how to make your life better, this is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance. And the man is out for unchecked power.""She later asked ""young leaders"" to raise their hands and lavished praise on members of Generation Z – a voting bloc that both Republicans and Democrats have fought to win over.""I love Gen Z. I love it,"" Harris said. ""Because, see, this generation, you are rightly impatient for change. You are rightly impatient for change. You are determined to live free from gun violence, and tackle the climate crisis, and shape the world you inherit.""""I see your power. And I am so proud of you.""The speech mined familiar territory, with Harris repeating slogans and promises that she has already uttered on the campaign trail – as is typical of presidential candidates this close to Election Day.She vowed to crack down on grocery price gouging, which critics have panned as attempts at price-controlling goods, and pledged to cut taxes for small businesses.Harris also pledged to lower health care costs and accused Trump of wanting to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), despite his campaign already insisting that is not his policy position.The rally also featured appearances from famed director Spike Lee, rapper 2 Chainz, and both of Georgia’s Democratic U.S. senators.Georgia has smashed turnout records already, with more than four million people casting early in-person or absentee ballots during the early voting period from Oct. 15 through Nov. 1.More than 50% of active voters cast ballots early, including over 700,000 people who did not vote at all in 2020.The counties leading in terms of turnout percentage have been largely rural, Republican-leaning areas. Bluer counties like DeKalb and Fulton, however, have significantly larger populations and have outpaced the redder areas in terms of sheer numbers.Both Harris and Trump have poured enormous resources into Georgia, a state that President Biden won by less than 1% during the previous election cycle.Trump’s campaign criticized Harris’ visit to the Peach State in a statement on Saturday morning.""Kamala Harris' last-ditch attempt to gaslight Georgians and distract them with out of touch liberal Hollywood elites and flashy celebrities shows how desperate she is to distract Georgians from the last four years of her failed policy agenda,"" said Morgan Ackley, a spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign in Georgia.""That's why Georgians are ready to elect President Trump on Tuesday to fix our problems and fire Kamala Harris.""",2-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-tears-trump-praises-gen-z-closing-argument-georgia-voters
White House seeks to play clean up after Biden calls Trump supporters 'garbage',"The White House attempted to walk back President Biden's comments after the president unleashed a firestorm after calling Trump supporters ""garbage.""During a virtual Vice President Kamla Harris campaign call with Voto Latino, Biden took a swipe at former President Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden, which made headlines after insult comedian Tony Hinchiffe made jokes mocking different ethnic groups, with one joke referring to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage.""""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,"" Biden said. ""[Trump's] demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it is un-American.""His remarks were quickly likened to Hillary Clinton’s labeling of half of Trump supporters as belonging in ""a basket of deplorables"" in 2016, a comment that was widely seen as undermining her campaign.White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich that President Biden ""referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage.’""""The president was referencing a joke by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe in which he likened Puerto Rico to an island of floating ‘garbage’ in the middle of the ocean,"" he said.The White House earlier told NBC News that the president was referring to Hinchcliffe.Later, Biden tried to further clarify his comments, saying that he was denouncing Hinchicliffe's comments – not Trump supporters.""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporters at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,"" Biden wrote in a post on X. ""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.""Speaking at a campaign event with Trump on Tuesday in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) picked up Biden's remark as ""breaking news"" and told Trump supporters that Biden had marginalized a huge number of everyday Americans as ""garbage.""Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Biden and Harris ""despise the tens of millions"" who support him.""There's no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don't just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him,"" she wrote in a release. Backlash from the comments came from both sides of the aisle, with Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro condemning Biden's remarks.""I’m giving you my fresh reaction to it,"" he told Fox News Radio Political Analyst Josh Kraushaar on Tuesday.

Justice Department looking to wind down Trump criminal cases ahead of inauguration,"The Justice Department is looking to wind down two federal criminal cases against President-elect Trump as he prepares to be sworn in for a second term in the White House — a decision that upholds long-standing policy that prevents Justice Department attorneys from prosecuting a sitting president. In making this argument, Justice Department officials cited a memo from the Office of Legal Counsel filed in 2000, which upholds a Watergate-era argument that asserts it is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for the Justice Department to investigate a sitting president. It further notes that such proceedings would ""unduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the conduct of the Presidency.""  ""In light of the effect that an indictment would have on the operations of the executive branch, ‘an impeachment proceeding is the only appropriate way to deal with a President while in office,’"" the memo said in conclusion.Former Attorney General Bill Barr also backed this contention Wednesday in an interview with Fox News Digital, noting that after Trump takes office in January, prosecutors will be unable to continue the cases during his term. Barr told Fox News Digital that a Trump-appointed attorney general could immediately halt all federal cases brought by current Special Counsel Jack Smith in Washington, D.C., and Florida. The charges in D.C. stem from Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. In Florida, they are centered on Trump's handling of classified documents after leaving the White House in 2020.And though Trump would be powerless to halt two state cases filed in Georgia and New York, Barr said local prosecutors and judges need to move on from the ""spectacle"" of prosecuting the president-elect.""Further maneuvering on these cases in the weeks ahead would serve no legitimate purpose and only distract the country and the incoming administration from the task at hand,"" Barr said.He also noted that voters were well aware of the criminal allegations against Trump when they voted to re-elect him for a second term.""The American people have rendered their verdict on President Trump, and decisively chosen him to lead the country for the next four years,"" Barr said. ""They did that with full knowledge of the claims against him by prosecutors around the country and I think Attorney General [Merrick] Garland and the state prosecutors should respect the people’s decision and dismiss the cases against President Trump now.""",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/justice-department-looking-wind-down-trump-criminal-cases-ahead-inauguration
Trump confirms Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser pick,"President-elect Trump formerly announced on Tuesday that he selected Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., to join his administration as National Security Adviser. ""Mike is the first Green Beret to have been elected to Congress, and previously served in the White House and Pentagon,"" Trump said in a statement announcing his latest cabinet pick. ""Mike served in the Army Special Forces for 27 years where he was deployed multiple times in combat for which he was awarded four Bronze Stars, including two with Valor.""""Mike retired as a Colonel, and is a nationally recognized leader in National Security, a bestselling author, and an expert on the threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and global terrorism,"" the statement added. ""He serves as a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Mike is a distinguished graduate with honors of the Virginia Military Institute. Mike has been a strong champion of my America First Foreign Policy agenda, and will be a tremendous champion of our pursuit of Peace through Strength!""Fox News Digital initially reported Waltz's selection on Monday night, citing a source familiar with the matter. The move puts Waltz at the forefront of a litany of national security crises — ranging from U.S. weapons supplies to Ukraine and escalating worries about the growing alliance between Russia and North Korea to the persistent attacks in the Middle East by Iran proxies and the push for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist groups.Waltz, a three-term GOP congressman from east-central Florida, was the first Green Beret elected to the U.S. House, and easily won reelection last week. He has been chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on readiness and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.He is considered hawkish on China, and called for a U.S. boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing due to its involvement in the origin of COVID-19 and its ongoing mistreatment of the minority Muslim Uighur population.He has been a sharp critic of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and has called on the U.S. to hold accountable those who bear responsibility for the deaths of the 13 U.S. service members at Abbey Gate and for ""thousands of Americans and allies behind enemy lines."" He has also repeated Trump’s frequent complaints about a""woke"" military that the former president has derided as too focused on diversity and equity programs.In a statement last year, Waltz said that as head of the readiness subcommittee: ""I am ready to get to work to better equip our military and turn our focus away from woke priorities and back to winning wars. Our national security depends on it.""A graduate of Virginia Military Institute, Waltz was a Green Beret. He served in the active-duty Army for four years before moving to the Florida Guard. While in the Guard he did multiple combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa and was awarded four Bronze Stars, including two with valor.

"Matt Gaetz resigns from Congress over Trump nod to be attorney general, Johnson says","Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., resigned from the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced.Gaetz gave House GOP leaders his resignation notice on the same day President-elect Donald Trump tapped him to be his attorney general, Johnson said.""I think out of deference to us, he issued his resignation letter effective immediately,"" Johnson said. ""That caught us by surprise a little bit. But I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, well, you can't have too many absences.""The speaker pointed out that Florida state law gave the governor ""about an eight-week period"" to fill a House vacancy and that by doing so, ""we may be able to fill that seat as early as Jan. 3.""Johnson said he's already in contact with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on the matter.Speaking with reporters after internal House GOP leadership elections, Johnson said Trump had informed him about his decision to tap Gaetz for the Department of Justice (DOJ) earlier on Wednesday morning.He's the third House Republican Trump has tapped for his new administration, after picking Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., for National Security Adviser (NSA).Trump's two earlier selections prompted concerns about thinning out an already-meager likely majority for the House GOP in the 119th Congress.But Gaetz resigning early likely alleviates some of those concerns.However, out of the three House members chosen, Gaetz likely faces the highest hurdle to get the job.The NSA role is not Senate confirmed, and Stefanik's appointment already received bipartisan praise.But multiple Republican senators have already signaled they have some heartburn over Gaetz, an outspoken bomb-thrower who was previously under a yearlong DOJ investigation stemming from accusations he had a sexual relationship with a minor. The DOJ ultimately did not press charges.""He will never get confirmed,"" a Republican senator, granted anonymity to speak freely, told Fox News Digital. One Senate Republican source simply said, ""Ain’t gonna happen,"" about the prospect of Gaetz's confirmation. The announcement came during House Republicans' leadership elections. One lawmaker told Fox News Digital there were ""audible gasps"" in the room when the news broke. When nominating him, however, Trump lauded Gaetz as ""a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney"" who ""will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans’ badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.""House GOP leaders including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., similarly praised the appointment.Fox News Digital reached out to Gaetz to confirm his resignation.",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/matt-gaetz-resigns-from-congress-over-trump-nod-attorney-general-johnson-says
Donald Trump wears garbage worker vest to rally in critical swing state,"Just six days until Nov. 5 and the day after President Biden called Trump supporters ""garbage,"" Former President Donald Trump addressed several thousand supporters in Green Bay, Wisconsin, while wearing a garbage worker's high visibility vest.Trump explained that his decision to arrive at the rally in a dump truck, dressed in a garbage vest, was made spur of the moment. He joked that the vest made him look thinner and quipped that the vest could become part of his everyday attire. ""When they said I’d look thinner, I said in that case, I’ll wear it onstage,"" he joked. ""I may never wear a blue jacket again.""  He criticized Biden, Democrats, and most especially his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, for ""running a campaign of hate, vitriol and retribution.""""This week Kamala has been comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history and now speaking on a call for her campaign last night crooked Joe Biden finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters, he called them ‘garbage,'"" he said.Referencing Hillary Clinton’s 2016 comments calling his supporters ""deplorables,"" he said that Biden’s remark ""blows deplorables out of the water.""""My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple: You can’t lead America if you don’t love Americans, it's true.

Trump says goodbye to 'big beautiful rallies' in last event before election,"Former President Donald Trump bid farewell to his trademark rallies during an early morning stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan, his last event on the 2024 campaign trail.""Your support means more than anything you can even understand… this is my last rally, can you believe it? The rallies, these big beautiful rallies, there’s never been anything like it and there never will be,"" Trump told supporters at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan at a rally in the early morning hours on Tuesday.The comments come after a whirlwind day for Trump, who wrapped up his 2024 campaign with stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.The former president didn’t take the stage in Grand Rapids until after midnight Tuesday, meaning Trump spoke to supporters at his last event on election day in his final pitch to be sent back to the White House.Trump’s Grand Rapids event marked the third time the former president ended his campaign in the West Michigan city, having concluded his former runs at DeVos Place in Grand Rapids in 2016 and the city’s airport in 2020.The event also signified how critical of a prize the swing state of Michigan would be for his White House bid, a state where both campaigns have combined to double the number of events and visits that were held there in 2016 and 2020.Trump was able to narrowly capture the state in his race against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, but then lost it to President Biden in another nail-biter in 2020. Michigan promises to play a similar role in determining who ultimately wins in 2024, joining the states of Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as the critical battlegrounds in this year’s election.Trump, who has said this will be his last campaign even if he were to lose to Vice President Kamala Harris, at times struck a reflective tone during the Grand Rapids event, thanking supporters in Michigan who have supported him through three runs for president.""You’re really incredible people,"" Trump said..

Teary-eyed Nancy Pelosi arrives to see Kamala Harris concede presidential race at Howard University,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., appeared somber and teary-eyed while waiting to see defeated candidate Vice President Kamala Harris make a concession speech on Wednesday.Arriving at Howard University in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday afternoon, Pelosi was photographed greeting Harris supporters while appearing tearful. In a particularly emotional picture, Pelosi pouted as if just about to weep, and had watery eyes. Other pictures showed Pelosi smiling at the event and mingling with attendees.Harris' concession speech comes after a historic neck-and-neck presidential race ended with a victory for former President Trump early Wednesday morning. While the election was expected to be a toss-up, the scope of Trump's victory shocked both sides of the political aisle.Pelosi and Trump have a great deal of enmity towards each other, regularly insulting each other in public. During a speech in Grand Rapids, Michigan, this week, Trump described Pelosi as something that ""starts with a B.""""She's an evil, sick, crazy—,"" the Republican candidate said, stopping short. ""It starts with a ‘B,’ but I won't say it. I wanna say it.""Pelosi has fired jabs back at Trump in the past, and recently claimed that he was suffering from ""cognitive degeneration"" during a recent appearance on MSNBC.""[Voters] have to know that he can't last as president for four years with his brain deteriorating at the rate that it is… and they may be voting for President Vance, which would be a horrible thing for our country,"" Pelosi claimed.In response, the Trump campaign insulted Pelosi in a statement to Fox News Digital.""The only thing deteriorating is Nancy Pelosi, who is a decrepit washed up corrupt politician who America can no longer stand,"" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

Former Trump aide Steve Bannon released from prison 1 week before Election Day,"Steve Bannon, a former White House aide and longtime ally of former President Trump, was released from prison Tuesday after completing a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.Bannon left the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, federal Bureau of Prisons spokesperson Kristie Breshears told The Associated Press. He is expected to hold a news conference later in the day in Manhattan, according to his representatives. He also is expected to resume his ""War Room"" podcast on Tuesday.Bannon, 70, was jailed in July after the Supreme Court rejected his attempt to delay the prison sentence while he appeals his conviction.A jury found Bannon guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's reported efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race.Bannon told reporters in July he was ""proud"" to begin his prison sentence and described himself as a ""political prisoner."" ""I am going to prison. I’m proud to go to prison. I am proud of going to prison today,"" Bannon said at a press conference held with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., outside the prison. ""I am proud to go to prison. If this is what it takes to stand up to tyranny. If this is what it takes to stand up to the Garland corrupt, criminal DOJ. If this is what it takes to stand up to Nancy Pelosi, if this is what it takes to stand up to Joe Biden, I’m proud to do it.""Bannon's release comes one week before Election Day, when Trump, a Republican, will seek to defeat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and return to the White House.A federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon's convictions in May. Bannon is now asking the full appeals court to hear his case. His legal team had argued that the congressional subpoena was invalid because Trump had asserted executive privilege. Prosecutors, though, say Bannon had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked executive privilege in front of the committee.Bannon also faces criminal charges in New York state court, where prosecutors allege he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Banon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges. He is set to go to trial in December.

Trump campaign blasts top Harris surrogate Mark Cuban for 'insulting' pro-Trump women,"The Trump campaign is blasting billionnaire Mark Cuban, a top surrogate for Vice President Kamala Harris, for ""extremely insulting"" comments against women who support former President Trump, demanding the vice president ""immediately condemn"" his remarks. Cuban appeared on ABC’s ""The View"" on Thursday morning when he made the comments. ""Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women. Ever,"" Cuban said. ""It’s just that simple. They're intimidating to him. He doesn't like to be challenged by them."" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed Cuban's comments. ""Joe Biden called Trump supporters ‘garbage,’ and now Kamala’s top surrogate Mark Cuban insinuated female Trump supporters are ‘weak and dumb,’"" Leavitt told Fox News Digital.""This is extremely insulting to the thousands of women who work for President Trump, and the tens of millions of women who are voting for him,"" Leavitt said. ""These women are mothers, entrepreneurs, and industry leaders, and they are, indeed, strong and intelligent, despite what Mark Cuban and Kamala Harris say."" Leavitt told Fox News Digital that the ""joy at Kamala HQ has been replaced by division, vitriol, and a disturbing level of disrespect for the millions of Americans who are supporting President Trump after four years of destruction under Kamala Harris."" ""Women want a president who will secure our border, remove violent criminals from our neighborhoods, and put more money in our pockets — and that’s exactly why we are supporting President Trump,"" Leavitt said. ""Kamala Harris must immediately condemn Mark Cuban’s disrespectful insult to women."" The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. The comment comes just days after President Biden apparently referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage."" Biden spoke during a Zoom call with Voto Latino, one of the largest Latino voter and civic outreach organizations in the U.S., on Tuesday. Biden was asked about a comment made Sunday during a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in which comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage.""Biden replied, ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters."" The White House has since denied that Biden called Trump supporters ""garbage"" and claimed the comment was taken out of context.And when asked about Biden's comments, Vice President Kamala Harris said: ""I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for."" ""I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not,"" Harris said. ""And as president of the United States, I will be a president for all Americans, whether you vote for me or not."" Trump, in Wisconsin on Wednesday, drove around in a ""Make America Great Again"" garbage truck, wearing a garbage worker's high-visibility vest to address supporters at his Green Bay rally. ""He called them garbage — and they mean it, even though, without question, my supporters are far higher quality than Crooked Joe and Lyin’ Kamala,"" Trump told supporters Wednesday afternoon.But Trump said he had a response for the president and vice president. ""My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple: You can’t lead America if you don’t love Americans,"" Trump declared. ""And you can’t be president if you hate the American people, and there’s a lot of hatred there.""

Election results in 7 key swing counties show how Trump swept to victory,"Seven key swing counties, known as ""bellwether counties,"" with some exceptions, have consistently sided with the winning presidential candidate for decades.They are Door County, Wisconsin; Kent County, Michigan; Vigo County, Indiana; Clallam County in Washington; and Bucks, Erie and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.In some, Trump won or improved his performance from 2020. Other counties went for Harris, who is projected to lose the 2024 race.Here's how these battleground counties voted in Tuesday's election.Bucks County, Pennsylvania With 98% reporting as of Wednesday morning, Trump led in Bucks County, a primarily suburban county just north of Philadelphia, by a mere 512 votes. If Trump's lead of 49.58% to Harris' 49.45% holds, it would be the first time a Republican won the county since 1988. Biden beat Trump by four points in 2020.Trump is projected to win Pennsylvania, according to the Fox News Decision Desk.Erie County, PennsylvaniaIn Erie County, Trump is leading with 50.26% of the vote, compared to the 48.82% for Harris. Erie is situated in far northwestern Pennsylvania on Lake Erie, is primarily rural and significantly smaller in terms of population.That is a flip from 2020, when Biden won the county by 1 percentage point.Northampton County, PennsylvaniaTrump is also leading with 50.63% of the vote in Northampton County, where Harris received 48.40%. Northampton in eastern Pennsylvania is suburban and home to Lehigh University, a private research college.Biden won Northampton by less than a point in 2020.Berwood Yost, the director of the national survey group the Center for Opinion Research, said all three Pennsylvania counties mirror many of the key demographics, such as racial composition, educational attainment and population density, that make Pennsylvania so competitive.""Both campaigns see the path to the White House running through Pennsylvania,"" Yost said, adding the path to victory in Pennsylvania runs through Bucks, Erie and Northampton counties.Biden won Pennsylvania overall by a narrow 1.17 percent margin in 2020.Door County, WisconsinDoor County, Wisconsin, broke with its usual bellwether status on Tuesday night, as 50.56% of voters chose Harris, while 48.33% chose Trump, according to unofficial results Wednesday morning. That contrasted with the state as a whole. Trump carried battleground Wisconsin, Fox News projects, with 49.75% of the vote, compared to 48.8% who selected Harris.In 2020, Biden received 50% of the vote in Door County, while Trump received 48.6% there. Biden carried Wisconsin as a whole 49.6% to Trump's 48.9%, and the Democrat won the 2020 general election. Kent County, MichiganIn Kent County, Michigan, 51.53% of voters chose Harris, while 46.69% chose Trump. As of Wednesday morning, Trump is leading in Michigan with 50.09% of the vote to Harris' 48.09%, but the Fox News Decision Desk has not yet called the race. A traditionally conservative county that has moved into toss-up territory in recent years, Kent's chosen candidate has also won Michigan and the general election in the last three presidential contests.In the 2020 election, Biden won 52.1% of the vote in Kenty County, while Trump won 45.9%. That year, Biden carried Michigan with 50.6% of the vote, while Trump received 47.9%.According to WOOD-TV, that represented the first time more than half of the vote in Kenty County went to the Democratic candidate since Lyndon Johnson's re-election victory in 1964.""Traditionally, Kent County has been a Republican-leaning county, and its sort of dominant political culture has been in the spirit of Gerald Ford through Reagan-Bush conservatism, but that started to change right around the [Barack] Obama years,"" Whitt Kilburn, a political science professor at Grand Valley State University, told WOOD-TV, crediting a population boom and suburban development outside Grand Rapids for the change. A Democratic presidential candidate carried Kent County for the first time in more than 40 years in 2008 when the majority of voters chose Barack Obama. Despite his victory in the general election and winning Michigan's electoral votes, Obama lost Kent County by 8 percentage points to Mitt Romney in the 2012 election, according to WOOD-TV. Kilburn credited Trump for Kent County remaining purple territory. ""Trump, for the most part, has been pretty clear. He rejects Reagan-Bush conservatism, and you can extend that back to Ford as well… pillars of moral traditionalism, commitment to free trade, commitment to strong military alliances,"" Kilburn told WOOD-TV. ""MAGA conservatism is presented to voters as an alternative and an alternative that is radically different from those ideas of conservatism.""Vigo County, IndianaTrump won Vigo County, Indiana, with 58.08% of the vote, while Harris received 39.96%. The Republican presidential nominee also won statewide, receiving 59.08% of the vote, compared to 39.20% for Harris. Matthew Bergbower, a political science professor at Indiana State University, described a bellwether county as a ""microcosm of the nation"" in terms of political preferences.Though his county, Vigo County in Indiana, deviated by voting for Donald Trump in 2020, it has chosen the winning candidate in every election since 1952.Clallam County, WashingtonIn Clallam County, Washington, Harris received 54.29% of the vote, while Trump received 43.90%. The state of Washington also handed the Democratic presidential nominee 58.62% of the vote, while Trump received 39.10%. Before the 2024 contest, Clallam County stood out as the only county to have voted for the winning presidential candidate in every election since 1980. In 2020, Biden carried Clallam County with 50.4% of the vote, while Trump received 47.0%. Biden carried Washington state in 2020 with 58.4% of the vote, while Trump received 39.0%. Before Tuesday, the people of Clallam County considered themselves proud of their history as the ""last bellwether county"" in America.Pam Blakeman, chair of the Clallam County Republicans, previously told Fox News Digital that she thought the election ""will be close in our County, but I see it swinging towards Trump,"" pointing to good Republican turnout and a ground game that she said ""is the most active I have ever seen."" Yet, Ben Anderstone, a progressive Washington-based political consultant, had told Fox News Digital that ""a Trump win in Clallam County would be a bit of a surprise at this point.""In the 2024 election, the largest swing state of Pennsylvania handed Trump a victory with 50.78% of the vote, while Harris received 48.26%. And Trump also carried the state's three bellwether counties. ",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/election-results-7-key-swing-counties-show-how-trump-swept-victory
RFK Jr. says Trump White House will get fluoride out of drinking water,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Saturday that a potential Trump White House would advise communities to remove fluoride from drinking water, which would overturn decades of public health guidance. Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral in water that oral physicians say can help to prevent cavities at the right doses. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes community water fluoridation – the practice of adding fluoride to drinking water to increase its concentration to optimal levels – as a ""cornerstone strategy"" to prevent cavities and one of the ""10 great public health interventions of the 20th century."" However, health agencies warn long-term ingestion of fluoride in excess doses carries various health risks, and critics like Kennedy have campaigned to end community water fluoridation. The Environmental Protection Agency has established a maximum allowable concentration of fluoride in public drinking water to prevent adverse health effects. Kennedy declared the Trump White House would advise bringing that allowable concentration to zero on its first day in power. ""On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,"" Kennedy posted on X. ""Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease,"" he claimed, adding that former President Trump and first lady Melania Trump ""want to Make America Healthy Again."" His statement provoked a wave of criticism on social media and renewed expert concerns about Kennedy – who has often clashed with the scientific consensus on vaccine safety – being placed in a position of authority over public health. ""While President Trump has received a variety of policy ideas, he is focused on Tuesday’s election,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in response to media questions about Kennedy's statement. Currently, more than 200 million Americans, or about 75% of the population, drink fluoridated water.In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and they continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first city in the world to fluoridate its water supply. Experts have long said that washing teeth with fluoride is not comparable to the risks posed by ingesting fluoride, with the latter potentially triggering harmful neurotoxic effects. Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids.In August, a federal agency determined ""with moderate confidence"" that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.Then in September, a federal judge in California cited that study in an order requiring the EPA to further regulate fluoride because high levels pose ""an unreasonable risk"" to children.""Indeed, EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level of exposure,"" U.S. District Judge Edward Chen said. ""And ample evidence establishes that a mother’s exposure to fluoride during pregnancy is associated with IQ decrements in her offspring.""Even so, the judge said the court ""does not conclude with certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health.""Since 2015, federal health officials have recommended a fluoridation level of 0.7 milligrams per liter of water. For five decades before that, the recommended upper range was 1.2 ""after evidence increasingly established fluoride’s connection to adverse effects, including severe enamel fluorosis, risk of bone fracture, and potential skeletal fluorosis,"" the judge wrote. Skeletal fluorosis is a potentially crippling disorder which causes weaker bones, stiffness and pain.The World Health Organization has set a safe limit for fluoride in drinking water of 1.5. Separately, the EPA has a longstanding requirement that water systems cannot have more than 4 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water. Kennedy has said that Trump has promised to give him ""control"" over the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), should the former president win the White House on Tuesday.""I stand ready to help him rid the public health agencies of their pervasive conflicts and corruption and restore their tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science,"" Kennedy told the New York Times in a statement. The Trump campaign has said no decisions have been made about Cabinet-level positions or personnel, including the secretaries of HHS and USDA.""No formal decisions about Cabinet and personnel have been made, however, President Trump has said he will work alongside passionate voices like RFK Jr. to Make America Healthy Again by providing families with safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic plaguing our children,"" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. ""President Trump will also establish a special Presidential Commission of independent minds and will charge them with investigating what is causing the decades-long increase in chronic illnesses,"" she added.Trump told supporters at a rally on Saturday that he told Kennedy he ""can work on food, you can work on anything you want,"" except energy policy.""He wants health, he wants women’s health, he wants men’s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,"" Trump said.",3-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-says-trump-white-house-get-fluoride-out-drinking-water
Germany braces under collapsing government and looming Trump trade war,"With the re-election of former President Donald Trump to the White House and the collapse of the coalition government under German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Germany is bracing for an economically and politically dubious time. From the campaign trail, Trump pledged to increase import tariffs on friends and foes alike under the ""Trump Reciprocal Trade Act"" which would increase all U.S. tariffs to match the taxes enforced by each corresponding country.  ""If India, China, or any other country hits us with a 100 or 200 percent tariff on American-made goods, we will hit them with the same exact tariff,"" he outlined in his campaign agenda. ""If they charge US, we charge THEM—an eye for an eye, a tariff for a tariff, same exact amount.""However, it is unclear if the president-elect still plans to push these specific tariff increases, as he has also suggested there should be a 10% tariff on imports from all countries, as well as 60% duties on imports from China, according to a Reuters report. China was not the only country in Trump’s crosshairs, as the now president-elect also referred to the European Union (EU) as a ""mini China"" and warned the bloc would have to pay up.""They don't take our cars. They don't take our farm products. They sell millions and millions of cars in the United States,"" he told supporters at an October rally in Pennsylvania. ""No, no, no. They are going to have to pay a big price.""Some economic experts have warned that increasing tariffs – which are paid by companies importing the goods, not by government entities – could lead to rising costs worldwide, including in the U.S., as well as further inflation.A report earlier this month by the German Marshall Fund (GMF) pointed to findings by Germany’s Institute for Economic Research in Cologne that said the promised Trump tariffs are estimated to cost the country roughly $127 billion over the next four years. ""Trump’s victory does not bode well for a Germany that is dependent on U.S. security and thrives on open markets,"" the GMF said in its report on how the U.S. election will impact Germany. ""And uncertainty in Europe’s largest economy is not ideal when the EU needs to find its place in a world in which the U.S. president is not expected to support the traditional, rules-based international order.""However, it is not only Germany’s flagging economy that could spell uncertainty for Berlin’s international standing, as Scholz faces a vote of no confidence in January after he fired his Finance Minister Christian Lindner and his coalition government collapsed. A confidence vote is now set to be held in Germany on December 16 – which Scholz, given his minority status, is expected to lose. The most likely next step will be for German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to dissolve the parliament and call for elections which are not expected to be held on Feb. 23, 2025.  The EU now stares down a potential trade war with the Trump administration while one of its leading nations, both geopolitically and economically, will essentially sit as a lame duck while Berlin waits to see who will be next to lead the country. German opposition leader Friedrich Merz – who could find himself the next German chancellor – said he intends to cut a deal with Trump.In an interview with Stern magazine, Merz reportedly said, ""In Germany, we have never really articulated and enforced our interests well enough, and we have to change that.""The Americans are much more on the offensive. It shouldn’t end with only one side profiting, but rather with us making good arrangements for both sides,"" Merz said according to a Bloomberg report on the interview. ""Trump would call it a deal.""",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/world/germany-braces-under-collapsing-government-looming-trump-trade-war
Georgia GOP threatens lawsuit against deep-blue Fulton County over extended absentee voting,"Georgia Republicans are vowing to sue the Democratic stronghold of Fulton County after it announced extended elections office hours on Friday.The threat came after the state GOP learned that election officials in the county, which includes Atlanta, are planning to open four election offices this weekend ‘to accommodate voters seeking to hand-return their absentee ballots.'""This is a blatant violation of Georgia law . . . which states ‘all drop boxes shall be closed when the advance voting period ends,’"" the Georgia GOP said in a statement late on Friday.Fulton County is expected to be key to Democrats’ chances of winning Georgia again in 2024 – something that Republicans alluded to in their statement.""To make matters worse, the four election office locations are situated in areas of the county that will clearly favor Democrat candidates,"" the statement said.Fulton County was one of several to announce it would keep election offices open this weekend for voters turning in their existing absentee ballots in-person.Drop boxes are a way for voters to turn in their absentee ballots at elections offices without human contact, which is different from submitting them in person at the office itself.Drop boxes were available through Georgia’s early voting period from Oct. 15 through Nov. 1.But Republicans are arguing that the extended hours for turning in absentee ballots over the weekend run afoul of the state’s rules.Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement that counties are allowed to accept absentee ballots turned into their offices in-person if they choose.""Under state law, election officials can receive absentee ballots in person at govt facilities if the county chooses. Several counties have chosen to do this. We are working with the counties and the political parties to ensure this is done transparently and within Georgia law,"" Raffensperger said.Fox News Digital reached out to the Fulton County government and Kamala Harris presidential campaign for comment.NPR reporter Stephen Fowler wrote on X of the lawsuit threat, ""Multiple counties are doing it, and there's nothing illegal about it – these aren't drop boxes.""It comes after a Fulton County Superior Court judge rejected Republicans’ bid to force the county to hire more Republican poll workers for Election Day on Tuesday.State, federal and local Republican parties accused the Fulton County Department of Registration and Elections of not hiring enough GOP poll workers. They alleged that nine out of 45 qualified applicants were hired to help with early voting, while just six of 62 were hired for Election Day, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Judge Kevin Farmer said the case would be looked at further but declined to order emergency measures to force more Republican poll workers in by Tuesday.Fulton County has seen more than 439,000 active voters cast absentee or early in-person ballots during Georgia’s early voting period.A significant majority of those were women over men – 55.9% to 43.8%.Roughly 72% of the county’s White voters turned out during that period, as well as 49% of Black active voters there.Former President Trump lost Georgia to President Biden by less than 12,000 votes in 2020.",2-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-gop-threatens-lawsuit-against-deep-blue-fulton-county-over-extended-absentee-voting

"Trump's victory: Hollywood elite who vowed to leave US if he won are 'all talk, no walk,' expert says","In the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election, many celebrities proudly vocalized their opinions on President-elect Donald Trump.While some showed support, others, including Sharon Stone, Cher and Barbra Streisand, have expressed their disapproval and even threatened to leave the U.S. if he were to be elected.""I am certainly considering a house in Italy,"" Stone told the Daily Mail in July. ""I think that’s an intelligent construct at this time. This is one of the first times in my life that I’ve actually seen anyone running for office on a platform of hate and oppression.""In a 2023 interview with the Guardian, Cher said, ""I almost got an ulcer the last time. If he gets in, who knows? This time I will leave [the country].""Streisand told host Stephen Colbert that she wouldn't be able to ""live in this country if he becomes president,"" and admitted she'd probably move to England. Representatives for Cher, Stone and Streisand did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. This idea of celebrities fleeing the country after an election is nothing new, says Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR.""Every four years, you hear the same recycled rhetoric from celebrities. It's become a running joke at this point. It's ‘all talk, no walk,’"" Eldridge told Fox News Digital.In 2016, celebrities such as Whoopi Goldberg, Miley Cyrus, Amy Schumer, George Lopez and more vowed to pack up their lives and move if Trump was elected president.""Every four years, you hear the same recycled rhetoric from celebrities. It's become a running joke at this point. It's ‘all talk, no walk.'"" — Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PRAt the time of Trump's first run, Cyrus wrote on Instagram, ""My heart is broken into a 100000 pieces…I am moving if [Donald Trump] is my president! I don't say things I don't mean!"" She later posted an emotional video on X accepting Trump as president and asking him to ""treat people with love.""Schumer said on BBC’s ""Newsnight"" that same year, ""My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish because I will move to Spain or somewhere. It’s beyond my comprehension if Trump won. It’s just too crazy.""She later said her remarks were just ""said in jest"" as she expressed her disappointment with the 2016 election results on Instagram. While it's unclear if Streisand, Cher and Stone actually plan on leaving, Eldridge says their move should have ""little to no impact"" on their success.""The impact on the careers and the impact on their fan base are two distinct questions, but the answers are actually overlapping and interrelated,"" said Eldridge. ""Politically speaking, Hollywood has always been a bastion of liberal ideology, so the standard anti-Republican sentiments we hear every four years will have little to no impact on an actor's ability to gain future roles.""On the flip side, however, talent is only 50% of an actor's castability; the other half is based on fan appeal, Q score and box-office marketability,"" he added. ""The 'fan base variable' will likely become increasingly more relevant on the other side of this election.""""Trump not only won the Electoral College, he also won the popular vote, which was the first time a Republican has done so in 20 years,"" Eldridge continued. ""That said, while directors and producers will still readily cast an outspoken actor regardless of their saber-rattling rhetoric, fans might be less forgiving. Over half the country used their voice when casting their ballots, so that could have blowback on some of the more outspoken celebrities who chased clout and tried to put their thumb on the scale.""On Wednesday, celebrities flocked to social media to express their thoughts on Trump's victory over Vice President Harris.""Please unfollow me if you voted against female rights,"" Christina Applegate wrote on X. ""Against disability rights. Yeah that. Unfollow me because what you did is unreal. Don’t want followers like this. So yeah. Done. Also after today I will be shutting down this fan account that I have had for so many years because this is sick.""Mandy Moore shared her thoughts on her Instagram stories, writing, ""Shout out to all of us processing our grief, disbelief, anger, fear, uncertainty, devastation while simultaneously carrying on with life and putting on a brave face for our families…I see you.

This election season showed just how much we all care about where this country’s headed. Now that the votes are in, let’s remember—it doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a Republican, we’re all real Americans. It’s time to come together, talk with our neighbors and focus on what unites us. We all love this country, and we’re all in for building a better future. Love you all. HH.""While the aftermath of the election continues to affect people in different ways, Eldridge says that those with a platform should consider one thing.""The most logical thing any celebrity could say at this point, at least among those who vowed to move out of the country if Trump was elected, would be: 'He wasn't my vote, but as an American, he is my president. Whether you supported him or not, it's time for all of us to come together as a country and make this country what we all know it's capable of being, becoming or remaining great.'

'The worst thing I've ever heard': Holocaust survivor blasts Harris for comparing Trump to Hitler,"The Trump campaign released an ad Friday featuring a Holocaust survivor criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for comparing former President Trump to Adolf Hitler. ""I know more about Hitler than Kamala will ever know in a thousand lifetimes,"" 94-year-old Jerry Wartski, a survivor of Auschwitz, says in the roughly minute-and-a-half advertisement. ""For her to accuse President Trump of being like Hitler is the worst thing I've ever heard in my 75 years living in the United States.""Wartski said Trump was a ""mensch,"" a Yiddish term of endearment, arguing ""he has always stood with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.""Wartski also demanded an apology from Harris. ""I know President Trump, and he would never say this, and Kamala Harris knows this,"" Wartski says. ""She owes my parents and everybody else who was murdered by Hitler an apology.""Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment but did not immediately receive a response.The ad comes after Harris repeatedly compared Trump to Hitler this week, including during a press conference from the steps of her formal residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., during a town hall Wednesday that Harris conducted with CNN and on social media. Harris' remarks followed media reports this week that detailed alleged claims by ex-Trump administration officials, including Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, that the former president on ""multiple occasions"" praised Hitler and the loyalty his Nazi generals showed him.""Donald Trump is out for unchecked power. He wants a military like Adolf Hitler had, who will be loyal to him, not our Constitution,"" Harris posted to X this week. ""He is unhinged, unstable, and given a second term, there would be no one to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses.""""If the President of the United States, the commander in chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, 'Why can't you be more like Hitler's generals?' Anderson, come on. This is a serious, serious issue,"" Harris said during her town hall event Wednesday. ""And we know who he is. He admires dictators, sending love letters back and forth with Kim Jong Un.""",25-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/the-worst-thing-ive-ever-heard-holocaust-survivor-blasts-harris-comparing-trump-hitler
"Leave the oil to me: Trump vows to unleash US energy, undo key Biden rules in 2nd term","President-elect Donald Trump spent much of his time on the 2024 campaign trail pledging to restore U.S. energy dominance through bolstering oil and gas production, expanding fracking and lifting a pause on liquefied natural gas exports, a sharp contrast with his predecessor and prompting new questions over how he will move to enact some of these sweeping changes. Trump vowed at a Pennsylvania rally last month that he would lift the Biden administration's ""war on energy"" and ""disastrous"" energy policies that he argued permeated the current administration.""They annihilated your steel mills, decimated your coal jobs, assaulted your oil and gas jobs and sold off your manufacturing jobs to China and other foreign nations all over the world,"" Trump said of the Biden administration.It's not the first time Trump has used energy and climate issues to cut a sharp contrast with his predecessor. The Republican president-elect has vowed to use his second White House term to re-exit the Paris climate accord, undo strict emissions standards for vehicles and power plants, and bolster production of U.S. oil and gas, including through fracking, which is the controversial technology by which pressurized fluids are used to extract natural gas from shale rock.In the days after his victory, industry groups representing the nation’s biggest oil and gas producers told Fox News Digital they have little doubt Trump will make good on these promises in a second term.""Energy was on the ballot"" in the 2024 elections, American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement.In electing Trump, Sommers said voters ""sent a clear signal that they want choices, not mandates, and an all-of-the-above approach that harnesses our nation’s resources and builds on the successes of his first term.""But some areas will be more difficult for Trump to act on unilaterally.Trump has for months vowed to ""undo"" the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats' marquee climate and clean energy spending legislation that allocates $369 billion in subsidies aimed at reshoring investments for electric vehicle manufacturing and battery production as well as new utility-scale wind and solar projects.Trump has described the law as the ""greatest scam in history,"" but on his own it's unclear what actions he could take to undo the legislation.Though Trump now enjoys majority Republican support in both the House and Senate, it's unlikely he would move to completely overturn the Inflation Reduction Act, in part because a large chunk of the funds designated under the law to help subsidize the build-out of clean energy projects and manufacturing plants has already been awarded.Much of the funding, in fact, has gone to Republican-led states.Other hurdles also exist. Since the IRA is a law, Trump could not move on his own to undo the legislation. But he could take certain steps to restrict eligibility for certain tax credits or incentives.As president, Trump could tighten restrictions for automakers eligible for the electric vehicle tax credit, ramping up manufacturing costs and in turn making electric vehicles more expensive for consumers.Trump is also likely to introduce new tariffs on certain Chinese-made EVs and other products in a bid to incentivize Beijing to build more of its EVs in the U.S.On that front, Trump said this year he is considering tariffs of ""60% or higher"" on Chinese-made EVs to prevent their vehicles from saturating the U.S. market.But this could backfire, some experts warn. The Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy estimated that even a 10% tariff on Chinese-made EVs could raise taxes for U.S. consumers by more than $300 billion per year.It could also threaten retaliatory measures from Beijing and other trading partners, including retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, the group said.Still, Republicans and industry groups are unlikely to let up on the pressure to act. The American Petroleum Institute published a five point ""policy road map"" this week, seeking to influence the incoming administration's actions in the auto manufacturing sector. Among its asks: Rolling back the Biden administration’s stringent fuel economy standards for vehicles, which target an 8% reduction in tailpipe pollution for both 2024 and 2025 model years and then increase to 10% in 2026.It also asked Trump to issue a five-year plan to expand offshore oil and gas drilling leases.""Our country has a generational opportunity to fully leverage U.S. energy leadership to improve the lives of all Americans and bring stability to a volatile world,"" Sommers said in a letter that API sent to Trump alongside its plan.""It has never been more vital that America control its energy future.""But others doubt Trump will renege on an industry that has already seen billions of dollars of investments from automakers. ""Presidents come and go, but the auto industry motors on,"" Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights and corporate communications at Cox Automotive, told reporters this week.",14-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/leave-oil-me-trump-vows-unleash-u-s-energy-undo-key-biden-rules-second-term
Tim Scott launches bid to chair NRSC as GOP seeks to capitalize on new minority gains,"Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., is running to lead the Senate Republican campaign arm in the next election cycle, sharing the announcement exclusively with Fox News Digital.On Friday, Scott launched his bid to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) for the 2026 midterm cycle, after speculation last month that he planned to do so.""Let’s do this! I’m running for NRSC Chair because two years of a Republican agenda is good, but four years of success under Donald J. Trump is even better,"" he told Fox News Digital in a statement.""That means the entire four years of his presidency will create low inflation, secure borders and safe streets, leading to a generation of American prosperity! With Donald J. Trump in the White House and Republicans leading the U.S. Senate, we will protect our majority in 2026 and create opportunities for all Americans."" The South Carolina senator ran for president in the 2024 Republican primary before dropping out and endorsing Trump. He was also considered a contender to be Trump's running mate before Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, was chosen. Scott additionally rolled out three high-profile endorsements to go with his campaign announcement.Current NRSC Chairman Steve Daines, R-Mont., who just successfully led the campaign arm in helping Republicans take back the majority, has thrown his support behind Scott. ""We took back the U.S. Senate in 2024, and there is no one I trust more to protect the majority in 2026 than Tim Scott,"" Daines said in a statement. The South Carolina Republican was also endorsed by Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso, R-Wyo.""Tim’s inspiring message, record of fundraising and vision for the party makes him the perfect partner for President Trump,"" Barrasso said. ""Together, they will protect and grow the Republican majority. There’s nobody better than Tim Scott.""""Protecting the majority and growing the party starts with a vision and the resources to compete anywhere. That is why I’m confident in Tim leading the NRSC into 2026,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in his own statement backing Scott. The election will be held on Nov. 13 and decided via a secret ballot along with other Senate GOP leadership races. Scott's bid for the top NRSC role comes on the heels of the Republican Party and Trump seeing significant gains across the country with minorities in the 2024 elections. As one of only four Black senators in the 118th Congress and the only Black Republican senator, Scott has made a variety of efforts to reach minority voters on behalf of the GOP. In the last three months, he held a Black financial literacy event in North Carolina, an event on Black Opportunity Zones in Wisconsin, a Black pastor event in Michigan and school choice events in Wisconsin, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Chicago. He also joined fellow Black Republican representatives Burgess Owens, R-Utah; Byron Donalds, R-Fla.; John James, R-Mich.; and Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, earlier in the year to launch a weekly video series dedicated to the voices of Black members of the GOP. The series was called ""America's Starting Five."" ",8-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-scott-launches-nrsc-chair-bid-gop-seeks-capitalize-new-minority-gains
Harris picks up endorsements from New Hampshire Republicans 6 days before election,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday picked up endorsements from three longtime Republican leaders in New Hampshire who supported former President Trump's rival Nikki Haley in the Republican primary.Former Sen. Gordon Humphrey, former Rep. and former New Hampshire Supreme Court Justice Chuck Douglas and former New Hampshire Attorney General Thomas Rath condemned Trump as a divisive and unstable candidate in statements declaring their support for Harris. Her campaign said the endorsements reflect growing enthusiasm for the vice president among registered Republicans both in the Granite State and the rest of the nation.""I voted Republican for fifty years, but I’m voting against Donald Trump and I plead with all Republicans to do the same,"" Humphrey said in a statement.  ""As a father, a grandfather, a veteran, and a former United States Senator, I cannot vote for Trump. He’s dangerous to our democracy."" Douglas said that Trump ""believes in himself over service"" and views the election ""as the chance to jail his political opponents."" Harris would be a ""steady hand at the ship of state"" in contrast to Trump's ""fragile mental state and anger,"" according to the former lawmaker. Rath likewise condemned Trump's ""campaign of division, anger, thinly veiled prejudice, and rejection of our core values as a nation."" The Harris-Walz campaign welcomed their support and noted that hundreds of current and former Republicans across the country have backed Harris, including former GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger. In New Hampshire specifically, the campaign said there has been a 47% increase in registered Republican volunteers compared to 2022 and a 76% increase in the number of GOP voters who have told canvassers they plan to vote for Democrats next week.  ""While Vice President Harris has made clear there is a home in her campaign for all Americans — including Republicans and independents — Donald Trump continues to double down on his extreme agenda,"" the campaign said in a news release.Reached for comment, the Trump campaign noted that Haley is supporting his candidacy, along with former Democrats Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. ""President Trump is building a historic and diverse movement to make America great again,"" Trump national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. ""He's been endorsed by many respected leaders from Nikki Haley to RFK Jr., and Tulsi Gabbard. We welcome anyone who wants to secure our border, restore law and order, and end inflation to join our team.""New Hampshire has been an important swing state in prior presidential elections, although Harris has held a consistent lead over Trump in public opinion polls this year.

NBA coach Doc Rivers says 'we have to support Trump' after bashing the him throughout election cycle,"Milwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers gave his thoughts on Donald Trump's election win, saying Americans must stand behind the next president. ""Donald Trump is our president, and we're going to have to support him. We want him to do the best job for the country at the end of the day,"" Rivers told reporters after practice Wednesday. ""Do I like some of the things that he does? No. But now he's getting a second chance to be a better president than he was the first time, and I hope he is. I'm cheering for him. I really am.""Rivers has been a vocal critic of Trump and a staunch supporter of Kamala Harris after she became the Democratic nominee in July. Rivers most recently called Trump's campaign rally at Madison Square Garden Oct. 28 ""atrocious."" Rivers even appeared in multiple political ads in support of Harris, providing his voice in one ad that accused Trump of ""empty promises."" In another, he appeared in person next to Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff.""I've known Kamala. This is the most involved I've ever been in an election, and a lot of it was personal because I've known Kamala for over 15 years. I thought she would have been a terrific president,"" Rivers said Wednesday. ""The problem is 65 million-plus disagreed with me.""Trump has received more than 72 million votes in the election. Rivers is one of many high-profile NBA figures who have been outwardly critical of Trump, joining fellow coaches Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors and Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban. That group has publicly acknowledged and accepted Trump's victory and encouraged other Americans to do the same since Tuesday's results despite previous partisan criticisms of the president. Rivers' made his comments about Trump's Madison Square Garden rally when the Bucks were playing the Brooklyn Nets across the East River Oct. 28. ""If you saw Madison Square Garden, I mean come on. … Like, right?"" Rivers said, via Sports Illustrated ""So, to me, it’s so important to vote. I’m gonna keep it as close to that as possible. But gosh. When I tell people, if the guy was so great, why did 80 million people vote against him the last time he ran.""I don’t know. I don’t get it.

We'll do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, what you need,"" President Biden said as cameras and reporters were briefly allowed in the Oval Office for the meeting.But it was Biden's apparent joyful demeanor which delighted conservatives on social media, who remarked that the president had ""never looked happier.""""Biden's never looked happier,"" Link Lauren, former senior adviser to Robert F.

Trump ally floated as possible AG has harsh warning for Letitia James: 'We will put your fat a-- in prison',"Mike Davis, a staunch ally of President-elect Donald Trump, had some harsh words for New York Attorney General Letitia James during an appearance on ""The Benny Show"" podcast on Thursday. ""Let me just say this to Big Tish James, the New York Attorney General … I dare you to continue your lawfare against President Trump in his second term,"" the founder of the Article III Project said. ""Because listen here sweetheart, we’re not messing around this time. And we will put your fat a-- in prison for conspiracy against rights and I promise you that."" Davis warned James to ""think long and hard before you want to violate President Trump’s constitutional rights or any other American’s constitutional rights."" ""It’s not going to happen again,"" Davis said. James ordered Trump to pay a $454 million bond payment earlier this year as part of a civil fraud case brought against the former commander-in-chief. The New York AG accused Trump of overinflating the value of his assets to get better loans. Trump later appealed the ruling. His attorneys called New York Judge Arthur Engoron’s ruling ""draconian, unlawful, and unconstitutional.""After Trump's electoral victory on Tuesday, James and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowed to fight back against any potential ""revenge or retribution"" that may be coming their way now that President-elect Trump will be returning to the White House.In his interview with Johnson, Davis also took shots at Fulton County Attorney General Fani Willis, who brought charges against Trump for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. ""[Fani Willis] is going to get disqualified from this case. This case will go to another district attorney in Georgia and no one in their right mind would bring this case again because it is not a crime to object to a presidential election,"" Davis said. Willis, a Democrat, won her bid for re-election on Tuesday, defeating Republican challenger Courtney Kramer. Willis made headlines just a month into her tenure, announcing in February 2021 that she was investigating whether Trump and others broke any laws while trying to overturn his narrow loss in the state to Biden. The case is largely on hold while Trump and other defendants appeal a judge’s ruling allowing Willis to continue prosecuting the case. Fox News Digital has reached out to the offices of James and Willis seeking a response to Davis’ comments. A former Supreme Court clerk and Senate aide, Davis has been suggested as a possible candidate for White House Counsel in the forthcoming Trump administration. Davis has dismissed these rumors, writing on X: ""No, thank you. I want to serve as Viceroy.""

Democrats' furor over 'unqualified' Trump nominees puts Biden's staffing decisions back in the spotlight,"Conservatives are pushing back after Democrats have criticized President-elect Trump’s Cabinet appointments for not being ""qualified"" by pointing to several examples of members of the Biden-Harris administration and campaign having questionable qualifications for their roles.In recent days, Democrats in Congress and in the media have blasted Trump Cabinet nominees over their qualifications, including combat veteran Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense; South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as secretary of homeland security; Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as attorney general; and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), among others. ""Three recent Trump nominees - Gaetz, Hegseth, and Gabbard - are far less qualified than Senate confirmation rejects like Bork, Tower, and Mier,"" Harvard Professor Lawrence Summers, who served in the Clinton and Obama administrations, posted on X. ""I hope that the Senate will do its duty.""""Pete Hegseth is not remotely qualified to be Secretary of Defense,"" Dem. Rep. Jason Crow posted on X.""[Pete Hegseth] is not qualified to be the Secretary of Defense. I lead the Senate military personnel panel. All three of my brothers served in uniform,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said, omitting his decades-long military career. ""I respect every one of our servicemembers. Donald Trump’s pick will make us less safe and must be rejected.""Democrats have also slammed Trump for nominating Kennedy as his HHS secretary despite a resurfaced Politico report revealing that Kennedy was being considered by Obama for Environmental Protection Agency during his 2008 presidential transition.Since taking office in 2021, Biden has faced criticism from Republicans over several members of his administration who were believed to be lacking key attributes needed to perform the duties they were assigned in addition to scandals. ""The Democrats are melting down over Trump‘s cabinet picks so far, but they had no problem with ‘Mayor Pete’ being appointed Secretary of Transportation with no prior qualifications,"" Link Lauren, an influencer and political commentator, who served as senior adviser to the Kennedy campaign, told Fox News Digital. ""Trump won the popular vote, the electoral college, the House and the Senate. That is a mandate from the American people that they want systemic change. I understand some of Trump‘s appointees have garnered mixed reactions — even from Republicans. But let’s give Trump’s appointees a chance, then verify in time that they are doing a great job.""Buttigieg was appointed Biden’s transportation secretary after serving as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, for eight years, with some questioning at the time whether he had enough related experience for the job. Since taking office, Republicans have amplified those concerns after a series of perceived missteps from Buttigieg, including the fallout from the supply chain crises and the devastating train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.""Take Secretary Buttigieg — his only qualifications for the job was a failed presidential campaign and time spent as a university-town mayor,"" Bradley Devlin, Politics Editor at The Daily Signal, told Fox News Digital. ""From East Palestine to electric chargers, it hasn’t gone well for ‘Mayor Pete,’ but Buttigieg has retained his job because he’s remained loyal to the Biden administration’s attempted radical energy and transportation policies.""Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who worked as a lawyer before serving as counsel to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., then an adviser to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, rose through the ranks into high-profile positions in the Obama administration but has been maligned as unqualified by Republicans over a series of national security blunders that occurred during his tenure, including the botched Afghanistan withdrawal and falsely claiming that the ""Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades"" days before Hamas killed at least 1,200 Israelis in a vicious attack.Republicans criticized Sullivan's role as Biden's national security adviser, the youngest in history, due to his previous pushing of the ""Russia collusion hoax"" as part of the Clinton campaign and his role in her State Department office amid the Benghazi cover-up.Several other Biden officials have faced heated criticism over their qualifications in recent years, including former senior Department of Energy official Sam Brinton, who identifies as nonbinary and was arrested multiple times for baggage theft at airports.Eric Lipka, who served as a deputy press secretary on the Biden-Harris campaign, sparked controversy earlier this year over his drag queen alter ego ""Erotica the Drag Queen.""Tyler Cherry, who worked in both the Biden White House and the Department of Interior, was hired and promoted despite several social media posts comparing police to ""slave patrols,"" promoting conspiracies about Russia colluding with Trump and supporting the anti-Israel movement.Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., when asked on Thursday about the controversy surrounding Trump’s appointment of Gaetz, held up a photo of assistant HHS Secretary Rachel Levine and Brinton asked, ""Did you ask Democratic senators about this?""Levine, the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the Senate, has faced criticism from Republicans on various issues such as sex change surgeries for minors and was labeled by a New York Post op-ed as ""America’s No.1 gender extremist.""Dozens of scientists from universities and environmental groups pushed for the removal of the head of Biden’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, claiming she lacked the educational background required to run the agency despite securing Senate confirmation.""Liberals and progressives bemoaning these nominees’ alleged lack of qualifications are simply looking to protect the system they created — a government of, by and for the ‘experts’ — and that benefits them politically,"" Devlin told Fox News Digital.""This can be seen well beyond Biden’s cabinet picks, too. For example, the first 10 Biden-appointed appellate judges averaged merely 14 authored opinions each from the bench. Trump’s first 12 appellate judges, meanwhile, had averaged 34 over a similar time period — twice as many as Biden’s nominees.""In 2023, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blasted the qualifications of Biden’s judicial appointments saying in a press release, ""The American people deserve the best and brightest. The Democrats are producing… something else.""""Xavier Becerra, HHS - not a doctor, he’s a lawyer, ex-attorney general of California Jared Bernstein, Chair of Council of Economic Advisors - not an economist, Bachelor’s degree in music, masters in sociology,"" FOX Business Evening Edit anchor Liz McDonald posted on X.""Jennifer Granholm, Energy Secy - no energy background, Michigan Governor Gina Raimondo, Commerce Secretary - No trade background, Gov of Rhode Island Deb Haaland, Interior Secy - New Mexico Congressman,"" she continued.Conservative radio host and Fox News host Mark Levin pointed to Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz as evidence that Democrats have been hypocritical on the issue of cabinet qualifications. ""The Democrat Party nominated and supported Tim Walz for vice president,"" Levin posted on X.""I don't want to hear from that party or its media that any of the Trump nominees are unqualified for their posts. They have demonstrated that they have no standards at all when it comes to selecting even a vice-presidential candidate. Every Trump nominee has a solid record.

Democrat senator reacts to Gaetz nomination: 'Red alert moment',"Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., warned Tuesday that President-elect Trump's selection of former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., to be U.S. attorney general signaled Trump's intention to follow through on promises to persecute his opponents.Murphy called the firebrand Floridian ""dangerously unqualified"" to lead the Justice Department, noting that Gaetz urged the need to abolish the FBI and other law enforcement agencies that do not get in line with conservative priorities.""Gaetz has been Trump's chief defender when it comes to Trump's assault on democracy. His attempt to overthrow the government on January 6th. And he has openly called for the abolition of law enforcement agencies if they don't get in line with conservative political priorities,"" Murphy said.""This is going to be a red alert moment for American democracy. Matt Gaetz is being nominated for one reason and one reason only: Because he will implement Donald Trump's transition of the Department of Justice from an agency that stands up for all of us to an agency that is simply an arm of the White House designed to persecute and prosecute Trump's political enemies."" Trump sent shock waves through the political world on Wednesday, when he tapped Gaetz, who has never worked in law enforcement, to be the nation's top law enforcement officer. In a statement, Trump lauded Gaetz as ""a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney"" who ""will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans’ badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.""Murphy noted that several Republican senators have already signaled their opposition to the controversial now ex-congressman, who was previously under a yearlong investigation stemming from accusations he had a sexual relationship with a minor. The Department of Justice ultimately did not press charges.""You could literally hear the jaws dropping to the floor of Republican senators who are now going to be in a position to stand up to Donald Trump in a way that they have been unwilling to,"" said Murphy.However, he added the announcement was ""not surprising"" since ""Trump told us during the campaign that he was going to use the White House to go after people who politically opposed him."" ""It seems that this pick for the head of the Department of Justice is very much in line with the promises he made during the campaign,"" said Murphy.",14-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-senator-reacts-gaetz-nomination-red-alert-moment
"'Extraordinary circumstances': NY judge in Trump case pauses all court deadlines, sentencing","The Manhattan judge overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's trial agreed to grant a stay on all deadlines associated with the felony conviction proceedings against Trump in the final months before he takes office, a closely-watched decision that allows Trump to avoid a maximum sentence of up to four years in prison.The judge overseeing the case, Judge Juan Merchan, granted the request, which issues a stay on all deadlines, including the Nov. 26 sentencing date, to consider the effect of his election as president.Prosecutors had asked for the pause in proceedings, which they said would allow them to better evaluate the impact of Trump’s new status as president-elect.""The People agree that these are unprecedented circumstances,"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said in a letter to Judge Merchan.Trump's attorneys, who had filed a motion to vacate the charges completely, also backed the stay. Trump was convicted in May by a Manhattan jury on 34 counts of falsifying business records, stemming from a case about payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.Merchan agreed earlier this year to a four-month delay for the court proceedings, pushing next steps until after the 2024 presidential election. He had set Nov. 12 as a self-imposed deadline to decide how best to proceed.The decision comes after the Supreme Court said in a July 1 ruling that presidents should enjoy presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for most actions taken as president.Justices writing for a 4-3 majority said that presidents are entitled to absolute immunity from any actions taken within the scope of ""core constitutional powers"" as commander-in-chief. A presumption of immunity also applies to other actions taken while holding office, they said.It is not clear whether a president is to be afforded the same level of constitutional protections for state convictions, however, and the matter has never been tested in court.Trump officials praised the pause in court proceedings Tuesday. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital that the pause makes ""abundantly clear that Americans want an immediate end to the weaponization of our justice system, including this case … so we can unify our country and work together for the betterment of our nation.""The Nov. 12 deadline is separate from the sentencing hearing for the 34 convictions, which had previously been set for Nov. 26. Rather, this was a self-imposed deadline set by Merchan that allows him to consider Trump’s claims of presidential immunity and whether the Supreme Court’s July ruling on the scope of immunity should apply to the state level.Even if Trump’s convictions were upheld, the president-elect has myriad ways to appeal the case or get the charges against him dismissed before the Nov. 26 sentencing hearing — making it all but certain he will face no time behind bars.The first would be moving the case from state to federal court — which Trump’s lawyers had twice tried and failed to do in the months ahead of the election. However, their request to elevate the case to federal court now carries more weight, given Trump’s status as president-elect. If that fails, Trump’s attorneys would likely appeal the convictions ahead of his sentencing hearing, using the Supreme Court immunity ruling as grounds to have the charges dismissed. They are also likely to use the immunity claim to throw out portions of evidence used by prosecutors in the New York case, including testimony from former White House communications director Hope Hicks.Even if all this fails, legal analysts and former prosecutors have roundly dismissed the idea that Trump would face prison time for the convictions.""Understand, Trump is not going to prison even if Merchan metes out an incarceration sentence. Though the charges are felonies, they are not sufficiently serious under New York law to merit immediate detention; Trump will get bail pending appeal,"" Andrew McCarthy, a former U.S. prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, wrote in an op-ed last week for Fox News Digital.Had Merchan moved to keep the convictions intact, he could have sought additional guidance from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, including on whether Trump should be submitted to state convictions as a sitting president — a question that has never been tested.Trump's legal team would almost certainly have appealed any conviction as far as the Supreme Court, if necessary.Trump is shielded from federal convictions under longstanding Justice Department policy preventing U.S. attorneys from prosecuting a sitting president.However, this precedent has never been applied to state convictions, giving Judge Merchan a somewhat wider berth in deciding how to proceed. His decision comes days after special counsel Jack Smith filed a motion to vacate all deadlines in the 2020 election interference case against President-elect Trump in Washington, D.C. Smith had been tapped by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 to investigate both the alleged effort by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, as well as Trump's keeping of allegedly classified documents at his residence in Florida after leaving the White House in 2020.While those charges have not been officially dropped, the special counsel appears to be moving in that direction, and Smith said his team plans to give an updated report on the official status of the case against Trump on Dec. 2. Former Attorney General Bill Barr told Fox News Digital that state and local prosecutors and judges need to move on from the ""spectacle"" of prosecuting the president-elect.

SNL mocks its own anti-Trump stance with 'support' of his victory: 'Been with you all along',"Saturday Night Live sent up its clear opposition to Donald Trump in the first cold open after his election victory this week, with the show's actors pretending they supported him all along.The show started out deadly serious, with cast member Ego Nwodim saying that Trump's victory over Kamala Harris was ""shocking and even horrifying"" to many people. As the cast solemnly noted there were no protections now for those who are ""brave enough to speak out against him,"" the punchline came as cast member Kenan Thompson said, ""We at SNL would like to say to Donald Trump, we have been with you all along.""""We have never wavered in our support of you, even when others doubted you,"" cast member Bowen Yang said. The skit went on to joke that the entire liberal cast voted for Trump and wanted their children to emulate him, and they would rat out anyone at SNL who voted for Harris.James Austin Johnson, who portrays Trump, appeared donning a muscular bodysuit for SNL's new impression of ""hot, jacked Trump,"" rolling his eyes. Dana Carvey also made a cameo to parody billionaire Elon Musk, who the cast also said they support.""Hail Trump,"" Thompson said at one point.Comedian Bill Burr hosted the episode on Saturday and addressed the election in his monologue, telling the ""ladies"" to quit with the pantsuits. ""Ladies, you're 0-2 against this guy,"" Burr said. ""Enough with the pantsuits. It’s not working. Stop trying to have respect for yourselves. You don’t win the office like on policy, you know? You've got to whore it up a little. I’m not saying go full Hooters. Find the happy medium between Applebee’s and your dad didn’t stick around."" Burr went on to poke fun at undecided voters in the race and also suggest Trump survived his first assassination attempt because of his ""herky jerky movements"" on the stage. ""The guy is a lunatic,"" Burr said of Trump. ""I mean, he literally got shot and immediately jumped back up and started yelling in the direction the bullets were coming from, unarmed. That’s not a sane human being. I would have been on the ground in the fetal position like, 'I don’t want the job! Tell her she won! Tell her she won!'""Burr memorably appeared on ""Conan"" after Trump's inauguration in 2017 and surprised the liberal audience by blasting Hillary Clinton for blowing the election.SNL has done little to hide its derision for Trump over the years, who hosted the show twice, including during his first presidential run in 2015. Trump quickly fell out of favor at SNL, which openly celebrated his defeat at Joe Biden's hands in 2020.It also did its best to boost Harris, giving her a guest spot on the final show before the election last week. She appeared as the ""mirror image"" on Saturday night of herself, portrayed by Maya Rudolph, at the end of the cold open in front of a cheering audience.Trump easily defeated Harris on Tuesday, completing a remarkable political comeback and becoming only the second president ever to win non-consecutive terms.This time, the show attempted some laughs in its cold open after grappling with a disappointing election result.SNL mourned Clinton's loss to Trump in 2016, with actress Kate McKinnon as Clinton playing ""Hallelujah"" on the piano and tearfully telling the audience she wasn't ""giving up, and neither should you.""The show later parodied liberals who had confidently predicted a Republican would never get the White House again and were sure Clinton would win.",10-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/snl-mocks-its-own-anti-trump-stance-support-his-victory-been-you-all-along
"Tennessee governor backs Trump plan to nix Department of Education, sees bellwether on new school choice bill","Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee told Fox News Digital that he believes President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory signals success for a second school choice bill introduced to the state legislature this week after his first proposal failed this year. Lee said he agreed with Trump's promises to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, echoing the president-elect's concern over the federal bureaucracy becoming entrenched with gender and race ideology rather than learning.""I think it is a great idea to dismantle the Department of Education federally. And I'm a strong believer that policy at the state level should be handled by states, that states know best,"" Lee told Fox News Digital. ""In this case, states certainly know best. We know best in Tennessee what our children need and how best to educate our kids. The parents of this state should be given a greater influence on how their kids are educated, and that will happen if the federal Department of Education is dismantled and those funds are delivered to states to be used in a more efficient and more effective way.""Lee said the political environment on the ground in the state is not what it was months ago when the first school choice proposal failed in the state legislature. Since then, the election saw a wave of pro-school choice candidates win at the state-level, and Trump succeeded in his bid for the White House.""President Trump has long believed that school choice is important for the people of this country and that education freedom is something that all Americans could have. He's talked about it. He campaigned on it,"" Lee said. ""One thing is very evident about what happened last week. And President Trump is very clear about what his policies are, and Americans were very clear about their acceptance of those policies last week. They, with a strong mandate, said we like what we hear. We want him to execute on those things and that President Trump has a significant understanding and a clear understanding and is the leader, frankly, on the issue of school choice. All of those things benefit us as we move into this next session.""Lee's new school choice bill, titled the Education Freedom Act of 2025, was jointly introduced to the state House and Senate on Wednesday.Drawing from funding already approved by the state legislature, the bill would allow the state Department of Education to award up to 20,000 scholarships – valued at about $7,000 each – for the next school year to be spent on tuition, tutoring, technology and examination expenses. The first 10,000 scholarships would be set aside for low-income students whose parents might not otherwise afford to send their children to institutions other than the public schools in their districts. Democrats have painted school choice as disenfranchising low-income students, but Lee said he feels the opposite.""Every kid is unique. Every kid has different learning styles. Every kid has a different life situation. And every family ought to have the opportunity to choose the best path for their kid,"" the governor said. ""In particular, I don't think that only the wealthy families that can afford a private option, that those families should be the only ones and those children should be the only ones that have that option for choice.""""Oftentimes, opponents will say that school choice initiatives hurt public schools. I think that's just the opposite,"" Lee said. ""This legislation that we're actually bringing forth is an education policy initiative. It's not just an Education Freedom Scholarship bill. It includes historic funding for public schools, bonuses for teachers, for public school teachers. We will include alongside with this legislation a teacher pay raise plan that will put us in the top 15 states for teacher pay raise in the country.""Lee noted that about 30 states already have school choice, 12 of which have universal school choice, and several of those states have passed their initiatives in recent years. ""Americans are in growing numbers, and now the majority of Americans, as evidenced by the past elections, have come to believe that school choice is the way of the future,"" Lee said. ""It is the answer to challenging the status quo. It is the way that we take America's rankings and educational outcomes that used to be the top in the world from way down the list as it relates to other countries back up into the outcomes that we hope for this country.""""This is a way to challenge and change and bring innovation into an education system that's grown stale and bloated and bureaucratic,"" Lee said. ""And we see it happening all across America. We believe it's going to happen in Tennessee. It is an incredibly important moment in our country for parental rights and for the future of children and their education."" Lee said his schooling growing up in Tennessee happened before the U.S. Department of Education was established in 1979. ""We knew how to do it then. We know how to do it now,"" Lee said, explaining that Tennessee created a funding formula that ""uniquely recognizes the needs of children with disabilities, with dyslexia and with English as a second language. ""We know how to fund education for Tennessee children. We know much better than they do in a bureaucratic institution like the federal Department of Education. I think President Trump is exactly right. I think it's a great idea.""""As a governor, I would welcome the partnership with President Trump in allowing states to choose and determine how best to spend education dollars for their kids,"" he added.If Trump goes through with eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, experts expect the process could take several years. With Cabinet nominations underway, Fox News Digital asked Lee who he would like to see as Trump's education secretary and if the governor would consider throwing his own name in the running.""What I will say is and what I hope is that whoever takes this job is looking to work themselves out of a job,"" Lee said. ""It will take the right kind of leader who really understands, and I think, who really understands how states can function and how problematic for states federal bureaucracies are. Governors understand that. There are a lot of folks who would be well-qualified for this, but the next person needs to be hoping to work themselves out of a job.""  On the heels of the devastation brought by Hurricane Helene, the governor said the new school choice bill would also commit state dollars from its sports gambling revenue to the construction and maintenance of public school facilities. The bill also offers $2,000 one-time bonuses to every teacher in the state and promises supplemental funding for school districts affected by enrollment drops.""We can have the best public schools in America,"" Lee said. ""We can commit the right amount of finances and the right amount of focus. We can strengthen and support our public schools in unprecedented ways and provide freedom and opportunity for parents and choice. At the same time, those are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they shouldn't be. We should improve every educational opportunity for every kid in our state and will do so through this legislation.""",15-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tennessee-governor-backs-trump-plan-nix-department-education-sees-bellwether-new-school-choice-bill
"Trump's 'they/them' ads combined culture war, economic worries to make effective pitch: expert","In the final days of President-elect Donald Trump's 2024 campaign, he honed in on a culture war issue that may have locked in more swing votes and with it the election, a conservative activist instrumental in the ad campaign argues.""Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you,"" the narrator of Trump's advertisement said.The ad, which focused on men in women's sports and Vice President Kamala Harris' track record of ushering in sex change procedures for incarcerated people in California, was in part due to the influence of American Principles Project's president, Terry Schilling, who began pushing out these ads in 2019.Schilling said back then, the issue was ""too premature"" to make waves in the conservative movement. But over the course of the Biden-Harris administration, as the gender ideology wars began to make it into the mainstream spotlight, Schilling believed it would be a winning issue for conservatives.The American Principles Project spent tens of millions on ads highlighting the transgender issue in states across the country, and Schilling went to Mar-a-Lago a few months ago to personally encourage Trump to lean in on the opportunity.""The cue of giving sex change procedures to inmates is so radical, it's so extreme, and it's one of those issues that touches on not just the culture war, but the economy, too,"" Schilling told Fox News Digital. ""You have a lot of families that are hurting, they're struggling to put food on the table,"" Schilling said. ""They're struggling to be able to afford to send their kids to a decent school where they can learn to read and write properly, and they're scrapping all their pains together, and then they see that their government is paying to give people that committed very serious crimes that are in federal prisons, sex change procedures that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.""""When you go to prison, you have to lose some rights, and it was an issue that really resonated,"" he continued. ""Trump gets so much credit. I have heard from several people that that maniac-madman-genius actually came up with that closing line of, 'Kamala Harris is for they/them, Donald Trump's for you.' He's so good at the branding.""Schilling said there was record-breaking fundraising for his organization this year, noting a 50% increase from the previous year, growing from $12 million to $18 million. He highlighted that this funding has driven extensive research, ad production, and messaging guidance, which has reportedly influenced Republicans to focus on transgender issues in campaign ads. According to Schilling, Republicans spent over $215 million on ads targeting transgender issues.Last year, Schilling's organization produced an ad featuring women's activist Riley Gaines advocating for candidate Daniel Cameron against Democrat Andy Beshear for governor in Kentucky. In August 2023, APP released a post-2022 election report, titled, ""The Failed Red Wave: Lessons from the GOP Letdown,"" arguing that Republicans performed poorly in part because they failed to take advantage of Democrats' cultural extremism on transgender issues.This summer, APP announced an $18 million ad campaign exposing Kamala Harris and other Democrats' stances on transgender issues.""We spent over seven figures on polling and focus groups and message testing, and we've been passing it out, beating our heads against the wall with candidates up and down the ballot. And 2024 was the year that it finally broke through,"" Schilling said. The ads came during a time during the election cycle where several actions by the Biden-Harris administration gave the messaging a boost. In June, health officials in the Biden administration urged international transgender health nonprofit, World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), to omit the age limit in its guidelines for transgender surgical procedures for adolescents – and succeeded – according to unsealed court documents.More than a dozen states in the U.S. have enacted bans on surgical procedures and hormonal prescriptions for transgender youth. Idaho, North Dakota, Florida, Oklahoma and Alabama have passed laws making it a felony to perform sex changes on children. Several blue states, meanwhile, have enacted ""sanctuary state"" laws in recent years shielding medical providers from facing penalties for conducting transgender procedures on adolescents. Trump's success in reaching people in this issue hasn't come without its opposition. The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union pledged ""to combat"" the forthcoming Trump administration's proposed policies on critical issues such as abortion, border security and LGBTQ rights.The left-wing civil liberties organization launched 434 legal challenges against President Trump during his first term, and will continue during his second term, according to Romero's open letter. They plan, for example, to use the courts to ""invalidate Trump administration policies"" impacting the gay and transgender communities, such as actions that keep biological males out of women's bathrooms or that prevent them from playing on women's sports teams.",8-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-they-them-ads-combined-culture-war-economic-worries-make-effective-pitch-expert
Jordan demands Smith retain all records related to Trump prosecutions as special counsel's office winds down,"The House Judiciary Committee is concerned that special counsel Jack Smith and prosecutors involved in the investigations of now President-elect Donald Trump will ""purge"" records to skirt oversight and is demanding they produce to Congress all documents related to the probes before the end of the month, Fox News Digital has learned. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., penned a letter to Smith on Friday, obtained by Fox News Digital. ""The Committee on the Judiciary is continuing its oversight of the Department of Justice and the Office of Special Counsel. According to recent public reports, prosecutors in your office have been ‘gaming out legal options’ in the event that President Donald Trump won the election,"" they wrote. ""With President Trump’s decisive victory this week, we are concerned that the Office of Special Counsel may attempt to purge relevant records, communications, and documents responsive to our numerous requests for information."" Jordan and Loudermilk warned that the Office of Special Counsel ""is not immune from transparency or above accountability for its actions."" ""We reiterate our requests, which are itemized in the attached appendix and incorporated herein, and ask that you produce the entirety of the requested material as soon as possible but no later than November 22, 2024,"" they wrote. Jordan and Loudermilk are demanding Smith turn over information about the use of FBI personnel on his team — a request first made in June 2023 — and whether any of those FBI employees ""previously worked on any other matters concerning President Trump."" They also renewed their request from August 2023, demanding records relating to Smith and prosecutor Jay Bratt visiting the White House or Executive Office of the President; a request from September 2023 for records related to lawyer Stanley Woodward—who represented Trump aide Walt Nauta; a request from December 2023 for communications between Attorney General Merrick Garland and the special counsel’s team; and more. The Justice Department is looking to wind down two federal criminal cases against President-elect Trump as he prepares to be sworn in for a second term in the White House — a decision that upholds a long-standing policy that prevents Justice Department attorneys from prosecuting a sitting president. DOJ officials have cited a memo from the Office of Legal Counsel filed in 2000, which upholds a Watergate-era argument that asserts it is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for the Justice Department to investigate a sitting president. It further notes that such proceedings would ""unduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the conduct of the Presidency.""  ""In light of the effect that an indictment would have on the operations of the executive branch, ‘an impeachment proceeding is the only appropriate way to deal with a President while in office,’"" the memo said in conclusion.Smith was leading an investigation into the alleged retention of classified records. Trump pleaded not guilty to the charges stemming from that probe. The case was eventually tossed completely by a federal judge in Florida, who ruled that Smith was improperly and unlawfully appointed as special counsel. Smith also took over an investigation into alleged 2020 election interference. Trump also pleaded not guilty, but his attorneys took the fight to the U.S. Supreme Court to argue on the basis of presidential immunity. The high court ruled that Trump was immune from prosecution for official presidential acts, forcing Smith to file a new indictment. Trump pleaded not guilty to those new charges as well. Trump attorneys are now seeking to have the election interference charges dropped in Washington, D.C., similarly alleging that Smith was appointed unlawfully.

What Stefanik's House tenure reveals about what type of UN ambassador she may be,"New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who hammered elite university leaders for their handling of anti-Israel agitators who stormed college campuses in the last year, will be nominated to serve as President-elect Donald Trump's ambassador to the U.N. ""I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,"" Trump said in comment provided to Fox News Digital. A person with direct knowledge of the matter additionally confirmed to Fox News Digital that Trump has chosen the New York Republican for the role.Stefanik is a longtime Trump ally who has chaired the House Republican Conference since 2021, serving as the fourth-most powerful Republican in the House. She was first elected to the House in blue New York in 2014 at the age of 30, making her the youngest woman elected to the House at the time. In the last year alone, Stefanik has been a conservative firebrand who grilled ""morally bankrupt"" college leaders over their handling of antisemitism on campus following Hamas attacking Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. ""Northwestern, Rutgers and UCLA negotiated with pro-Hamas terrorist encampments, bent the knee to the radical antisemitic mob and surrendered their campuses to illegal antisemitic encampments while repeatedly ignoring the harassment and violence against Jewish students and faculty,"" Stefanik told Fox News Digital back in May as she was set to grill another group of college leaders. ""House Republicans will use every  tool at our disposal to ensure accountability from campus leadership for allowing self-proclaimed terrorists to turn once acclaimed American colleges into dens of antisemitic hate.""During last year's college school year, agitators and student protesters flooded college campuses nationwide to protest the war in Israel, which also included spiking instances of antisemitism and Jewish students publicly speaking out that they do not feel safe on some campuses. Radicals on Columbia University’s campus, for example, took over the school's Hamilton Hall building, while schools such as UCLA, Harvard and Yale worked to clear spiraling student encampments where protesters demanded their elite schools completely divest from Israel.Terrorist organization Hamas launched a war in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which initially fanned the flames of antisemitism on campuses in the form of protests, menacing graffiti and students reporting that they felt as if it was ""open season for Jews on our campuses."" The protests then heightened to the point Jewish students at some schools, including Columbia, were warned to leave campus for their own safety. Stefanik has served as a leading voice against antisemitism, including taking victory laps when University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and Harvard President Claudine Gay resigned from their positions amid widespread backlash for waffling in their answers to Stefanik during a House hearing last year. Stefanik grilled Magill and Gay in December regarding whether ""calling for the genocide of Jews"" violates the respective school’s codes of conduct. The pair were both unable to provide direct answers.""It can be, depending on the context,"" Gay responded.""Antisemitic speech when it crosses into conduct that amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation – that is actionable conduct, and we do take action,"" Gay said when pressed to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" if calls for the genocide of Jews breaks school rules. ""So the answer is yes, that calling for the genocide of Jews violates Harvard code of conduct, correct?"" Stefanik asked.""Again, it depends on the context,"" Gay said.""It does not depend on the context. The answer is yes and this is why you should resign,"" Stefanik responded. ""These are unacceptable answers across the board.""Magill answered similarly during the hearing, with both issuing apologies following outrage from Jewish groups, the public and lawmakers that the school presidents could not unequivocally answer Stefanik's questions. The pair subsequently resigned from their Ivy League jobs as outrage mounted""One down. Two to go,"" Stefanik posted after their resignations. ""This is only the very beginning of addressing the pervasive rot of antisemitism that has destroyed the most ‘prestigious’ higher education institutions in America. This forced resignation of the president of @Penn is the bare minimum of what is required. These universities can anticipate a robust and comprehensive Congressional investigation of all facets of their institutions negligent perpetration of antisemitism including administrative, faculty, funding, and overall leadership and governance.""Stefanik continued grilling college administrators in other hearings, and has also publicly lambasted anti-Israel protests that have cropped up, including when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the United States in July and Vice President Kamala Harris skipping his address to Congress. ""Kamala Harris' embarrassing snub of @netanyahu's Joint Address to Congress was a stunt to appease the pro-Hamas base of the Democrat Party that just burned American flags, clashed with police, and spread dangerous pro-terror chaos and violence. Why won’t Kamala disavow these antisemitic terrorist sympathizers?"" Stefanik posted to her X account of Harris. The vice president ultimately did condemn the protests in July during Netanyahu's visit to the U.S., and met with Netanyahu one-on-one after skipping his address to Congress. Stefanik also supported Trump amid his Manhattan criminal trial, where he was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree in May. Trump has maintained his innocence in the case, calling the trial a ""witch hunt"" and ""scam"" promoted by Democrats to hamper his campaign for the White House. ""Today’s verdict shows how corrupt, rigged, and unAmerican the weaponized justice system has become under Joe Biden and Democrats. I fully support President Trump appealing this decision and look forward to a higher New York Court to deliver justice and overturn this verdict,"" Stefanik told Fox Digital following the verdict. ""The facts are clear: this was a zombie case illegally brought forward by a corrupt prosecutor doing Joe Biden’s political bidding in a desperate attempt to save Joe Biden’s failing campaign,"" she continued. Stefanik also railed against the presiding judge in the case, Juan Merchan, filing ethics complaints against him for an alleged conflict of interest pertaining to his daughter’s role at a firm known for representing Democratic politicians. She filed ethics complaints in both May and September, with the most recent complaint alleging Merchan's daughter's consulting firm was working with the Harris campaign. ""On August 20, 2024, Vice President Harris’s campaign submitted its first Federal Election Commission (FEC) report that documented expenses and donations through July 31, 2024. In the report... a July 30, 2024, disbursement appears in the amount of $468.00 from Vice President Harris’s campaign to Authentic Campaigns Inc. (Authentic) for web hosting services,"" Stefanik wrote in her complaint. ""This indicates that one of the very first things that Harris did upon taking over the Biden campaign infrastructure is to hire this firm, Authentic.""""Authentic is a digital consulting and marketing firm that services Democrat candidates. Loren Merchan, Justice Merchan’s daughter, is its president,"" Stefanik added.Under Trump's first administration, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former diplomat Kelly Craft served as U.N. ambassadors.The U.N. is currently bracing for a shake-up following Trump's massive win last week over Harris. ""They will have to recalibrate now very much again in the Trump administration that will, I believe, be much more attentive, engaged and monitoring of the U.N.,"" predicted Hugh Dugan, a longtime member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N., Fox Digital previously reported. ""There are teams there that have been sleepwalking the last few years without U.S. pressure on accountability, efficiency and effectiveness.""The U.N. will elect its next secretary general in 2026, when Trump will be back in the Oval Office and the U.S. has veto power over candidates. ""Over the next year and a half, it's going to make an effort to look more managerially competent to avoid some of the stern green eyes seated across here – attention that Elon Musk and the Trump team will want to bring to the consideration of the secretary general selection.""In addition to the anticipated U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords and the U.N. Global Compact on Migration, the Trump administration is expected to make financial cuts to the U.N., following his cuts to the international body during his first term. ""There's no doubt the U.N. is frightened and horrified,"" of Trump taking office, said Hillel Neuer, executive director of U.N. Watch. ""We're going to see budget cuts,"" he said. ""The most memorable being UNRWA."" Stefanik has shown herself as a fervent ally of Trump's, who does not shy away from sparring with liberals or railing against what she views as corruption or mismanagement, likely teeing up fireworks for her role as U.N. ambassador. ""I am truly honored to earn President Trump's nomination to serve in his Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,"" Stefanik told the New York Post, which first reported on the nomination Sunday. ""During my conversation with President Trump, I shared how deeply humbled I am to accept his nomination and that I look forward to earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate. President Trump’s historic landslide election has given hope to the American people and is a reminder that brighter days are ahead — both at home and abroad.""

"Moderate Republicans buck Cheney, throw support behind Trump","Moderate Republicans broke heavily for President-elect Trump despite the efforts of opponents such as Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney.Trump carried Republicans who didn’t identify as a ""MAGA Republican"" 74%-22% nationwide in Tuesday’s election, according to Fox News voter analysis.The result comes as Vice President Kamala Harris spent much of the last few weeks of the campaign making an appeal to moderate Republicans, hoping to siphon off votes from members of the party who have typically attempted to distance themselves from Trump and his ""Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.""At the center of Harris’ campaign to appeal to those Republicans was Cheney, a former GOP lawmaker who became infamous for having public clashes with Trump during his first term as president.Cheney hit the trail with Harris in late October, including a three-state battleground tour in which Cheney stressed her opposition to Trump as a constitutional conservative.""I would say, I don't know if anybody's more conservative than I am. And I understand the most conservative value there is to defend the Constitution,"" Cheney said during a stop in the battleground state of Michigan when explaining her opposition to the nominee of her own party.Joining Cheney in the Republican movement to endorse Harris was her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, as well as former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, and former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake. Prominent Republicans such as former President George W. Bush and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, also declined to endorse Trump’s bid for president, though neither opted to offer an endorsement of Harris.Nevertheless, Republican voters in battleground states who identified as not MAGA Republicans largely mirrored the national numbers, overwhelmingly throwing their support behind Trump.Such voters broke for Trump in the largest numbers in Georgia, with 82% of non-MAGA Republicans supporting Trump compared to 16% who supported Harris. Nevada saw the least support for Trump among members of the group in battleground states, with 68% of non-MAGA Republicans supporting Trump and 26% supporting Harris.Cheney acknowledged the results of the election in a social media post Wednesday, calling for people to accept the results.""Our nation’s democratic system functioned last night and we have a new President-elect. All Americans are bound, whether we like the outcome or not, to accept the results of our elections,"" Cheney said.Representatives for Cheney did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/moderate-republicans-buck-cheney-throw-support-behind-trump
'Doomed': Experts say this crucial campaign decision led to VP Harris' 'disastrous' defeat,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ failed presidential bid has political strategists second guessing many of her campaign choices, including her selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.""The choice of Walz was only one of many disastrous mistakes but symptomatic of one larger problem — the Democratic Party leadership is too scared to say no to the hard-left progressive wing of the party,"" Julian Epstein, longtime Democratic operative and former chief counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Digital.""This hard left opposes commonsense solutions that [Pennsylvania] Gov. [Josh] Shapiro supports — charter schools, for example. Or defeating terrorists rather than aping their talking points and positions, which allow them to stay in power and rearm for the next genocidal attack,"" Epstein continued. ""It’s the hard-left progressive wing that looks first to welfare and redistribution rather than economic growth, and to cultural extremism on migration and gender deeply out of touch with the American electorate. Walz was a really bad choice for sure, but their choice was part of a deeper problem.""Rob Bluey, president and executive editor of The Daily Signal, told Fox News Digital that Walz being added to the ticket was a significant error in judgment.""Historically, vice presidents have little impact on a presidential candidate’s fate,"" Bluey said. ""But in the case of Tim Walz, it proved to be a disastrous decision that doomed Kamala Harris from the moment she made it. Not only was Walz ill-prepared for the national spotlight and media scrutiny, but Harris passed over several better options. Given how little Americans knew about Harris or her policy positions, they were right to question her judgment on this big decision.""Harris faced scrutiny even from some in her own party over her decision to name Walz, who many view as further to the left than she is, rather than a more moderate choice. Prominent Democrat Shapiro, governor of the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania that Trump carried on Tuesday night, was viewed by some as a more practical choice.""One of the things that are top of mind is the choice of Tim Walz as vice presidential candidate,"" Harris-Walz surrogate Lindy Li told Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich at Howard University. ""A lot of people are saying tonight that it should have been Josh Shapiro. Frankly, people have been saying that for months.""""I know a lot of people are probably wondering tonight what would have happened had Shapiro been on the ticket,"" Li continued. ""And not only in terms of Pennsylvania. He's famously a moderate. So that would have signaled to the American people that she is not the San Francisco liberal that Trump said she was.""Walz was heavily criticized on the campaign trail over questions about his honesty regarding his military service, ties to China, response to the George Floyd riots in 2020, and policy agenda as governor that several Minnesotans who spoke to Fox News Digital described as radical.Firehouse Strategies founding partner Alex Conant told Fox News Digital that while Walz did not help the ticket, the problems were much deeper.""Democrats must have a lot of regrets,"" Conant said. ""Walz didn't help the ticket, but he's not why she lost. VP candidates just don't matter that much.""""Bigger issues were Trump's well-run campaign, Biden's unpopular record, and Harris' lackluster performance as a candidate — and I'm not sure how she could have changed any of those things.""",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doomed-experts-say-crucial-decision-led-harris-disastrous-defeat
Trump HHS could reverse Biden-Harris policies on gender treatments for minors,"While President-elect Donald Trump has yet to announce who will be at the helm of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), he has indicated several steps he would take to slash ""gender-affirming"" care for minors across the country.In a video posted to Truth Social in February 2023, Trump said his plan ""to stop the chemical, physical and emotional mutilation of our youth"" would involve issuing an executive order directing all federal agencies to halt any programs that support or promote sex changes at any age.""I will then ask Congress to permanently stop federal taxpayer dollars from being used to promote or pay for these procedures and pass a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states,"" Trump said in the video.Trump announced plans to ban any hospital or healthcare provider involved in gender-transition treatments for minors from participating in Medicaid and Medicare. He also pledged to support legal actions allowing affected individuals to sue doctors who performed these procedures on minors.""The Department of Justice will investigate Big Pharma and the big hospital networks to determine whether they have deliberately covered up horrific long-term side effects of sex transitions in order to get rich at the expense of vulnerable patients,"" Trump added.Trump honed in on transgender issues during the last leg of his campaign with a successful ad that focused on men in women's sports and Vice President Kamala Harris' track record of ushering in sex change procedures for incarcerated people in California.""Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you,"" the narrator of Trump's campaign ad said. Experts say the TV spot had a substantial influence on swing voters.Over the last four years, the Biden-Harris administration used federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, to expand access to surgical procedures for minors. Under Biden, HHS created a regulation that interpreted ""sex discrimination"" within the Affordable Care Act to include gender identity and sexual orientation.The expanded definition under Title IX meant that any medical provider not offering sex change procedures for any age was at risk of losing federal funding under the Biden-Harris regulation. The rule was blocked by the Supreme Court in August. In June, health officials in the Biden administration urged the international transgender health nonprofit, World Professional Association for Transgender Health, to omit the age limit in its guidelines for transgender surgical procedures for adolescents – and succeeded – according to unsealed court documents.More than 25 states in the U.S. have enacted bans and restrictions on surgical procedures and hormonal prescriptions for transgender youth. Roughly 24 states still permit gender transition surgeries and drugs for children.In recent days, Trump has been announcing his administration's appointments much quicker than he did during his first term. HHS candidates Fox News Digital has learned include Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Eric Hargan, former HUD Secretary Ben Carson, Seema Verma, Paul Mango, Joseph Ladapo, Roger Severino, Brian Blase and Joe Grogan.Fox News Digital has reached out to the Trump-Vance transition team for comment.",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hhs-could-reverse-biden-harris-policies-gender-treatments-minors
Why the media waited till now to admit Harris ran a lousy campaign,"Something suddenly struck me as I tracked all the finger-pointing and blame-shifting over Kamala Harris losing badly to Donald Trump.As we watched her 107-day campaign, most of the coverage was absolutely glowing, as she was depicted as an inspiring trailblazer who would unify the country.But about five minutes after Donald Trump was declared president-elect, a very different portrait emerged.Harris had run an awful campaign, making all sorts of missteps and blunders. She hadn’t done this, that and the other thing. She wasn’t up to the challenge. She couldn’t meet the moment.Now they tell us?Doesn’t this suggest that the journalists, commentators and analysts were covering for her? That they knew the vice president was faltering, flubbing and failing, and weren’t being straight about it?Well, here’s what that brings to mind.For most of his term, President Biden was portrayed as a competent chief executive, maybe lacking pizazz, but more than capable of getting things done, whether you liked his policies or not.Some age-related stories surfaced earlier this year, but both White House officials and those covering Biden assured readers and viewers that he was, in one phrase,""sharp as a tack.""And then came the debate. Boom! The country saw the president struggling to form coherent sentences against Trump, and he would soon be pressured out of the race.At that point, many media figures said sure, they had seen Biden’s mental acuity decline, and yes, he had often been hidden from them, but wasn’t it obvious? A few said White House officials had told them as long as two years earlier that there was no way Biden was capable of running for reelection. But of course that was off the record.In short, even as the president was looking confused or turning the wrong way, much of the press covered for him.And you wonder why the media’s credibility ratings are in the toilet.In the case of Harris, just as in the case of Biden, many journalists obscured the harsh reality of their problems until it was no longer in their interest to do so.We’re getting a major dose of this because of all the sniping between the Harris and Biden camps.""Democrats are directing their rage over losing the presidential race at Joe Biden, who they blame for setting up Kamala Harris for failure by not dropping out sooner,"" Politico reports.""They say his advancing age, questions over his mental acuity and deep unpopularity put Democrats at a sharp disadvantage. They are livid that they were forced to embrace a candidate who voters had made clear they did not want — and then stayed in the race long after it was clear he couldn’t win.""On the same site, columnist Jonathan Martin says ""the Biden sympathizers want to pin her loss on, well, her. And the Harris defenders believe Biden’s undeniably at fault for creating the forbidding political environment she proved unable to overcome.""How can Harris’s defenders grumble about being dragged down by Biden when she could not find one substantive policy issue on which to break from the unpopular incumbent?""What’s more, ""where was the daring? There was no full-throated attempt at defensive politics and reassuring the country she’d govern from the center and reject extremists in both parties…If the other side assails you as a liberal without any clear and sustained response, well, voters will believe the attacks. Given the scale of difficulty she faced — and, yes, how bad that initial, internal polling was — why not take some risks?""Now there were some suggestions, including from me, that Harris was being too cautious and sticking to talking points. I argued from the day she passed over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro that Tim Walz would do nothing for the ticket; now many pundits are simply stating that as fact. One exception to the wait-till-it’s-over approach is this mid-October piece in Axios:""Many senior Biden aides remain wounded by the president being pushed out of his reelection bid and are still adjusting to being in a supportive role on the campaign trail…Some on the Harris team say that top White House aides aren’t sufficiently coordinating Biden’s messaging and schedule to align with what’s best for the vice president’s campaign.""The media have plenty to answer for in the wake of this election, including how they underestimated Trump’s chances and appeal to voters, and failed to grasp why Harris’ party seemed out of touch to many in the working class. But painting a rosy scenario when things were actually dark for Harris – even if there’s nothing she could have done to stop the Trump juggernaut – ranks right up there.",8-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-media-waited-till-now-admit-harris-ran-lousy-campaign

Texas politicos launch full-court press against Harris ahead of her border state campaign rally: 'Apologize',"More than a dozen Texas Republicans, from the governor to members of the U.S. House, slammed Vice President Kamala Harris’ planned visit to the border state Friday, telling Fox News Digital the visit is ""one of the dumbest political decisions"" they've seen. ""'Border Czar' Kamala Harris can come all the way to Houston where Jocelyn Nungaray was killed by Tren de Aragua gang members that she let into the country, yet she can't be bothered to visit Jocelyn's family or even say her name. Kamala Harris and her open border policies have allowed over 11 million illegal immigrants and dangerous criminals like TdA into our country, putting every American's life at risk,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told Fox News Digital. ""President Donald Trump has shown real leadership on the border, with successful border policies that decreased illegal immigration to the lowest level in decades. While Kamala Harris refuses to take real action on this crisis, Texas will continue to step up with our historic border mission until we have a partner in the White House to make America secure again."" Harris will travel to the red state just 10 days ahead of Election Day, and she is expected to speak about the state's abortion policies after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Abortion is a hallmark of the Harris campaign, including Harris saying she supports eliminating the filibuster in an effort to pass a law restoring abortion access nationwide. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick slammed Harris’ trip to Texas as ""one of the dumbest political decisions I’ve ever seen."" ""Kamala Harris coming to Texas for a rally is one of the dumbest political decisions I’ve ever seen. She and Colin Allred are not going to win in Texas. I’m glad she is spending the day in Texas instead of campaigning in a swing state with only a few days left in the election. I hope she stays longer. Donald Trump is going to be the next president because the voters are fed up with the Harris-Biden regime and the chaos they’ve created,"" Patrick said. Harris will be joined by Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred, who is making a long-shot run to unseat longtime Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz slammed his Senate opponent in comments to Fox Digital, saying Allred and Harris share the same ""radical policies.""  ""Colin Allred is Kamala Harris. They have spent the last four years working hand-in-hand against Texans and the American people with their radical policies, whether those be pushing to allow boys in girls' sports, allowing dangerous illegal aliens to come into our country or trying to destroy the oil and gas industry in Texas,"" Cruz said. ""Colin and Kamala share an agenda, and now they'll share a stage for all Texans to see.""""I’m glad she is spending the day in Texas instead of campaigning in a swing state with only a few days left in the election. I hope she stays longer.""  — Texas Lt. Gov. Dan PatrickAs illegal immigration spiraled in 2021, the Biden-Harris administration’s first year in office, President Biden announced Harris would lead the effort to determine the ""root causes"" of immigration. The administration pointed to issues such as climate change, poverty and violence driving migrants to the U.S. The media and Republicans dubbed Harris the ""border czar"" shortly after, with the White House rejecting the title. The moniker, however, has continued years later, including Texas Republicans this week using it to slam Harris ahead of her visit. ""Millions of migrants have illegally entered our country on Border Czar Kamala Harris’ watch, so it’s no surprise that she’d rather talk about anything but her abysmal track record on the border. If she can’t control the border, how can she run the country? We’ve never had a more secure border than under President Trump, and he will put a stop to this when he takes office. Nov. 5 can’t come soon enough,"" Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. ""Harris’ last-ditch effort to appear serious on border security is more than laughable, it’s dangerous. If she were serious, she would’ve acted as a legitimate ‘Border Czar.’ Instead, she imported over 20 million illegals into our communities where they're rewarded with government benefits, leaving U.S. citizens to be raped and murdered by violent illegal criminals,"" Rep. Ronny Jackson said. ""Harris admitted that she’s pro-mass amnesty and has gone so far as to support taxpayer-funded transition surgeries for detained illegals. She is the ultimate panderer, and, if elected, will continue her open-border policies. Texans, including our incredible Latino community, do not trust her, which is why they’re projected to turn out in record numbers to vote for Trump.""Nineteen Texas leaders submitted comments to Fox News Digital slamming Harris’ planned visit, with a handful citing girls and women who have been murdered in recent years, allegedly at the hands of illegal immigrants.  ""Harris should visit Houston, but not to campaign. She should come to apologize for purposefully allowing Texas border counties to be overrun and allowing young Houstonians like Jocelyn Nungaray to be murdered by the people she allowed in,"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw said. Twelve-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was sexually assaulted and murdered by strangulation when two illegal immigrants in their 20s allegedly lured the young girl under a bridge before killing her in June. ""Instead of coming to Texas to ask for our votes, Kamala should be asking for our forgiveness. Especially from the family of Jocelyn Nungaray and the countless others devastated by her administration’s open border policies. For four years, she has ignored Texans and the deadly crisis she has created at our southern border,"" Rep. Roger Williams said. ""Her negligence as Border Czar contributed to the tragic deaths of Americans, including Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed by two illegal aliens from Venezuela. Young women like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin would be alive today if Kamala Harris had taken her responsibilities seriously,"" Rep. Wesley Hunt added. Harris’ event will kick off Friday evening in Houston, with reports surfacing that she will be joined by singer-songwriter Beyoncé, who is originally from Houston. ""If she wanted a secure border, why did I have to sue her administration dozens of times to force them to follow federal immigration laws?"" — Ken Paxton, Texas attorney generalThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the Texas Republicans' comments on her upcoming visit. The campaign also did not respond to a request for confirmation regarding whether Beyoncé will join the rally. Harris joined a CNN town hall on Wednesday evening outside Philadelphia, where moderator Anderson Cooper pressed the vice president about her border policies, including whether she supports a border wall after calling the wall ""stupid"" when it was championed by Trump during his administration. ""Let's talk about this compromise bill that you want to pass if you are elected. You said that's going to be a priority. It includes $650 million in funding for the border wall. That's something Republicans wanted, that was part of the compromise. Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. You called it ‘stupid, useless, and a medieval vanity project.’ Is a border wall stupid?"" Cooper asked Harris. ""Let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall,"" Harris said while laughing. ""So, remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it. Come on, they didn't. How much of that wall did he build? I think the last number I saw was about 2%. And then when it came time for him to do a photo op, you know where he did it? In the part of the wall that President Obama built.""""But you agreed to a bill that would earmark $650 million to continue building that wall,"" Cooper pressed. ""I pledge that I am going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen and secure our border. Yes, I am, and I'm going to work across the aisle to pass a comprehensive bill that deals with a broken immigration system,"" Harris responded. ""So you don't think it's stupid anymore?"" Cooper continued. ""I think what [Trump] did and how he did it was… did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. I just talked about that wall, right? We just talked about it. He didn't actually do much of anything,"" she responded. ""Young women like Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin would be alive today if Kamala Harris had taken her responsibilities seriously."" — Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-TexasTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton railed against Harris in comments to Fox Digital ahead of her visit, saying she and President Biden ""intentionally dismantled every successful Trump border policy to let in as many aliens as possible"" starting on their first day in office. ""Now, Kamala wants to come to Texas and talk about border security after four years of destroying American communities. If she wanted a secure border, why did I have to sue her administration dozens of times to force them to follow federal immigration laws? We’re fighting Kamala’s destructive open-borders doctrine in the courts because she has unlawfully weaponized power to make our country more dangerous instead of keeping Americans safe,"" Paxton said. ""Now, Texas is fighting Kamala’s obvious effort to allow noncitizens to vote illegally in American elections. We need to end the insanity, secure the border, restore the rule of law and put American citizens first again by re-electing President Trump.""

Vice President Harris reportedly to give closing argument next week on National Mall in DC,"Vice President Kamala Harris will deliver her closing presidential campaign argument in an address next week in the nation's capital, her campaign announced on Wednesday.According to a senior campaign official, Harris will deliver what's being described as a major ""closing argument"" address next Tuesday - one week until Election Day - on the Ellipse, which is just south of the White House and north of the National Mall.The campaign spotlighted that then-President Trump headlined a large rally of supporters at the Ellipse on Jan 6, 2021. Many of those who attended Trump's rally then marched to the U.S. Capital and joined other protesters in storming the building in an attempt to upend congressional certification of President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump.The campaign official said in her speech, Harris will make the case that it's time to turn the page on Trump and chart a new path forward. The official added that the vice president's speech will aim to contrast what a Harris term in the White House would look like compared to another four years of a Trump presidency.The campaign sees the Ellipse as a symbolic location that they believe will help make clear to voters the choice in the presidential election. Trump and Harris are locked in a margin-of-error battle in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House.Trump, who has been indicted multiple times and made history as the first current or former president convicted in a criminal case, has regularly said during the 2024 campaign that if he returned to the White House, he would prosecute his political foes.And both Biden and Harris - who replaced her boss atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in July after Biden ended his re-election bid - have repeatedly warned voters that Trump poses a threat to democracy if he's re-elected.""Our democracy is at stake,"" the president said on Tuesday. ""Think about it. Think about what would happen if Donald Trump wins this election.""Word of the Harris address in the nation's capital was first reported earlier on Wednesday by NBC News.",23-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vice-president-harris-reportedly-give-closing-argument-next-week-national-mall-dc

Kennedy's efforts to get his name removed from ballots in Michigan have been unsuccessful, with the Michigan Supreme Court ruling against the move this fall.The poll comes as Harris' lead in a Reuters national poll has shrunk to just one point, with the vice president sitting at 44% to Trump's 43%.The Tuesday poll found Harris's lead had shrunk compared to a poll conducted earlier in October that showed her with a two-point lead.The Reuters poll surveyed 1,150 U.S. adults across the country, including 975 registered voters.The poll also found Harris slipping on some of her key issues, such as voters' concerns about extremism and threats to democracy. A Reuters poll earlier in October found that she had a 7-point lead over Trump on the issue, but the Tuesday poll found that lead shrank to just 2%.Wednesday's poll comes after another USA Today poll found Harris and Trump locked in another dead heat in Wisconsin on Monday.

These 3 Trump policies will help fix America’s broken economy,"Donald Trump and congressional Republicans won big on Tuesday night, recapturing the White House and Senate while still on track to maintain control of the House of Representatives.But the biggest winner of Tuesday’s contests is the American people, who continue to suffer from the Biden-Harris administration’s reckless economic policies.The cost of everyday goods and services, including gasoline and groceries, remains substantially higher than they were when Trump left office.Rent and home prices have also skyrocketed. The average cost of a home has increased by more than $100,000 since the fourth quarter of 2020, and mortgage rates have more than doubled since the start of 2021.Personal debt, including credit card and car debt, has also risen substantially.President-elect Trump has a bold vision to turn the economy around, and beginning in January 2025, he and his fellow Republicans in Congress will have an opportunity to enact their sweeping reforms.Below are three of the most important economic policies that Americans can expect to see from Trump once the Biden-Harris administration ends.1. Tax Cuts for Working-Class Americans and RetireesIn addition to restoring, numerous business tax provisions that were included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Trump has proposed a series of tax reductions specifically designed to help middle- and lower-income workers and retired Americans.For example, Trump plans to exempt Social Security benefits from federal income tax.He has also proposed exempting overtime pay and income from tips, a significant boost for many working-class families.Additionally, Trump wants to create an itemized deduction for auto loan interest, a policy that will lower taxes for filers with debt from a car loan. However, because many middle- and lower-income families do not itemize their taxes, the effect of this policy might not be as beneficial as it looks at first glance.2. Drill Baby, DrillDuring Trump’s first term in office, his administration slashed energy regulations, spurring additional oil and natural gas production. As a result, the United States became a net oil exporter for the first time in 75 years.Gasoline prices also remained below the 10-year average for the duration of the Trump administration's first term. Lower gasoline prices kept prices down for countless other goods and services, because when energy prices rise, the cost of transporting and manufacturing also increases.The Biden administration has taken a completely different approach to energy policy. Instead of supporting domestic oil and natural gas, Biden has increased regulations on those industries, delayed approval for new oil and gas leases, and spent massive amounts of taxpayer money to help so-called ""green"" energy industries, including wind and solar.Trump has promised to reinstitute his pro-energy, America-first policies. If he succeeds, those policies would increase oil and natural gas jobs in the United States, spur national economic growth, and reduce costs throughout the economy.On Trump’s campaign website, he says he plans to ""end Biden’s delays in federal drilling permits and leases that are needed to unleash American oil and natural gas production.""He also promises to ""remove all red tape that is leaving oil and natural gas projects stranded, including speeding up approval of natural gas pipelines into the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and New York.""These and other proposals by the Trump administration will have a massive positive effect on America’s economy, including by helping to further reduce inflation, which has plagued families for most of Biden’s time in office.3. Creating Fair Trade PoliciesNumerous countries around the world, including some of America’s biggest economic rivals, impose tariffs on U.S. products, making it harder for domestic manufacturers and businesses to compete with overseas rivals.To fix this important problem, Trump has proposed legislation called the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act.Under the plan, ""if any foreign country imposes a tariff on American-made goods that is higher than the tariff imposed by the U.S., President Trump will have the authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on that country’s goods.""The proposal would also ""empower President Trump to negotiate the reduction of tariffs on foreign goods if foreign countries agree to reduce their tariffs on American goods.""Pro-liberty economists do not agree about the effectiveness of many kinds of tariffs. Some think imposing more tariffs would have a net-negative impact on the U.S. economy, because tariffs drive up costs for products made overseas. Those costs often get passed along to American consumers.But no matter what one thinks about tariffs generally, there should be no debate on fair trade policies like the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If a foreign country imposes tariffs on American-made goods, the United States should respond with a similar policy of its own.A reciprocal trade policy like the one suggested by Trump would dramatically aid U.S. workers, especially manufacturers, by discouraging foreign countries from continuing their unfair trade practices.Further, the net effect of a such a policy is likely to be fewer tariffs overall, because many foreign producers are dependent on American consumers and would likely choose to eliminate tariffs in order to protect their own manufacturers.Fair trade policies will help U.S. businesses compete with foreign competitors in a way that hasn’t been possible for decades, creating and protecting American jobs.The Biden-Harris administration’s economic agenda has been a disaster for families, which is a big reason why voters chose to re-elect President Trump to a second term.If Trump and congressional Republicans make good on their promise to enact pro-growth, low-tax policies, the economy will soon improve, and the country will thrive for years to come.",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/3-trump-policies-help-fix-americas-broken-economy
Kamala Harris supporter Sally Field trashes campaign sign after Donald Trump victory,"Sally Field did not get what she wanted for her birthday.The actress, who turned 78 on Wednesday, was seen outside her home in Los Angeles the morning after the presidential election, disposing of a sign in support of Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.The ""Steel Magnolias"" star also trashed a sign that read, ""Vote pro-choice, pro-equality, pro-democracy by November 5.""Field emerged from her home looking comfortable, wearing sweatpants and a button-down shirt. With her hair in braids and airpods secured to her ears, she looked like she was ready to get down to business, ripping the signs out from the ground and walking to the garbage and recycling bins on the street.A representative for Field did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.On Tuesday, Field and her son, Sam, both of whom donned Harris-Walz gear, encouraged people to get out and vote. ""Whether you’re a Democrat, a Republican or an Independent - vote for Democracy, for human rights, for women’s rights, for sanity, for hope, for @kamalaharris & @timwalz,"" she wrote on Instagram.Field initially endorsed the current vice president last month while simultaneously making a vulnerable admission about her youth. In an emotional video shared on Instagram, the actress revealed that when she was 17 years old, she had an abortion in Mexico.""I’ve been so hesitant to do this, to tell my horrific story,"" she captioned the video. ""It was during a time even worse than now. A time when contraception was not readily available, and only if you were married. But I feel that so many women of my generation went through similar, traumatic events, and I feel stronger when I think of them. I believe, like me, they must want to fight for their grandchildren and all the young women of this country.""It’s one of the reasons why so many of us are supporting Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Everyone, please, pay attention to this election, up and down the ballot, in every state – especially those with ballot initiatives that could protect reproductive freedom. PLEASE. WE CAN’T GO BACK!!""Field explained that at the time, she had just graduated from high school and ""had nothing,"" including a lack of financial or emotional support from family. When she found out she was pregnant, a friend of the family, who was also a doctor, drove her down to Tijuana to have the procedure. On the journey, she was also accompanied by the doctor's wife and her mother.""It was beyond hideous and you know, life-altering,"" Field explained, saying she went without an anesthetic, only given ""a few puffs of ether"" by a technician, which made her extremities numb. ""But I felt everything of how much pain I was in, and then I realized the technician was actually molesting me. So I had to figure out how can I make my arms move to push him away.""Field remembers feeling ""this absolute pit of shame"" from the whole experience, and that when the procedure was finished, she was rushed out. ""They didn't want me there… it was illegal.""Field says months later she started auditioning for acting roles and ""by the end of that year, I was ‘Gidget.’ I was the quintessential All-American, girl-next-door.""She says in reality, that was an accurate depiction of herself, ""because so many women - my generation of women, were going through this. And these are the things women are going through now. ... It's beyond how you can go back to that. And do that to our little girls and our young women and not have respect and regard for their health and their own decisions, about whether they feel they're able to give birth to a child at that time.""Since the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022, 13 states have enacted a total abortion ban with minimal exceptions, while 28 others have restrictions based on gestational duration.President-elect Trump said throughout his campaign that abortion should be regulated at the state level.",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kamala-harris-supporter-sally-field-trashes-campaign-sign-after-donald-trump-victory
Trump's 'border czar' warns Dem govs rejecting Trump deportation plan: ‘Get the hell out of the way’,"Thomas Homan, who President-elect Donald Trump appointed as ""border czar"" on Sunday night, has a clear message for any Democratic governors who oppose the planned mass deportation operation.""If they're not willing to help, then get the hell out of the way because [Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)] is going to do their job,"" Homan, who was acting ICE director during the first Trump administration, told Fox News Digital in an interview on Friday.Trump announced on Sunday that Homan will be appointed ""border czar"" and would be in charge of the borders and ""all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their country of origin"" in the new administration.Before that announcement, Fox News asked Homan about comments by Democratic governors who have indicated they will not work with the administration on the mass deportation of illegal immigrants.Mass. Gov. Maura Healey said last week that ""every tool in the tool box has got to be used to protect our citizens, to protect our residents and protect our states and to hold the line on democracy and the rule of law as a basic principle.""""No. Absolutely not,"" she said last week when asked if state police would help with deportations.Homan, a Fox News contributor, suspects some ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions will work with the administration.""They’re not going to say it, but with all the alien crime and the young women being sexually assaulted and murdered, some sheriffs have been coming forward and working with us behind the scenes,"" he said.However, while he said it would be useful to have the ""force multiplier"" of assistance from state and local governments, and for agents to have access to county jails where serious illegal immigrant criminals are locked up, he said that a lack of that aid would not stop the operations.""If you don’t want to work with us, then get the hell out all the way, we’re going to do it. What it means is, rather than send 100 people to Boston, we’re going to send 200 agents to Boston. We're going to get the job done,"" he said.""We have a mandate. I think the American people just gave President Trump a mandate. That's why he's elected -- to secure the border, save lives and deport people, especially national security threats and public safety threats. So if you’re not going to help us, step aside, but don't get in our way, because there will be consequences.""Homan said that the immediate focus will be on those illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or charges, as had been the focus under the first Trump administration.""It’s not going to be a massive sweep of neighborhoods, it’s not going to be massive raids. It's going to be a targeted enforcement operation,"" he said.However, he warned that it does not mean anyone is off the table. ""If you're in a country illegally, you've got a problem.""Homan argues that with millions of people having entered illegally across the southern border under the Biden administration, there has to be consequences for those who are found not to have a valid asylum claim, or else there is no true due process.""There will be a massive deportation operation because we had massive never seen before illegal immigration where 90% will be ordered removed. It's common sense,"" he said.He also said that many illegal immigrants will likely leave by themselves when incentives to cross the border are ended. As for how many can be removed, he says that will depend on the resources made available.""It depends on resources, depends on the money. But I guarantee you that President Trump means what he says and there will be a green light to enforce our laws and secure that border. And that's going to require a mass deportation operation,"" he said.Homan, a former New York police officer, Border Patrol agent and ICE chief, had been widely expected to play a key role in the mass deportation operation. A Washington Post article in 2016 said that Homan ""deports people. And he’s really good at it."" Homan said Friday of his potential role in the administration, ""Here's what I'll say. I have not asked for a position. I have certainly not asked for a cabinet position. President Trump knows that if he needs me to do a deportation operation, if he needs me to secure the border. I stand ready to help any way I can. And he'll decide what he wants me to do or if he wants me to do it.""Instead, he emphasized the threat posed at the border and the determination in the upcoming administration to solve it.""The southern border is the biggest national security vulnerability I've seen in my lifetime. It should be a nonpartisan issue. People shouldn't be making death threats against me, hating on me. Securing the border should be a nonpartisan issue,"" he said. ""And we're going to do it ...I don't care what people's opinions are, we're going to get it done.""",11-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-border-czar-warns-dem-govs-rejecting-trump-deportation-plan-get-hell-out-way
RFK Jr. asks Americans to suggest policies for new Trump administration: 'Transition team belongs to YOU',"Just a week after former President Trump won back the presidency, the new administration is quickly forming, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is asking ordinary Americans to make suggestions about what policies and people should be put in place.To facilitate this, close Kennedy allies launched a website called ""Policies for the People"" that allows people to nominate, suggest and vote for the leaders and policies they want to see coming from the Trump White House.Amaryllis Fox, who served as campaign director for Kennedy's 2024 presidential run, posted on X that ""President Trump and RFK want your policy proposals,"" adding that ""the MAGA x MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] transition team belongs to YOU.""The website says that the suggestions will help fill the over 4,000 appointments across the entire executive branch.""President Trump has asked Bobby [Kennedy] to help ‘drain the swamp’ by giving him an influential leadership role on his transition team,"" a post on the website says. ""But Bobby cannot do this alone, so he is now turning to the wisdom and expertise of his supporters – and the larger community.""""Unlike the backroom deals of past presidents, the MAGA/MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] transition team will draw directly from the input of we, the people,"" another part of the website says.There are a dozen categories on the website ranging from ""America’s health"" to education, the economy and the environment. Anyone can register on the site and suggest a policy or person for an executive branch role. Nominees who receive more votes from users are pushed to the top of the suggested list.So far, over 70,500 people have registered on the site and there have been nearly 10,500 policy suggestions. Nominee suggestions for the new administration range from the Department of Defense to national intelligence to health.Mark Gorton, a New York-based executive and Kennedy ally, is one of the driving forces behind the website. He explained to Fox News Digital that the intention of the Policies for the People platform is to create a way for Americans to become more involved with the political decision-making process beyond just voting.Gorton believes that the platform has the potential to help not only the Trump administration, but could also be used by state and local governments to better understand the concerns of their citizens.""Previously, we had a system where most of the interaction with government came from lobbyists and most of the bills in Congress, large parts of them or all of them, are written by lobbyists,"" he said. ""So, the idea is that this would be a crowdsource tool for people in government so that they don't just have to rely on the lobbyists.""While the Policies for the People platform includes many policy categories, Gorton said that, like Kennedy, his focus is primarily on health policy. He chaired the ""American Values"" political action committee that supported Kennedy’s presidential run until Kennedy dropped out to endorse Trump in August. He shares many of the same concerns as Kennedy about corruption within government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which he believes have significant conflicts of interest with the companies they are supposed to regulate.""We tell people, 'If you vote, you've done your job.' I think in a world that, you know, with a much healthier democracy, you have a more active, engaged citizenry who is not just voting, but is also involved in, you know, oversight in very targeted ways,"" he said. ""You can have systems that are different and that aren't riddled with conflicts of interest and really insiders versus outsiders.""While Gorton said that ""taking back control of the health regulatory agencies and making them work for the American people"" is a good slogan, he believes that the Policies for the People platform can help to actually accomplish that goal.""It's one thing to say a high-level slogan like that. It's another thing to go piece by piece into the guts of each of these agencies and, you know, go through the minutia of what it takes to fix the system. And that's exactly where this large, crowdsourced pool of energy can help with that,"" he said.The Policies for the People platform is also receiving approval from long-time health advisers in Republican circles. Avik Roy, a seasoned Republican health policy adviser, told Fox News Digital that he thinks the Policies for the People platform is a ""terrific idea.""""Oftentimes these transitions can be very insider affairs,"" he explained. ""So, the more you can democratize that and make it easy for highly qualified people who are not plugged into Washington already, I think that's terrific.""When it comes to health in the U.S., Roy said that his biggest concern is FDA regulation making innovation much more difficult and, by extension, much more expensive for Americans to get treatments and medicine.But to Dr. Charles Fagenholz, a holistic health practitioner who has been nominated on the platform for a health advisory role, the problem goes even deeper. Fagenholz, who runs a popular online health forum called ""In The Trenches,"" is one of the top nominees on the site. He told Fox News Digital that he believes the changes being discussed by Trump and Kennedy are seriously needed and will have a massive impact on American health and on ending things like chronic disease as well as ADHD and learning deficit disorders among children.   ""We're the most advanced medical society ever in the history of this planet, and we're the sickest country. That is obscene,"" he said.Though Fagenholz believes there is much that people can do on an individual level to improve their health, such as buying organic groceries, drinking spring water and exercising, he said that ""we do need a massive change at the government level.""He agrees with Kennedy that there is massive corruption within government agencies, such as the FDA, and believes that the No. 1 issue affecting Americans’ health is the American food supply, which he said is full of harmful chemicals and pesticides.""The foods that people are eating are toxic, and these administrations or three-letter agencies, as you call them, are a big reason why they're so toxic,"" Fagenholz said. ""Taking something like high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners and dyes, things like that, out of our food and make food real again is probably going to be the biggest bang for our buck as a country in health.""If asked, Fagenholz said that he would be happy to advise the new administration on health policy. The way he sees it is that ""we have four years to get as much done as possible, and so that's full steam ahead.""

"KJP says President Biden still has no plans to pardon Hunter Biden for tax fraud, gun charges","White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Biden still has no plans to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, who pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in September.Hunter's plea spared him from a public trial over his failure to pay taxes while he spent lavishly on drugs, escorts, luxury hotel stays, clothing and other personal items.The plea also came after he was convicted of three felony gun charges in June. The first son, prosecutors said, lied on a mandatory gun purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.After Hunter was convicted of the crimes, President Biden indicated he did not plan to pardon his son.On Thursday, Jean-Pierre was asked again if President Biden had any intentions of pardoning Hunter, who is scheduled to be sentenced on the gun charges on Dec. 12 and the tax fraud charges on Dec. 16.""We’ve been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no,"" the press secretary said.Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich followed up on the question, asking if a commutation, or a lesser sentence, was off the table for Hunter.Heinrich reminded Jean-Pierre that she had previously said Biden would not consider a commutation of Hunter’s sentence.""Yes, that stands,"" Jean-Pierre said.""You’re saying that still stands?"" Heinrich asked for clarification.""Yeah,"" Jean-Pierre responded.The president's son was indicted on three felonies and six misdemeanor counts alleging he evaded paying at least $1.4 million in taxes while simultaneously spending money on ""drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes,"" according to the December 2023 indictment.Prosecutors also allege the tax returns Hunter ultimately did file falsely claimed that things like prostitutes, strip club visits, porn website subscriptions and other personal expenses were actually deductible business expenses.The aim, according to the indictment, was to ""evade assessment of taxes to reduce the substantial tax liabilities"" that Hunter faced.",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kjp-president-biden-no-plans-pardon-hunter-biden-tax-fraud-gun-charges
Who's who on Trump's short list for attorney general,"President-elect Donald Trump has wasted little time in naming top White House and Cabinet officials to serve in his administration as he prepares to be sworn in for a second term in January.It remains to be seen, however, who Trump will pick to head up his Justice Department, perhaps one of the most important vacancies to be filled in the next administration. Early contenders for the post include sitting U.S. senators, former Justice Department personnel and at least one top White House adviser from Trump's first term.Though each would bring widely different backgrounds and perspectives to the position, they all share one common trait: loyalty to the president-elect and a willingness to back his agenda and policies over the next four years. As the U.S. awaits a formal announcement from the president-elect, here are some of the top names being floated for the role of U.S. attorney general.Sen. Mike Lee, R-UtahSen. Mike Lee, R- Utah, is considered to be a more conventional pick to head up the Justice Department. Lee is a high-ranking Republican in the chamber and would face a somewhat easy path to Senate confirmation, at least compared to some of the more controversial names that have surfaced.But he may not be gunning for the role.The Utah Republican told reporters last week that while he has been in frequent conversations with Trump's transition team, he plans to focus his sway in the Republican-majority Senate on helping gin up support for Trump's Cabinet nominees and helping select the Senate majority leader, a leadership election in which Lee, as current chair of the Senate Steering Committee, is poised to a play a major role.""I have the job I want,"" Lee told the Deseret News in an interview. ""And I look forward to working in the next Congress and with President Trump and his team to implement his agenda and the reform agenda that Republicans have offered and campaigned on, and it’s going to be an exciting time. We’ve got a lot of work to do.""John RatcliffeFormer Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe is among the top names being considered to head up the Justice Department. Ratcliffe, a former federal prosecutor and a former U.S. representative from Texas, earned the spotlight during Trump’s first term for his outspoken criticism of the FBI and of the special counsel investigation overseen by Robert Mueller.Trump tapped Ratcliffe in 2019 to replace Dan Coates as the Director of National Intelligence. The following year, he was tapped by the outgoing president to be a member of his impeachment team.Mark Paoletta Former White House attorney Mark Paoletta served during Trump’s first term as counsel to then-Vice President Mike Pence and to the Office of Management and Budget.Paoletta is also already working on the Trump transition team, including helping steer Justice Department policy in the next Trump administration, making him a potentially natural fit for the role.Paoletta also made clear Monday that if tapped to head up the Justice Department, he would not tolerate any resistance to Trump’s agenda by career prosecutors and other nonpolitical officials.In a lengthy post on the social media site, X, Paoletta said career employees are ""required to implement the President’s plan"" after an election, appearing to dismiss fears about plans that career staff may regard as illegal or unethical (though this would be a matter of opinion).""If these career DOJ employees won’t implement President Trump’s program in good faith, they should leave,"" Paoletta said, noting that employees who engage in so-called ""resistance"" to Trump’s agenda would be guilty of ""subverting American democracy,"" and subject to ""disciplinary measures, including termination.""Missouri Attorney General Andrew BaileyMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is also among the names floated to lead the Department of Justice. Bailey was tapped by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson in 2022 to be the state’s top prosecutor after then-state Attorney General Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate.Since taking over the state AG’s office, Bailey has led dozens of lawsuits against the Biden administration and sought to defend the state on a number of conservative issues as well. Those familiar with Bailey’s ascent say his lower-profile career could be an asset as a possible U.S. attorney general, especially since the role requires Senate confirmation. He could be aided here by Sens. Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt, two Missouri Republicans who also served as state attorney general before their Senate service.Since neither appear to be seeking the role of the top U.S. prosector, they could play a key role in stumping for Bailey in the Senate if his name does come up for consideration.Matt WhitakerFormer Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker temporarily led the Justice Department after Trump fired former Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his first term.Asked last week in a Fox News interview whether he wants the role, Whitaker declined to answer, saying that the decision is Trump's to make. ""He's going to want someone who he knows, likes and trusts,"" Whitaker said. ""He's going to want someone who was there from the beginning,"" he added, and who can help defend against what Whitaker described as ""all this lawfare nonsense."" The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to Fox News's request for comment as to who remains on its list of candidates to lead the Justice Department.",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whos-who-trumps-short-list-attorney-general
Rahm Emanuel mulling bid to steer DNC in wake of disastrous election night for Dems,"President Biden's U.S. ambassador to Japan and a longtime Democrat operative is considering a run for chair of the Democratic National Committee, two sources in the DNC orbit confirm to Fox News. The sources tell Fox News that Rahm Emanuel has been quietly reaching out to DNC committee members as he contemplates a bid to succeed the current chair, Jaime Harrison, whose term is up early next year. Harrison is unlikely to seek a second four-year posting in the wake of last week’s very disappointing election results for the Democrats, up and down the ballot.Emanuel, a veteran of President Clinton’s administration, went on to serve in Congress and steered the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during its very successful 2006 cycle. He later served as former President Obama’s chief of staff before winning the 2011 election and 2015 re-election as Chicago mayor. Emanuel has served these past four years as U.S. ambassador to Japan during the Biden administration.Emanuel appears to have a major advocate in veteran Democratic strategist David Axelrod (the political mastermind behind Obama’s 2008 White House victory and 2012 re-election win), who is a friend of his.""If they said, 'Well, what should we do? Who should lead the party?' I would take Ambassador Rahm Emanuel, and I would bring him back from Japan, and I would appoint him chairman of the Democratic National Committee,"" Axelrod said on Tuesday during his podcast, ""Hacks on Tap.""On Wednesday, Axelrod wrote on X that ""Dems need a strong and strategic party leader, with broad experience in comms; fundraising and winning elections. One thought I surfaced on @HacksonTap: Ambassador @RahmEmanuel. There may be others but he is kind of sui genesis: Dude knows how to fight and win!""But it's far from certain, if Emanuel goes ahead with a bid to chair the DNC, that he would be well received by others.One DNC insider, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fox News Digital, ""Rahm is no doubt talented. But we need to know what we need to do to move forward as a party. We need new blood. We need modernization. We need somebody who understands the vastly changed new media landscape, and who is willing to invest in it. Don’t know that Rahm fits the bill for that.""Another DNC insider, who also asked for anonymity, was much more blunt, arguing in a comment to Fox News Digital that ""the absolutely last person we need leading us is an arrogant elitist that has never worked a day in his life.""The news regarding Emanuel was first reported earlier Friday by Axios.",15-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rahm-emanuel-mulling-bid-steer-dnc-disastrous-election-night-dems
'Avengers' stars assemble in roasted Harris ad: 'New cringe just dropped',"Marvel’s ""Avengers: Endgame"" stars reunited in an ad for the Democratic ticket that was mocked as ""new cringe"" for the Harris campaign.Actors Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Danai Gurira, Don Cheadle and Paul Bettany took part in a video endorsement for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz that was posted on Ruffalo’s X account Thursday.""We're back.

A full day of ""self-care"" activities, including yoga classes, ""restorative dialogue,"" and therapy dog ""pawfice"" hours was offered to process the election results on Wednesday at the college.The University of Michigan School of Social Work invited students to attend various post-election events, including an ""empowering art therapy workshop"" to ""process the emotions stirred up by the election season.""At Michigan State University, an ""MSU"" professor went viral after canceling her class to ""grieve"" about the election. ""I am cancelling class today to grieve the presidential election results,"" Borah wrote in a notice later shared on social media. ""As a queer, immigrant woman of color, I cannot, in good conscience, go on about my day like everything is alright.""""This is a major historical event that we are witnessing,"" she continued.

We're headed down a very problematic path: universities are producing a generation that can’t face the uncertainties and challenges of life,"" Sturge told Fox News Digital.""These activities belong at a day care, not an institution of higher learning. Life is hard. It’s full of hard work, hurt feelings, sadness, and tragedy. Our great-grandparents fought through WWII with sacrifice and grit – not with coloring books or puppy petting. They faced obstacles and opposition head on. Universities need to return to preparing the next generation to not only survive in the real world, but to thrive,"" she continued.Some university officials are defending the election activities, arguing we are living in an unprecedented time of division.""I do think the rhetoric that goes around [during] the elections, with the past few election cycles, is really different from what I grew up with… we’re constantly hearing messages that are ‘If you don’t do it this way, everything is over,’"" Kelly Brown, the director of counseling, health and wellness services at the University of Puget Sound, told Inside Higher Ed. ""I don’t think of it as coddling.

"No Trump bump: MSNBC hemorrhaging viewers since Election Day, sheds more than half of primetime audience","MSNBC’s reliably liberal audience has tuned out the anti-Trump network since Election Day with a staggering 54% drop in primetime viewership. MSNBC averaged 1.1 million viewers during the month of October but plummeted to an average audience of 736,000 on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week following President-elect Donald Trump’s historic landslide victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. MSNBC’s remarkable 31% drop comes as Fox News Channel’s viewership grew by 61% over the same time period. MSNBC also shed 26% of its year-to-date totals, but things got even worse in primetime. During the primetime hours of 8-11 p.m. ET, MSNBC averaged 1.8 million total viewers in October but viewership of ""Alex Wagner Tonight,"" ""All in with Chris Hayes"" and ""The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell"" have averaged only 808,000 total viewers since election night. The 54% drop represents more than half of the network’s primetime viewers, and MSNBC is also down 51% from its year-to-date totals while Fox News is up 58% in primetime compared to 2024 averages. MSNBC is also down 16% among total day viewers and 57% during primetime among the critical demographic of adults age 25-54, which is most coveted by advertisers. ""Alex Wagner Tonight,"" ""Andrea Mitchell Reports,"" Chris Jansing Reports,"" ""Deadline: White House"" with Nicolle Wallace, ""Jose Diaz-Balart Reports,"" Joy Reid’s ""The ReidOut"" and ""The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell"" all had their smallest audiences of the year on Friday. It was also the smallest audience for ""Alex Wagner Tonight"" since the show launched in 2022 when MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow rolled back her on-air presence to only once per week. ""All in with Chris Hayes"" had its lowest-rated episode since May 10, 2016 on Thursday. MSNBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A longtime TV news executive who asked to remain anonymous noted that MSNBC’s audience appeared to love to hate Trump during his first administration – but that doesn’t seem to be the case any longer.   ""As its poor post-election night ratings show, MSNBC should not expect a ‘Trump Bump’ this time around. Even liberals are rejecting its condescending tone and the divisive rhetoric of its new standard-bearer, Joy Reid,"" the longtime TV news executive said.MSNBC viewer Sharon Waxman, who is the founder and CEO of Hollywood trade publication TheWrap, wrote that the ""media got it wrong"" and she needs a break from the noise. ""If you’re like me, you haven’t turned on the news since last Tuesday when Donald Trump won the election. Personally, I can’t bear to listen to another minute of wisdom from Joy Reid, my friend Lawrence O’Donnell or the admirable Rachel Maddow,"" Waxman wrote. ""I can’t do it,"" Waxman continued. ""I’m not saying I’ll never watch or listen again. But – am I alone here? – my entire body recoils from listening to more claptrap from the same claptrapping apparatus."" MSNBC personalities have not taken Harris’ loss particularly well, as hosts and pundits have repeatedly tried to assign blame for President-elect Trump’s landslide victory. Stephanie Ruhle said Americans were gambling with the country’s future by choosing Trump as their next president. Claire McCaskill cried on-air after watching Harris' concession speech. Joy Reid essentially blamed White women for Harris’ North Carolina loss and said Black women have ""resigned from the save America coalition."" And Al Sharpton claimed that misogyny and racism among voters may have cost Harris the election. MSNBC host Jonathan Capehard said he was still ""grappling"" with how ""someone was elected that ran a campaign that was openly hostile, openly racist, xenophobic, misogynistic, transphobic"" while MSNBC’s on-screen graphic said ""FINDING HOPE IN A DARK TIME."" Jen Psaki even said the Democratic Party over-relied on ""never-Trump"" Republicans and should've made more of an effort to reach voters who had left the Democratic Party.This rhetoric came after MSNBC spent years promoting ""never-Trump"" Republicans, targeting hardcore Democrats and largely dismissing non-liberals. MSNBC recently touted a ratings victory, noting that the liberal network topped CNN on a presidential election night for the first time in network history. However, NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck feels it was simply an anomaly.  ""While MSNBC thought they may have struck gold with the election night ratings, they should have realized by now that Americans only tuned in so they could see the meltdowns, not that they viewed it as consistently and intellectually stimulating television,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. ""During CNN's tumbles in past years, they were falling behind reruns of ‘Golden Girls’ and ‘Peppa Pig,’ so it's probably best if MSNBC doesn't look at their ratings anytime soon if they want to stay anywhere close to their happy place,"" Houck added. ""Liberal viewers have to be emotionally, psychologically, and metaphorically distraught. They're beyond forlorn.""Houck doesn’t believe finger pointing and MSNBC hosts continuing to push far-left talking points will bring back progressive viewers anytime soon. ""The somber excuses blaming everyone from working-class women to Hispanic men to conservative media seem to be serving as only temporary balms to the scorching results. Chris Hayes and Alex Wagner have a brand to commit to where the only change the left will have to do is go even further left, so it's a stale product no one will want to listen to going forward,"" Houck said. MSNBC has seen viewers jump ship on the heels of news they didn’t like in the past. In 2019, Rachel Maddow’s viewership took a dive when Special Counsel Robert Mueller declared there was no collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia despite the far-left host spending years pushing the Russian collusion narrative. This time, Trump swept every battleground state after years of MSNBC hosts and pundits insisting that he was a threat to democracy. OutKick’s Bobby Burack feels that ""Trump's decisive victory demonstrated that the left-wing cable news networks have lost their influence.""""MSNBC exhausted every resource at their disposal to stop Donald Trump from achieving victory, eventually stooping to a plot to depict him as the second coming of Adolf Hitler, the most ruthless dictator in modern world history. It didn't work. The lies, the hysteria, and the besmirchment only made Trump more popular,"" Burack wrote. All data courtesy of Nielsen Media Research.

"Trump, powerhouse guests rock packed MSG with historic rally","Former President Trump took the stage at his historic Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday evening, where thousands of supporters from the deep-blue Northeast state cheered wildly as the 45th president railed against Biden-Harris administration policies and vowed to ""Make America great again."" Trump took the stage at Madison Square Garden just after 7 p.m. in the packed stadium, where he focused his speech on spiraling immigration, inflation woes and looking toward the future with lower consumer costs and securing the border. The rally was first-come, first-serve and sold out within hours of being announced this month. Madison Square Garden has a capacity of 19,500 people.""I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer,"" Trump told the crowds as he spoke about the illegal immigration crisis since 2021. ""I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail, going to kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible. And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs like MS-13, which is equally vicious, I will invoke the Alien Enemies act of 1798,"" he said. Trump said Harris was behind ""the most egregious betrayal"" of any U.S. leader due to immigration policies under the Biden-Harris administration. ""Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people. She has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border and unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens,"" he said. The 45th president said that if he's re-elected, he will also immediately ban sanctuary cities across the nation. The massive rally, where nearly 200,000 people tried to gain access, according to Donald Trump Jr., included a handful of high-profile speakers ahead of Trump's remarks, including an address from former first lady Melania Trump. ""Envision a wonderful America where the seeds of security, prosperity and health are so and once again for the benefit of our families,"" Melania Trump said before introducing her husband. ""Let us start together with a shared vision that builds on American greatness. Let's seize this moment and create a country for tomorrow, the future that we deserve. And now.""Other notable speakers at Trump's rally included House Speaker Mike Johnson, pro wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, tech billionaire Elon Musk, former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, and TV personality Dr. Phil McGraw. Trump's speech included a focus on the economy and spiraling inflation and ""bringing back the American dream,"" including vowing to the audience that he will cut their energy costs in half by January 2026 if he's elected.""I will terminate the ‘green new scam.’ And we'll cut your energy prices in half, 50%, within one year from Jan. 20th. Is the fake news hearing that?"" he said before directing the audience to the ""fake news media"" at the rally.Trump touted that if he wins the election next week, he will lower costs for consumers as well as end taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. ""We will rapidly defeat inflation, and we will very simply make America affordable again. We're going to make it affordable. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses, and we will have no tax on tips. No tax on overtime. And no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors,"" he said. Trump added that under his leadership, the Republican Party has become the ""party of inclusion.""""Jews and Muslims and Catholics and evangelicals and Mormons, and they're all joining our cause in large numbers, larger than anyone has ever seen in this country before, larger than they've ever seen in any country,"" he said.""And we're a big, powerful party, and they're losing it. They're really losing it. Together we will lift America to glory beyond your wildest dreams. It's going to happen fast, too.""Kennedy, who ran for president as a Democrat before endorsing Trump in August, railed against the Democratic Party for morphing into a party he no longer recognizes. ""The Democratic Party is the party of war. It's the party of the CIA. You had Kamala Harris giving a speech at the Democratic convention that was written by neocons. It was belligerent, pugnacious. It talked about domination of the world by the United States through our weapons of war. It's the party today that wants to divide Americans. It's a party that is dismantling women's sports by letting men play women's sports,"" he said. ""It's the party of Wall Street. It's the party of Bill Gates, who just gave $50 million to Harris. It's the party, and the Harris campaign is very proud that it received the endorsement of 50 former CIA agents and officers and of John Bolton and of Dick Cheney."" Musk wore his all-black MAGA hat during the rally, which he called ""dark gothic MAGA,"" and vowed to cut government spending if Trump secures the election and appoints Musk to the administration as ""Secretary of Cost-Cutting.""Trump had teased for months that he would hold a rally at Madison Square Garden and officially announced the event earlier in October. ""This is going to be an iconic, historic day, and you can see it's already full. I mean, it's amazing. These tickets sold out in less than three hours. And it shows the enthusiasm, the momentum, the energy as we are in this closing chapter of an unbelievable campaign,"" New York Rep. Elise Stefanik told Fox News Digital ahead of the rally, saying New York is in play for the Trump campaign. Fox News Digital spoke to attendees outside the arena, who said they are ""excited"" to see Trump at home in New York City and that many New Yorkers are ready to pull the lever for the GOP ticket next week. ""Absolutely,"" Westchester native Alexa Brink told Fox News Digital when asked if other New Yorkers she knows will vote for Trump. ""All day long; let's go Trump!"" She added that she wasn't sure if Trump could win New York, ""but we'll try!""Another rally-goer named Anas Shuaib said that on Nov. 5 voters will tell Harris: ""You're fired.""""I'm an Arab American, Muslim American, and I'm voting for Trump because just like Kamala kicked out that Muslim at the rally, Ahmed Ghanim, we're going to kick her out of the White House. And when Trump becomes president, there's going to be peace, there's going to be prosperity, and America first … no one else first,"" he said. Trump said during the rally that he will have the ""biggest victory in the history of our country in November.""""We're running against something far bigger than Joe or Kamala. And far more powerful than them, which is a massive, vicious, crooked, radical left machine that runs today's Democrat Party. They're just vessels. In fact, they're perfect vessels because they'll never give them a hard time. They'll do whatever they want. I know many of them. It's just this amorphous group of people. But they're smart, and they're vicious, and we have to defeat them,"" he said.""We're going to have the biggest victory in the history of our country on Nov. 5, and it's going to be the biggest victory in history.

Earlier Monday, Robert Clemente Jr., son of the Puerto Rican baseball legend, formally endorsed Trump in the city where his father played.

Trump supporters outside Madison Square Garden say 'exhilarating' rally shows NY is in play,"Ardent supporters of former President Trump say Sunday’s campaign rally at Madison Square Garden was a bold statement that their movement is penetrating deep blue areas like New York City.""Donald Trump is in play in every state,"" Pennsylvania resident John Nolan told Fox News Digital outside the famed arena ahead of the rally. ""The guy pulls numbers no matter where he is. I mean, people drove from all over to get here and his supporters are here."" ""Absolutely,"" Westchester, New York, native Alexa Brink told Fox Digital when asked if other New Yorkers she knows will vote for Trump. ""All day long. Let's go Trump!"" She added that she wasn't sure if Trump could win New York, but said, ""We'll try!""While New York is home to multiple competitive U.S. House races, Republicans are not widely expected to win the state in the presidential race. It has gone Democratic each presidential election since Ronald Reagan won it for the GOP in 1984.The mood outside the famed arena was at fever pitch as droves of supporters descended on the Big Apple's streets and waited anxiously to see if they would gain entry to the 19,500-seat venue. Police say many were turned away, with Donald Trump Jr. claiming that nearly 200,000 people tried to gain access to the rally, which featured a handful of high-profile speakers ahead of Trump's remarks, including former first lady Melania Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White.Melissa Elsner and Luke Ordino traveled from New Jersey and said they weren’t surprised at the size of the huge crowds that descended on ""The Worlds’ Most Famous Arena.""""No, absolutely not, because we are the majority, even though the news often tries to tell us we are not,"" Elsner said, adding that the economy, illegal immigration and education are her top three issues going into this election. ""Come on, Donald Trump can pull off anything in New York,"" Elsner added. One woman, Barabara Walsh, said she even traveled from Ireland to attend the much-anticipated event.A group of young Jewish supporters were in boisterous form in front of the stadium’s main entrance as they waited in line. ""USA, USA, USA,"" they chanted, jumping up and down and waving an Israeli flag. ""We’re here because we got to Make America Great Again, we need Trump back in the house to bring the hostages back… we need a good economy, no more wars… Kamala Harris keeps on flip-flopping,"" 17-year-old Tzvi Schoch said. ""Everybody was better… under Donald J. Trump than they are now, inflation is sky high, under Trump it was 1.9%. We need Trump back in office, we need the wall built, we need the illegal aliens that are taking our taxpayer money out of the country. We need a president that’s strong… and not be like Biden, like Harris. Sometimes peace comes through strength.""""Trump protects the Jews,"" yelled fellow 17-year-old Mendel Steigman, who said he and his friends have been victims of antisemitic attacks and insists Trump is a friend of Israel.Another animated rally-goer named Anas Shuaib, a Palestinian Muslim-American who has been living in America for 25 years, said that on Nov. 5 voters will tell Harris, ""You're fired, you’re fired, you’re fired.""""The Arabs are voting for Trump!"" Shuaib said. ""When Trump becomes president, there's going to be peace, there's going to be prosperity and America first!

""I think the symbolism of it is just fantastic because New York City is a blue city and him coming in and having such a turnout, I mean it was packed, it was filled and there were thousands outside. I think a lot of the blue cities are becoming more and more red because at a certain point the extremism of the Democrats – the defund the police, the transgender[ism] – all of the issues just push normal common sensical people to the right.""Gottlieb said she was once a ""left-wing person,"" but many years of studying issues like racial and sexual politics moved her to the right. Edward X. Young said he has been to 102 Trump rallies and Sunday’s was very important because Trump was loved by nearly everyone in the city before he got into politics, but the deep blue city turned against him.  Young, who lived in the Big Apple from 1983 to 1990 and now resides in New Jersey, said the rally showed that New Yorkers are back in the former president’s corner. ""Trump was New York City’s favorite son, he was beloved. In the last election cycle, there was not even a rally in the city… but he came back big time,"" said Young, who said he met his fiancé at a Trump rally. ""Four or five years ago if I wore MAGA gear around the Bronx I‘d get my butt kicked, but no, the local people love him and it's obvious why… it’s because the Democrats, they went too far,"" Young said, noting that it has become harder for working-class people in the city to survive. J Mellz, a musician from New York City who has lived in Brooklyn and Queens, said Trump is making big gains among Blacks, Latinos and other minorities. ""I feel it was enthusiastic, I feel it was something that New York needed, I feel it is something that the media is not going to show to the full extent, but it shows how united New York is,"" Mellz said.

Tulsi Gabbard on short list of candidates for director of national intelligence job,"President-elect Trump will soon choose his nominee to lead the nation’s intelligence community and is believed to be considering a former Democrat. Tulsi Gabbard, a former Hawaii House Democrat, is on a shortlist of contenders for director of national intelligence, multiple sources have confirmed to Fox News Digital.Former Utah Republican House Rep. Chris Stewart is also in ""active discussions"" with the transition team about the role, a source said. Stewart resigned from the House in 2023 to be with his wife when she had health issues. He co-founded lobbying firm Skyline Capitol with Trump's former national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, who was also rumored to be considered for an administration job. Gabbard, a veteran and active duty Army reservist, served in the House as a Democrat from 2013 to 2021, before joining the Republican Party and campaigning for Trump in his most recent race for president. She is now a co-chair of the Trump transition team.n September, Gabbard told Fox News Digital she would be ""honored"" to join a Trump administration and added that bringing an end ""to the influence of the military industrial complex,"" working to prevent World War III and bringing the U.S. back ""from the brink of nuclear war"" would be among her priorities.She was reportedly interested in the defense secretary job, but Trump is reported to have promised that appointment to former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, also an Army veteran.Gabbard has criticized Democrats as ""pro-censorship"" and ""anti-freedom,"" but her criticisms have extended to Republicans, as well. She has spoken out against U.S. involvement in the Middle East and criticized Trump during his first administration for the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Gabbard controversially met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017 during the country’s civil war. She was opposed to the U.S. arming Syrian rebel groups and said she was ""ready to meet with anyone if there's a chance it can help bring about an end to this war.""Gabbard was reportedly placed on a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) watchlist for terrorists known as ""Quiet Skies"" earlier this year. The program allows federal air marshals to follow U.S. citizens and collect information on their behavior in an effort to stop threats ""posed by unknown or partially known terrorists."" ""As I was traveling, I ended up in 30 to 45 minutes of going through screening every time I would go to the airport to fly,"" she told Fox’s One Nation. ""I noticed air marshals, I noticed K-9 teams. There were things that I saw and noticed that were highly unusual. But the deepest pain and harm and stress that’s been caused by this is that, forever going forward, I will always be looking over my shoulder, wondering if and how my government is surveilling me."" In Congress, she co-sponsored legislation that would ban first-use of nuclear weapons and often decries politicians who ""beat the drums of war and ratchet up tensions.""Gabbard, who is a Fox News contributor, could not be reached for comment. Trump, on Tuesday, tapped John Ratcliffe, his former director of national intelligence, to lead the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The director of national intelligence leads an office that advises the president, National Security Council and Homeland Security Council on national security matters.

"Trump likely to make several border security moves on first day, says expert","Voters chose to send President-elect Trump back to the White House in large part over concerns about immigration and border security, something the former president will look to quickly address when he starts a new term in office.""He could probably shut down the border, declare that there’s an emergency… stop the entry of people until further notice,"" Alfonso Aguilar, a former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship and the Director of Hispanic Engagement at the American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. ""That I think in some shape or form, will be one of his first actions.""The comments come as Trump will now shift his focus from the campaign to his return to the White House, where immigration and border security promise to be top concerns for the incoming administration.Trump spent much of the campaign promising to secure the border and deport those in the country illegally, drawing a sharp contrast between himself and the Biden administration, which saw record-setting numbers of border crossings over its first three years in the White House.Voters rewarded Trump for the messaging, with 75% of voters indicating that border security was an important factor to them in the most recent election, 61% of whom supported Trump, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis.Trump will look to make good on that trust on Day 1 of his new administration, Aguilar said, when shutting down the border could just be one of several announced changes.Another way Trump could act on Day 1 is to announce expedited procedures for removing immigrants who are in the country illegally, most notably immigrants who have committed crimes.""If you identify people who have criminal records, who have committed a crime, you have somehow find a way to expedite their removal,"" Aguilar said. ""I would imagine that they have in place an expedited procedure to remove those individuals involved in crime.""Other policies that could see swift changing include an end to the CHNV parole program, which has allowed migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to apply for Advance Travel Authorizations into the U.S. and then be paroled into the country with a court date, with many being eligible to apply for work authorization once in the country.""They can end that on Day 1,"" Aguilar said.Catch-and-release tactics are also likely to end quickly under Trump, Aguilar noted.Aguilar also said there could be a return of ""workforce raids,"" an enforcement tactic not seen in recent years that might be back in the ""first few days, few weeks.""Other policies, however, are likely to take time, including a return to the Migrant Protection Protocols, more commonly referred to as ""Remain in Mexico,"" which will require coordination with the Mexican government.Some improvements may also require legislation, including obtaining more funding to finish the border wall and hire more immigration judges and other border security personnel.""There’s certain things that he will be able to do administratively, but he may need some legislation for some of the other stuff,"" Aguilar said. ""If you want to hire more immigration judges, you’re going to need more money, so I would imagine that they will also have some sort of immigration package ready to go to get money from Congress.""",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-likely-make-several-border-security-moves-first-day-says-expert
"In election victory, Trump's gains went beyond the battlegrounds","President-elect Trump flipped six highly competitive states in his election victory last week — but his gains with voters were not limited to the battlegrounds.Trump improved his vote share across the country, starting with conservative areas but extending into deeply Democratic states.It is a critical part of the story of this election: one where Trump built a broader coalition and led on two defining issues of the campaign.Trump gained in the battlegrounds and beyond, including traditionally Democratic areasTrump gained in all seven of the battleground states. He gained 1.8 points in Michigan and Pennsylvania, 1.4 points in Georgia, just over a point in North Carolina, and under a point in Wisconsin.(Trump’s largest gains are currently in Nevada and Arizona, two of 10 states where there is significant vote left to count.)But Trump’s best performances relative to 2020 were in reliably Democratic states. These states voted for Democrats, but by narrower margins than before.His strongest improvement was in New York, where the former and future president gained 6.4 points. His county-level gains were spread across the state, but notably included an improvement in all five of the New York City boroughs (where, again, there are some votes left to be counted).He also posted a 5-point improvement in neighboring New Jersey, enough to reduce the margin of his loss to just 5.5 points. That is the best performance for a Republican candidate in more than three decades.Look for New Jersey and Virginia (Trump +2.4 since 2020) to become a focal point in future elections, beginning with next year’s gubernatorial races.Trump also took more vote share in Illinois (Trump +4.2 since 2020), another Democratic state with a highly populated urban area.And as some pre-election polls predicted, the president-elect brought home another 5 points' worth of votes in Florida, where Democrats fought hard for a victory just two cycles ago.Just as he improved in the battlegrounds and left-leaning states, he also put up strong gains in states like Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina and Idaho. Trump posted a 3-point improvement in all four of those conservative states, with smaller improvements in over a dozen more.In fact, as of this writing, there isn’t a single state in the country where Trump turned in a weaker performance than he did four years ago.Harris’ gains limited to a handful of disparate areasSo far, Harris has only outperformed President Biden’s vote share in one state: Utah, where she gained 0.6 points since the last election.But even in Utah, Trump also performed about a point better than he did in 2020. It is third-party candidates who saw the most erosion. (And there are many ballots left to count.)To find positives for Harris, you have to search for a smattering of counties across the nation.The vice president did 2 to 9 points better in a few counties in the Georgia metropolitan area, led by Henry, Rockdale and Douglas.She also improved in some of the North Carolina counties most impacted by Hurricane Helene, particularly Democratic-leaning Buncombe, but also Henderson and Transylvania. She posted about a 4-point gain in each.Kaufman County, in the Dallas suburbs, also bucked the national trend. That Texas county swung about 6 points towards Harris.Harris posted a modest gain in Chaffee County, Colorado, otherwise known as the ""Heart of the Rockies"" (here, too, there are some outstanding ballots).And there are signs that parts of Oregon and Washington could end up more Democratic than 2020 when counting is finished.These are the exceptions to a clear rule: voters almost uniformly swung away from the Democrats this cycle.Trump created a broader coalition and led on the top two issuesThe Fox News Voter Analysis shows that Trump’s gains came from multiple groups, and that voters preferred him on two defining issues.Trump’s victory was powered by his strength on the economy and immigration — two of voters’ top concerns. He was seen as a stronger leader than Harris in a time of turmoil, and voters remembered his presidency more fondly than their evaluations of the current administration. Trump ran up the score with his base while narrowing traditional Democratic advantages among Black, Hispanic and young voters.",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/election-victory-trumps-gains-went-beyond-battlegrounds
What happens to the Gaetz House ethics report?,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., resigned from Congress late Wednesday, hours after President-elect Trump nominated him for U.S. Attorney General – and days before a long-awaited House Ethics report was reportedly to be released about him. Earlier Wednesday, after news broke that Gaetz was chosen for the Trump Cabinet, House Ethics Committee Chair Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., told reporters that their investigation, which had reportedly centered around allegations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct with a minor and illicit drug use, would end if Gaetz were to step down from Congress. Gaetz has denied those misconduct allegations.  ""This changes nothing,"" Guest said in the Capitol, referring to Gaetz’ nomination. ""I've been asked, ‘Does this call us to expedite our investigation?’ Once the investigation is complete, then a report will be issued,"" Guest said. ""Assuming that at that time, that Mr. Gaetz is still a member of Congress. If Mr. Gaetz were to resign because he is taking a position, with the administration, as the attorney general, then the Ethics Committee loses jurisdiction at that point. Once we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued – that's not unique to this case."" Guest said the Justice Department had previously requested the committee ""cease and desist"" its probe, which the House had since picked back up and was continuing. The committee was slated to vote on whether to release the ethics report as soon as Friday, Punchbowl News first reported. Citing a Republican source, the New York Times reported that the report had been delayed because of a House rule that prevents releasing negative findings so close to an election. Gaetz was the architect behind the ouster of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and dozens of Republican lawmakers tipped off about his resignation before it was formally announced Wednesday night were glad to see him go, Politico reported. A House Republican told Politico on condition of anonymity that Gaetz was stepping down from Congress to ""stymie the ethics investigation that is coming out in one week."" But House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., offered a different explanation. At a press conference later Wednesday, Johnson said Gaetz told him he resigned abruptly to expedite the process of filling his House seat through a special election. Republicans held onto the House after last week’s election, cementing unified power across Congress and the White House, but there has been some concern over the margin, as Trump plucks House Republicans to join his new administration. Johnson said he was optimistic about finding Gaetz’ replacement before the House chooses a new speaker on Jan. 3, but it is unclear if state and federal law can accommodate the tight timeline. ""He issued his resignation letter, effective immediately, of Congress. That caught us by surprise a little bit,"" Johnson told reporters. ""But I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, ‘Well, you can't have too many absences.’ So under Florida state law, there's about an eight-week period to select and fill in a vacancy. And so by doing so today, that allows me – I've already placed a call to Governor DeSantis in Florida and said, ‘Let's start the clock.’ He's in Italy at the moment. And so we're going to talk first thing in the morning."" ""And if we start the clock now, if you do the math, we may be able to fill that seat as early as Jan. 3 when we take the new oath of office for the new Congress,"" Johnson said. ""So, Matt would have done us a great service, by making that decision, as he did on the fly. And so we're grateful for that."" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters earlier Wednesday that Trump’s decision to nominate Gaetz as attorney general ""is a strong statement that the weaponization of government, you know, in the Biden administration using government against their political enemies as coming to an end, that party's over, and we're going to clean up the mess over at the Department of Justice."" Politico reported, however, that several Republican senators were doubting Gaetz would be confirmed to the attorney general position, and those doubts appeared to carry over into the House. ""When it comes to all of his selections, I think all of them have been made with a lot of intent and respect and integrity – when it comes to the selection of Rep. Gaetz, I just think it's silly. I believe that the president is probably rewarding him for being such a loyal soldier,"" Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, told reporters. ""But the president is smart enough, and his team is smart enough to know that Mr. Gaetz will never get confirmed by the Senate whatsoever. And so this is just going to be a very long period of time for him, that he's going to get excoriated by members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle, because he's never been a team player and he's never helped out this conference.""

Fox News Poll: Trump still narrowly ahead of Harris in North Carolina,"North Carolina likely voters put former President Trump ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest, according to a new Fox News survey. That’s unchanged since September.Trump is ahead by 49%-47% among likely voters, while third-party candidates receive 4%. In the two-way contest, his edge narrows to 1 point — a useful indicator as pre-election surveys often overstate support for third-party candidates. Among the larger universe of registered voters, Harris is up by 1 point on both the expanded ballot (48%-47%) and head-to-head (50%-49%).The differences between Harris and Trump on all ballot tests fall within the margin of error. The previous Fox News survey of North Carolina voters, released in September, also had Trump favored by just a touch among likely voters and Harris narrowly up among registered voters.Looking at results on the full ballot among likely voters, Trump is favored among Whites without a college degree, White voters overall, rural voters and voters ages 65 and over. Harris is preferred among Black voters, urban voters, voters with a college degree and those under age 35. She also has a small edge among suburban voters, driven by her wider margin among suburban women than Trump’s lead among suburban men.  Trump is meeting or exceeding his 2020 numbers among these groups, while Harris’ support trails what President Biden received among Blacks, young voters and suburban voters, according to the North Carolina Fox News Voter Analysis election survey.There is a 20-point gender gap, as men back Trump by 13 points and women go for Harris by 7.The former president is helped by North Carolina having more of the kinds of voters who make up his base. More identify as Republican than Democrat, fewer have college degrees and there are far more rural than urban voters.Trump has won the Tar Heel state twice, in 2016 by nearly 4 percentage points and in 2020 by just over 1 point. In the last 20 years, former President Obama was the only Democrat to win North Carolina, and that was by less than half a point in 2008.""Whoever wins North Carolina will likely do two things, win the suburbs with a stronger closing message and maximize turnout in their base areas,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. When likely voters are asked who they trust to handle top issues, they favor Trump on immigration (by 17 points), the conflict in the Middle East (+10), and the economy (+6). Harris is preferred to handle election integrity (+4) and abortion (+12). Some 14% of Harris supporters trust Trump on handling immigration, while 11% of those backing Trump trust Harris on abortion.  By a 5-point margin, more voters see Trump as a strong leader, while more say Harris has the right temperament to be president by 5 points. There are smaller differences on helping the middle class (Harris +3), protecting American democracy (Harris +3), fighting for people like you (Harris +1), bringing needed change (Trump +2) and saying what they believe rather than what will get them elected (Trump +3). More Trump backers (75%) than Harris backers (71%) say they are extremely interested in the election, while over 9 in 10 of each candidate's backers say they are certain of their vote choice.  By a 4-point margin, more voters view both Harris and Trump negatively than positively, 48% favorable vs. 52% unfavorable for each. By comparison, President Biden’s personal rating is underwater by 13 points (43%-56%).  Harris is up by 2 points among the 4 in 10 who say they have already voted (50%-48%). Overall, voters who say they will cast their ballot early favor Trump by 1 point, while he is favored among those planning to vote on Election Day by 7 points.In the governor’s race, Democrat Josh Stein leads Republican Mark Robinson by 16 points, 57%-41%. Support for Stein overperforms support for Harris because 14% of those backing him also favor Trump in the presidential race. ""Despite carrying a troubled gubernatorial candidate and having to mobilize voters in areas devastated by the hurricane, Trump continues to run slightly ahead by generating enthusiastic support among key Republican constituencies,"" notes Shaw.Poll-pourriAmong the larger sample of registered voters …— Harris gets a touch more support among Democrats (95%) than Trump receives from Republicans (93%), as well as narrowly capturing independents (46% vs. Trump’s 41%, within the margin of error). — While Trump enjoys the backing of 76% of non-MAGA Republicans, Harris gets 17%, with another 5% favoring a third-party candidate (there are too few to breakout among the likely voter subsample). — Trump’s advantage has narrowed to just 3 percentage points on handling the economy, down from a 7-point lead last month and a 9-point lead in August.  — Equal numbers of voters say they are holding steady financially as say they are falling behind (44% each), while only 1 in 10 feel their family is getting ahead. Those numbers are unchanged since February, despite major flooding and damage from Hurricane Helene in September.

"'Too little, too late': Former rap mogul reveals why he's endorsing Trump in scathing rebuke of Biden-Harris","The co-founder of Death Row Records, one of the most recognizable and influential record labels in the music industry, spoke to Fox News Digital about why he recently decided to endorse former President Trump over VP Kamala Harris.""It's about his track record,"" Michael ""Harry-O"" Harris told Fox News Digital about his decision to endorse Trump, who granted Harris clemency from a 33-year prison sentence that had seven years remaining on it as one of his last actions as president. ""The former president, while president, enacted some initiatives that speaks to my community specifically and other people as well.""Harris cited several examples of policies from the first Trump administration that he feels are in line with the goals of his organization, Community First Action, including permanent funding for HBCUs, opportunity zones promoting investment in low income neighborhoods, the First Step Act, and bipartisan legislation combating sickle cell anemia.Polls have increasingly shown that Trump has made significant inroads with the Black community and is expected by many to earn a historically strong share of those votes in November. Harris told Fox News Digital he believes it is due in part to voters trusting that Trump will keep his word, and a lack of movement from the Biden-Harris administration. ""People have more confidence that he will keep his word and I think it's kind of based on some of the same research that we did, that when somebody doesn't campaign on something but actually enacted laws . . . that wants to double down on what he did in the first administration,"" Harris said. ""I haven't heard that from the other side as much. I mean, what I've heard, I believe, frankly, came a little bit too late, too little, too late. And so, when it comes to a balancing act, and you have to make a decision, the critical decision that could affect your life and the life of your family, you have to go based on facts, and the facts are that for the last three and a half years, the previous, the present administration hasn't really focused on our community.""Harris told Fox News Digital that ""there’s nothing to refer to of substance"" that the Biden-Harris administration has done to ""help elevate our community.""""But even with that said, I still put the challenge out to both candidates and President Trump tapped in and that support meant a lot to our organization but more importantly to our community that somebody is committing to working with us to deal with real issues in the community.""Fox News Digital asked Harris what his theory is as to why VP Harris has struggled to earn the support of Black voters the way that President Biden did, according to polling.""I think that, people at large, I just want to be honest here. Don't understand the intelligence of the black community,"" Harris responded. ""I think that they put them in a box and just think that everybody suffers from the herd mentality, that just because certain parts of our community say we should do this, then everybody should do it.""""I'm not saying that some people don't fall into that bracket, but a lot of people go back to reality. They have to go back to reality, because they are living in reality that their groceries is triple or double the gas is double or triple that just to be able to rent or pay their mortgage is double. Things have changed for them in a dramatic way in the last four years.""Harris continued, ""So when somebody starts saying vote for me just because is insulting, and I think that that's what the fallback is that somebody is going to vote for you for a double up of what they just had. I think people are too intelligent for that.""Harris also spoke about his ""life-changing"" experience of being pardoned by Trump after spending decades in prison on drug trafficking charges. ""I'd been gone for 33 years and President Trump decided to make a difference and what some people don't know, I had put in a request for clemency twice under President Obama's administration and never heard anything back and the fact that President Trump on his way out was able to provide that relief to me and others, I can't even put words around it,"" Harris said. ""It changed everything for me. It changed everything for my family. It gave me an opportunity to re-engage in society and try to do my part. To make it a better place.""Harris explained that he had met with Trump for about an hour after being released from prison and shed some light on what that conversation looked like.""We just sat and talked about issues and about family, and I remember me asking him, you know, because I'm so grateful, you know? What can I do for you? He said you don't owe me nothing, the only thing you owe me to be honest with you is to be successful,"" Harris said. ""I read your file. I saw what you had done while you was away, and it was commendable, and I just didn't think that you should do another day in prison.""Earlier this month, Harris released the ""O-Plan"" as a ""challenge for anyone seeking to be President of the United States of America to commit to the following policy proposals to end fleeting promises of hope and change.""Those proposals include promoting economic self-sufficiency to end the vicious cycle of generational debt, incentivizing responsible homeownership through the expansion of ""rent to own"" programs, and developing a comprehensive and targeted economic empowerment program that fosters financial literacy, career development, and entrepreneurship education.Shortly after that announcement, Trump posted on Truth Social: ""Michael Harris (Harry O) is working hard to support and build on what my administration did for Black Americans in the first term. Good luck to Michael and the Community First team.

Speaker Mike Johnson reveals Trump's 'little secret' ahead of Election Day after Dems panic,"House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday told voters in Pennsylvania that the ""little secret"" former President Trump mentioned at his Madison Square Garden rally is a get-out-the-vote strategy, not something ""diabolical."" Democrats have been in panic since Trump teased Sunday that his ""little secret"" with Johnson would help Republicans keep the House of Representatives come Election Day. A New York Times article suggested that in the worst case scenario, Democrats feared Johnson would work with Trump to steal the election and stop the certification of results on Jan. 6. 2025, should Vice President Harris win.""It’s nothing scandalous, but we’re having a ball with this. The media, their heads are exploding. ‘What is the secret?’"" Johnson said Monday at an event for GOP congressional candidate Ryan Mackenzie, according to The Hill. ""It’s a thing we have about — it’s a get-out-the-vote. It’s one of our tactics on get-out-the-vote,"" Johnson said in response to a voter's question about Trump's comment.""But they are convinced,"" the speaker added, jokingly rubbing his hands together like he had an evil plan. On Sunday, Trump said his ""little secret"" with Johnson would help Republicans win congressional elections, but he otherwise kept tight-lipped about it. ""I think with our little secret we’re going to do really well with the House, right?"" Trump said, directing his remarks at Johnson. ""Our little secret is having a big impact. He and I have a little secret — we will tell you what it is when the race is over.""His comments, delivered with a chuckle, set off a reported wave of fear and panic among Democrats who speculated that Trump could have been referring to attempts to steal the election.Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., told the Times he took Trump to mean he had a ""backup plan"" in case Republicans lose the election.""There’s a lot of ability for a bad actor to mess with the Electoral College if he’s the speaker of the House,"" he said. ""If I’m wrong, they should say so. Trump has a lot of secrets: His medical records are secret, his taxes are secret, his phone calls with Vladimir Putin are secret. Clearly he hides a lot from the American people. Now he’s openly stated that he’s hiding something from the electorate.""In comments to The Hill, Johnson called the rampant speculation that he and Trump were planning to break the law after the election ""absolute, utter nonsense."" ""I’m a lifelong constitutional law attorney. We’re going to respect the law. We’re going to follow the constitution to a T,"" Johnson told the outlet. ""I’ve proven that over and over and over. So all this conjecture is actually hilarious to us, that people are apoplectic about this. It’s a — it’s one of our get out the vote strategies. That’s what we’re talking about. And it’s almost a tongue-in-cheek thing.""Reached for comment, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""President Trump has done countless telerallies reaching millions of Americans across the country in key regions that also helps bolster Republicans in congressional races."" In Pennsylvania, Johnson said Trump refers to this get-out-the-vote effort as their ""secret."" ""It’s not diabolical,"" he said, per The Hill. ""It’s actually very good. It’s going to help us with the turnout. All this is blowing their minds. They just can’t — They cannot fathom that Trump and Vance have the support that they do around the country like they do from — from new demographics of people.""",29-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/speaker-mike-johnson-reveals-trumps-little-secret-ahead-election-day-after-dems-panic
Trump stop in blue-leaning state could boost Republican bid to flip Democrat-held Senate seat,"The Republican Senate nominee in New Mexico says former President Trump's stop in the blue-leaning southwestern state on Thursday ""will infuse our state with a lot of momentum.""Nella Domenici, the 2024 GOP Senate nominee and the daughter of New Mexico's last Republican senator, is trying to defeat Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich, who is running in November for a third six-year term, as her party works to win back the chamber's majority.""Trump is definitely going to help us with the independents,"" Domenici predicted in a Fox News Digital interview on the eve of the former president's visit to the state. With five days until Election Day next Tuesday, the former president is making a rare detour from campaigning in the seven crucial battleground states in the White House race that will likely determine if Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris wins the 2024 election.It's been two decades since a Republican carried New Mexico in a presidential election. You've got to go back to President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election.There hasn't been an abundance of polling in New Mexico, but most recent surveys indicate Harris with an upper single digit lead over Trump, although one survey suggests a tighter contest for the state's five electoral votes.With time such a precious commodity for presidential campaigns and the clock quickly ticking toward Election Day, New Mexico Democrats say Trump's trip to the state - his first in five years - is a fool's errand.""Trump is wasting his time coming to our state as polling shows New Mexicans are set to reject his MAGA extremism and divisive rhetoric yet again,"" Democratic Party of New Mexico spokesperson Daniel Garcia claimed in a statement.And referring to the Oct. 31st stop in Albuquerque by the former president, Garcia took a verbal shot at Trump, saying ""a rotund orange mass will be in Albuquerque on Halloween, and we’re not talking about a pumpkin.""But Domenici, who's trying to narrow the gap with Heinrich, sees down-ballot benefits to Trump's stop at the airport in Albuquerque, the state's largest city.""People are really excited to have Trump come here,"" she told Fox News. ""It definitely excites the base hugely and the base is kind of a growing term.""Domenici argued that ""we have so many problems in our state that finally people are saying ‘I give up on the Democrats and I want to be a Republican’ and it’s happening every day, every week, of this race.""A lot of Hispanic Democrats are coming over to our side. They’re mad that the cost of living is so high. They’re mad that crime is everywhere. You can’t even go get gas in your car at night,"" Domenici claimed. ""There’s a lot of momentum for people to want to vote Republican.""Domenici has decades of experience in the finance industry at Bridgewater Associates (where she served as chief financial officer), Credit Suisse and Citadel Investment group.She's also the daughter of the late longtime Republican Sen. Pete Domenici, who served for 36 years in the Senate before retiring at the beginning of 2009 at the end of his sixth term.The legacy of her father, who died in 2017, gives the younger Domenici a powerful political brand and plenty of name recognition in New Mexico.""My family’s name has absolutely helped me a huge amount. It’s because my father’s legacy is so deeply appreciated here by multiple generations,"" she emphasized.

The press secretary role is one of the most visible at the White House, typically holding daily press briefings with the White House press corps to speak on behalf of the president.Trump's new administration plans to challenge longstanding traditions that favor mainstream outlets like major broadcast and cable news networks, national newspapers and wire services, like The Associated Press, in the James Brady Press Briefing Room, according to Axios.Trump's new administration is considering giving MAGA-friendly outlets access to the press briefings, Axios reports, which have traditionally featured cable news, print and wire service reporters.Trump continues making his cabinet picks ahead of his inauguration as the 47th president of the U.S. in January.Some congressional Republicans told Fox News Digital Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who resigned from Congress on Wednesday as Trump tapped him to be his attorney general, may face a tough confirmation path because he was previously under Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into sex trafficking allegations. Last year, Gaetz's office said the DOJ ended their investigation and determined he would not be charged with any crimes. A House Ethics Committee investigation into Gaetz was also expected to be released soon, but Gaetz's resignation means it may not become public.Tulsi Gabbard, who served as a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii from 2013 to 2021 before becoming an independent in 2022 and joining the GOP last month, has been selected by Trump to serve as director of national intelligence in his new Cabinet.

"Trump names Stephen Miller, Dan Scavino to senior White House staff","Trump 2024 campaign senior advisers Dan Scavino and Stephen Miller are among four new White House staff picks announced by the Trump-Vance transition team on Wednesday as the president-elect continues to fill up his incoming administration at breakneck speed.Scavino will return to the White House as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff. He was the director of social media for the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and has worked alongside the president-elect ever since, including serving as the White House’s director of social media in Trump’s first term in office. Scavino ""remains one of President Trump's longest serving and most trusted aides,"" a statement released by the Trump-Vance transition team.Scavino was also held in contempt of Congress in 2022 after a month-long refusal to comply with a subpoena from the House committee’s investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He claimed executive privilege and the Department of Justice refused to prosecute him.Miller has been named as the deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security adviser. Miller previously served in the Trump White House as senior adviser to the president for policy, where he helped craft many of Trump’s hard-line speeches and plans on immigration. Since Trump left office, Miller has served as the president of America First Legal, an organization of former Trump advisers fashioned as a conservative version of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the Biden administration, media companies, universities and others over issues such as freedom of speech, religious freedom, and national security.Miller has advocated for mass deportations during a second Trump term, during which he will serve as an assistant to the president.The announcement came shortly before President-elect Trump met with President Biden at the White House.Meanwhile, James Blair will be the president's deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs. Blair was the political director for both the Trump 2024 campaign and the Republican National Committee, managing hundreds of staff and overseeing a wide portfolio of political operations and programs, per the statement.Blair was key to Trump’s economic messaging during his winning White House comeback campaign this year, a driving force behind the candidate’s ""Trump can fix it"" slogan and his query to audiences this fall if they were better off than four years ago.Taylor Budowich will serve as the president-elect’s deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel. Prior to joining the Trump 2024 campaign, Budowich served in a senior role in the Save America, Trump’s leadership political action committee (PAC) , and as CEO of the pro-Trump Super PAC, MAGA Inc.Like Scavino and Miller, Blair and Budowich will also serve as assistants to the president-elect.""Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were 'best in class' advisers on my winning campaign and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,"" President-elect Trump said via the statement.

Puerto Rico Shadow Senator endorses Trump at PA rally after 'Kill Tony' controversy at MSG,"One of Puerto Rico's two ""shadow senators"" endorsed former President Trump only days after comic ""Kill Tony"" Hinchcliffe delivered a widely criticized set demeaning the island protectorate at the Republican's New York City rally.Shadow Sen. Zoraida Buxo, a Republican, said she was proud to be back in Allentown, Pennsylvania's third-largest city, and the anchor of a key swing congressional district. Shadow Senators are elected officials who are not seated in the upper chamber, but are tasked with advocating for their territory and its statehood.In a recent Fox News Digital interview, Allentown Democratic Mayor Matt Tuerk said that for the first time, the city – settled by English loyalist William Allen and historically Pennsylvania Dutch – is Latino-majority. Only Hazleton and Reading reportedly have a higher proportion as of 2022. Allentown's population is estimated at 126,000, and about one-quarter is Puerto Rican.Buxo nodded to that development in her speech, about two hours prior to Trump's estimated speaking time. The president had been delayed leaving another event in Delaware County earlier in the day.Buxo said she is reminded of her home island's ""steadfast conservative values of community, family, faith and deep love of country.""""That is home. That is Puerto Rico,"" she said.Without mentioning Hinchcliffe by name in her address, she appeared to reference the controversy, saying ""we won't get rattled, we won't yield to ignorance [or] foolishness… we will remain focused on what is very important.""""We all share a desire of change for the good,"" she later added.Buxo slammed the ""failed policies"" of the Biden-Harris administration, touching on border security, law enforcement and the economy.She said there are nearly six million Puerto Ricans living stateside, and that about 500,000 reside in Pennsylvania.""We Hispanics are part of the soul of this country. We have made a difference, and we will again make a difference in this coming election to bring about much-needed change,"" she said.""I urge you to watch out and stay focused on what is truly important when you go to cast your vote … We need change and Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are not the option to bring about the kind of change that you need and want.""She closed her remarks with the endorsement:""We need the leadership of Donald J. Trump as our Commander-in-Chief and Dave McCormick for a renewed leadership in the United States Senate,"" she said.""Pennsylvanians – Americans, all – a better future is in your hands – your vote is the most powerful tool you have to bring about change. And for Latinos: Dale a Trump la fuersa de ta voto (""Give Trump the force of your vote"").""And for those reasons, I strongly and fully support and endorse Donald J. Trump to be our 47th president to Make America Great Again and to Make Puerto Rico Shine Again.""Meanwhile, outside the rally – held at the PPL Center hockey arena and entertainment venue home to the Flyers affiliate Lehigh Valley Phantoms -- a billboard reportedly displayed the Washington Post's headline following Trump's Madison Square Garden Event.Flipping between Spanish and English, according to the New York Times, the type read ""Trump rally speakers lob racist insults, call Puerto Rico ‘island of garbage.""Conversely, the prayer to kick off the event was recited by Roberto Albino, who called himself a ""proud Puerto Rican"" and complimented Trump.",29-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/puerto-rico-shadow-senator-endorses-trump-pa-rally-after-kill-tony-controversy-msg
Chinese hackers attempted to breach Trump and Harris campaigns' cellphone data,"The U.S. government is investigating unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by Chinese hackers, targets of which include the Trump and Harris campaigns. The campaigns have been informed of the potential breach of cellphones used by former President Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, and members of Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter.""After the FBI identified specific malicious activity targeting the sector, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims,"" the FBI and CISA told Fox News Digital in a joint statement. The FBI and CISA said the investigation was ongoing and ""we encourage any organization that believes it might be a victim to engage its local FBI field office or CISA. Agencies across the U.S. Government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector.""The hackers are believed to be connected to the Chinese government's intelligence services, The Journal reported. ""We are aware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several U.S. telecommunications providers to gather intelligence,"" telecommunications company Verizon said in a statement. ""Along with federal law enforcement, industry peers and third-party cyber experts, we are working to confirm, assess and remediate any potential impact. Verizon is committed to assisting law enforcement in this investigation.  Since this is an active investigation, we have no additional comment at this time.""The anonymous officials said that investigators are working to find out if any data was stolen from the campaigns, adding that other people in the U.S. government may have been targeted by the attackers. The Trump campaign blamed the Biden-Harris administration over the attack. ""This is the continuation of election interference by Kamala Harris and Democrats who will stop at nothing, including emboldening China and Iran attacking critical American infrastructure, to prevent President Trump from returning to the White House,"" Steven Cheung, communications director for the Trump campaign, told Fox News Digital on Friday. A person familiar with the matter also confirmed to Fox News Digital that the Harris campaign was also targeted.The latest apparent attack comes months after the Trump campaign said campaign data was targeted by hackers from Iran. In September, three hackers linked to Iran were indicted in connection with a hacking plot against the Trump campaign. The three hackers, who are accused of working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, were allegedly ""engaged in a wide-ranging hacking campaign that used spear-phishing and social engineering techniques to target and compromise the accounts of current and former U.S. government officials, members of the media, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals associated with U.S. political campaigns.""""These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,"" Cheung said in August after Politico reported that the campaign had been targeted through spear phishing. Fox News Digital has also reached out to the Harris campaign for comment. It's not the first election cycle a foreign power has attempted to influence the election via hacking.In 2016, the Democratic candidate for president, Hillary Clinton, and the DNC infamously had their emails hacked by Russia and released through Wikileaks during the election.

AOC chimes in after JD Vance refers to Kamala Harris as 'trash',"Sen. JD Vance, former President Trump's 2024 running mate, referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as ""trash"" during a speech on the eve of Election Day.""The citizens of this country are not garbage for wanting to be able to afford groceries and a nice place to live. But in two days we are gonna take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trash's name is Kamala Harris,"" Vance declared.In a post on X, Rep.

Where does Trump's New York sentencing stand after massive election win?,"Following his massive election victory, President-elect Trump is still scheduled for sentencing in his Manhattan criminal case later this month, with presiding Judge Juan Merchan first ruling whether to dismiss the charges altogether after the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling earlier this year. Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records following his Manhattan criminal trial in May. District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office worked to prove that Trump falsified the business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to former porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to quiet her claims of an alleged affair with Trump in 2006. Trump has maintained his innocence in the case. Trump is scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 26, which is already a four-month delay from the original date of July 11. Trump's lawyers had asked Merchan to overturn the former president’s guilty verdict in New York v. Trump after the Supreme Court ruled in July that former presidents have substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts in office, but not for unofficial acts. Merchan is expected to rule by Nov. 12 as to where the charges stand.""A normal judge would dismiss this case, and then the DA would have to decide, what — if anything – remains, so that we could consider re-bringing the case. But Judge Merchan has shown himself to be nothing but an ordinary judge. And so the catch-22 here is, if he was normal, he would dismiss it, but because he's not normal, he'll probably deny it. But because it's an immunity claim, that gives the Trump defense team the right, the legal right, to immediately appeal his denial,"" Cully Stimson, deputy director of the Heritage Foundation's Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told Fox News Digital. Stimson said that even if Merchan denies Trump's claim of immunity, the Trump team appeals the decision and an appellate court also denies Trump's claim, the president-elect would not face incarceration. ""For all intents and purposes, no matter what happens if [Merchan] denies it, and the appeals court… follow the judge, and then the judge gets to sentence him. Even then the Justice Department will come in and say, ‘Look, under the Supremacy Clause, you cannot impose a criminal sentence, especially one of incarceration on a sitting president.’ And so that case will be on ice until after Trump gets out of office. But as a practical matter, this case and the Fanni Willis case are over,"" he said. Trump pleaded not guilty in the case and denied any such affair with Daniels. The now-president-elect had railed against the trial as a ""sham,"" while calling Merchan ""corrupt"" and ""conflicted,"" appearing to refer to the judge's familial ties to the Democratic Party. Trump also lambasted the case as ""lawfare"" promoted by the Biden-Harris administration to hurt his chances of succeeding in the 2024 presidential election. Trump cannot pardon himself upon his inauguration, as it was a state case. Stimson continued that, considering the Supreme Court's ruling on immunity, it would be impossible to take a scalpel to the case and remove the evidence connected to Trump's first White House administration and ""official acts"" in the position from the evidence connected to his life before he was president. ""[Merchan] is not your traditional judge, but he's not going to say there's no immunity for Trump because... the highest court in the land has said that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for their official acts, and so he's going to have to recognize that the question is whether he has the temperament and the judgment — which he has proven not to, at least so far — to apply that in a fair and impartial manner and dismiss the charges,"" Stimson told Fox News Digital. ""By dismissing the charges, that just puts the ball back in Alvin Bragg's court. If Alvin Bragg wants to double down on stupid, which he's done a lot, he can [reopen the case]. But he's not going to get anywhere with that, because by then, the president will have assumed office. And the Justice Department will move under the Supremacy Clause that you cannot bring your case, your criminal case, against a sitting president while he's the president,"" he continued.Fox contributor and former Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Andrew McCarthy also wrote in an op-ed for Fox Digital this week that Trump would not face prison time in the case. ""Understand, Trump is not going to prison even if Merchan metes out an incarceration sentence. Though the charges are felonies, they are not sufficiently serious under New York law to merit immediate detention; Trump will get bail pending appeal,"" he wrote. ""Given that Trump is not going to be sent to Rikers Island by a Manhattan judge in any event, it would be prudent to postpone the sentence and allow Trump to pursue his immunity appeal. That would avoid the unseemliness of subjecting the next president of the United States to a criminal conviction and sentence when he is about to take office,"" he continued. ""Lawfare was terrible for the country. The resounding win Americans have given Trump should be its death knell,"" McCarthy added later in his piece.

"At final Harris rally, Oprah warns a Trump presidency could end voting rights","Shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris took the stage on the ""Rocky Steps"" of the Philadelphia Art Museum at her final rally before Election Day, billionaire Oprah Winfrey declared her fear a Donald Trump presidency could curtail Americans' right to vote.Winfrey was introduced by Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff around 11 PM ET on Monday, and brought to the dais with her 10 first-time voters who have or will be casting a ballot for Harris, including MLS Philadelphia Union forward Eddy Davis III.Winfrey recounted hiking on a recent Sunday and meeting a woman who said she would ""sit this [election] out.""""So I said, ‘sit this one out’.

We are optimistic, and we are excited about what we can do together. And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America.""Harris went on to pledge that she will be a president who knows the ""true measure of a leader is not based on who you beat down but who you lift up.""""It is my pledge to you that if you give me a chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way… Instead of stewing over an enemies list, I will spend every day on your behalf working on my to-do list full of priorities to improve your lives.""Chants of ""we are not going back"" soon erupted.She added that she will listen to people who disagree with her and that they will have a ""seat at the table"" as is custom for ""strong leaders.""""I pledge to put country above party and self and to be a president for all Americans,"" she said. ""We are the promise of America.""Harris also credited Republicans who may or may not have ever voted for a Democrat in the past but endorsed her in this cycle. Such figures have included former Rep.

"Trump merchandise outsells pro-Harris by striking margin, as Election Day draws near","A new survey analyzed how much Trump and Harris merchandise was bought on Amazon this election season — and the difference is stark.Omnisend, a marketing automation platform, recently published its findings in a report called ""Multimillion-dollar election merch industry: What will happen to it after elections?"". The research was conducted by Cint, a technology research firm, in August 2024.Researchers organized a survey with 1,000 participants across America with a margin of error of +/-3%, and analyzed merchandise sales trends from April to September 2024 using Jungle Scout software.The report found that pro-Trump merchandise generated more than five times more cash than pro-Harris merchandise. Amazon sellers made $140 million selling Trump merchandise from April to September, while Harris merchandise sellers made $26 million.The study noted that $41.6 million was spent on Trump merchandise in July, the same month that the former president was shot by a gunman at a Pennsylvania rally.The study accounts for the fact that Harris did not announce her presidential campaign until July, but the difference in sales between the two in August and September were stark.In August, merchants made $27.86 million selling Trump gear while pro-Harris products generated $11.52 million in revenue. The difference grew in September, when Trump merchandise sellers made $31.89 million and Harris merchandise sales were $10.43 million.Omnisend noted that the merchandise analysis reflects ""the strong demand [for pro-Trump merch] among [Trump's] loyal base.""""From flags to MAGA hats, Trump’s merch continues to dominate the market,"" the company noted, while adding that Harris' numbers were still impressive.""Harris’ rise in merch sales aligns with her increasing popularity and engagement since entering the race, signaling growing support for her campaign,"" the study said. ""These figures highlight not only the scale of the political merch industry but also the fierce competition between candidates to capture voter enthusiasm through merchandise sales.""Trump flags, hats and shirts remained the most profitable items, while birthday cards, mugs, yard signs and stickers also sold for millions.""Flags have proven to be the most popular Trump-branded item, accounting for 30% of total sales and generating $40M in revenue,"" Omnisend noted. ""Alongside flags, nearly one million MAGA hats have flown off the shelves, solidifying Trump merch as a must-have for supporters.""""Among the standout sellers is Walker’s earmuffs featuring Trump’s campaign logo, which brought in an estimated $3M for a single seller since being listed at the end of the summer,"" the study added. ""Many of the stores selling Trump merch also offer customizable items like t-shirts, cups, and hats.""The study also found that 58% of Americans have purchased, or plan to purchase, presidential election merchandise — which indicates ""a rising interest in using merch as a way to express political support.""""Brands can connect with customers by focusing on universal values and themes related to civic engagement, such as voting or community involvement,"" Omnisend senior e-commerce expert Greg Zakowicz suggested to brands in the report.

Harris caught on hot mic admitting her campaign is struggling with male voters,"Vice President Harris was surprised to find out a microphone was homing in on her conversation with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as she admitted her campaign was struggling with male voters.Harris and Whitmer were sitting at a bar in Kalamazoo, Michigan, on Saturday and having what appeared to be a serious conversation – so serious that on a video making the rounds online, the Democratic presidential nominee seemed to forget the two of them were surrounded by cameras and microphones.""So, my thing is we need to move ground among men,"" Harris was heard telling Whitmer at the Trak Houz Bar and Grill.Harris then immediately noticed the microphones were picking up on her conversation with the Democratic governor.""Oh, we have microphones in here just listening to everything,"" Harris says, looking flustered. ""I didn’t realize that!""Fox News has reached out to the campaign for clarification on the comment.Fox News’ Gillian Turner reported that it was both former President Trump’s and Harris’ last chance to close the gender gap that has been widening since Harris became the presidential nominee for the Democratic Party.The latest polls from the New York Times show Harris leading Trump with women voters, 54% to 42%, while Trump leads Harris among men voters, 55% to 41%, respectively.Last week, Harris dismissed her diminishing support among male voters during an interview with NBC’s Peter Alexander, who asked why she thought there was a disconnect between her and men.At first, Harris dodged the question, pointing to the live audience consisting of people from all backgrounds and genders who continue to show up to her events. She also said she was campaigning to earn the vote of every American.Alexander pressed Harris even more, asking what might explain the gap in support from men, and the vice president said it was not her experience.In contrast, the GenForward poll from the University of Chicago that was released last Wednesday revealed that 26% of Black men between the ages of 18 and 40 said they would vote for Trump, while only 12% of Black women said the same.

"Who are Trump's likely top contenders to lead comms team, interact with the media?","President-elect Donald Trump is on a Cabinet announcement spree just a week after his massive win against Vice President Kamala Harris, with his eyes locked on who he will announce to head up his White House communications team. Karoline Leavitt is the leading name for press secretary after she worked as the Trump campaign’s national press secretary throughout the high-stakes election cycle. Alina Habba, Trump’s legal spokeswoman and adviser, was also viewed as a front-runner for the position but said Thursday she would ""be better served in other capacities.""""While I am flattered by the support and speculation, the role of Press Secretary is not a role I am considering. Although I love screaming from a podium I will be better served in other capacities. This adminstration is going to be epic! So proud of the Trump team, the latest appointments and 47!"" she posted to X on Thursday morning. Speculation has mounted that in addition to Leavitt – and previously Habba – Trump could potentially announce former President George W. Bush aide and CNN contributor Scott Jennings for the role, or longtime Trump adviser and ally Jason Miller, or campaign spokesman and adviser Steven Cheung. Other names floated as potential contenders include former ESPN host Sage Steele, RNC spokeswoman Elizabeth Pipko and former Trump administration official Monica Crowley.During Trump's first administration, the communications team saw, at times, a revolving door of press secretaries and communications directors. Back in 2016, Trump announced Sean Spicer as his first press secretary, who served in the position from Jan. 20, 2017 to July of that year. Spicer resigned after Trump named Anthony Scaramucci as communications director in a communications team shake-up. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who currently serves as governor of Arkansas, took over the position from July 2017 until July 2019. Scaramucci served as communications director for about 10 days before he was shown the door and has since been a top critic of the former and upcoming president. Spicer had also served as acting communications director during Trump’s first administration and was followed by Scaramucci, Hope Hicks, Bill Shine and finally Stephanie Grisham as communications directors. On the press secretary front, Grisham followed Sanders as press secretary, notably serving in the role in the early days of the pandemic before Kayleigh McEnany took over the role, serving in the position until President Biden’s inauguration in 2021. Trump’s second administration is already coming together at a much faster pace than during his 2016 transition phase, with Trump announcing 20 individuals for key Cabinet and administration positions as of Thursday. ""The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin, giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail — and his Cabinet picks reflect his priority to put America First. President Trump will continue to appoint highly qualified men and women who have the talent, experience and necessary skill sets to Make America Great Again,"" Leavitt told Fox News Digital when asked about Trump's speedy roll-out of Cabinet picks earlier this week. Trump tapped Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., for example, to serve as his national security adviser, announcing that pick on Tuesday, about three days ahead of his announcement for the same role in 2016, when he chose former Army Gen. Mike Flynn for the position about 10 days after Election Day. Trump also announced he chose former New York Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a pick Trump did not make until Dec. 7, 2016, when he tapped Scott Pruitt to serve in the role.Trump's first pick for his administration, Susie Wiles for chief of staff, was announced the day after the election, while his 2016 announcement of Reince Priebus as chief of staff was made five days after the election. Trump has made one communications appointment announcement, revealing on Wednesday that Taylor Budowich will serve as an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel. Trump did not announce his first press secretary pick back in 2016 until Dec. 22, 2016, though this year’s pick is anticipated to be publicly announced much sooner, similar to his Cabinet announcements.

Mutiny threat sparks House GOP infighting ahead of Trump visit: 'Just more stupid',"Tensions were high among House Republicans on Tuesday with a group of GOP hardliners threatening to protest Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership during the next day’s House GOP Conference leadership elections.Three sources told Fox News Digital that members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus were exploring ways to show their discontent with House GOP leaders during the closed-door races to decide who will likely lead the majority next year.Meanwhile, those threats sparked frustration among rank-and-file House Republicans, including one lawmaker who said such discussions were ""just more stupid.""The heart of the issue lies in proposed rule changes that the House GOP Conference will also vote on, including a measure pushed by some Republicans to punish colleagues who purposely sink their own party’s legislation on the House floor by stripping their committee assignments.Johnson told Politico on Tuesday evening that he would not support ""punitive"" measures against people who blockade the House floor, but sources signaled that would not be enough.""There's a difference between saying, ‘I don't support it’ and ‘I'm going to stop it.’ That's a big difference,"" one source said. ""His easy route is just to say, ‘All right, no rules changes. We're just going to go forward.’""Reports indicated earlier that Freedom Caucus members were looking for a candidate to challenge Johnson – something its chairman did not rule out.""Having two people in a race is kind of the norm,"" Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., told reporters when asked if his group was putting up a candidate. ""We can do this Soviet-style, or we can do it American-style.""But no one candidate appeared to emerge as of Tuesday night, though Fox News Digital’s sources said conservatives could still coalesce around someone.Instead, Johnson’s GOP critics could seek a recorded vote where they could either simply vote against his candidacy for speaker or write another name in via secret ballot, Fox News Digital was told.The discord comes as President-elect Donald Trump plans to address House Republicans on Wednesday morning ahead of their leadership races, two other sources familiar with planning told Fox News Digital.Several GOP lawmakers who spoke with Fox News Digital were frustrated that the public chaos that permeated the 118th Congress could once again rear its head – this time, when Republicans were poised to control all the levers of power in Washington.""Frankly, I am tired of the instigators. I am tired of the conflict for the sake of conflict-type nonsense that happened last session,"" Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., told Fox News Digital.Asked if lawmakers who help lead that charge should face consequences, Murphy said, ""Absolutely. You can put that with an exclamation mark.""Another GOP lawmaker said they were concerned about whether such a protest would lead to another messy House floor fight over the speakership, similar to the 15 rounds of voting ex-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., faced nearly two years ago.""What would worry me is if they're willing to take that battle to the floor again. That's where it doesn't serve any kind of positive purpose at that point,"" that lawmaker said.Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, posted on X, ""Enough is enough with the unserious political games – we have work to do.""Others who have criticized Johnson in the past – like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla. – signaled little appetite for supporting a challenger against Johnson, particularly if Trump backs the speaker on Wednesday morning.The Hill was first to report that House Freedom Caucus members were seeking a challenger to Johnson.",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mutiny-threat-sparks-house-gop-infighting-ahead-trump-visit-just-more-stupid
Harris-Trump showdown: The vice president gives closing argument with White House as backdrop,"Vice President Kamala Harris brought her presidential campaign to the nation's capital on Tuesday, as she delivered what was billed as her closing argument address to American voters.With one week until Election Day, the vice president and Democratic presidential nominee, speaking to a massive crowd of tens of thousands of people near the White House, called on Americans to ‘turn the page’ on former President Trump, the Republican nominee.""We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict. The fear and division,"" Harris said. ""It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next President of the United States of America.""And the vice president, painting a stark contrast with Trump, highlighted that ""this election is more than just a choice between two parties and two different candidates. It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American or ruled by chaos and division.""Harris delivered her address from the Ellipse, a large park located just south of the White House and north of the National Mall.The setting was symbolic for two reasons.First, the backdrop was the White House, where either Harris or Trump will soon succeed President Biden in the Oval Office.And second, Trump headlined a large rally of supporters at the Ellipse on Jan 6, 2021. Many of those who attended Trump's rally then marched to the U.S. Capital and joined other protesters in storming the building in an attempt to upend congressional certification of Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump.""Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,"" Harris said near the top of her 30-minute address.And she argued that Trump ""has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other.""""This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,"" she charged. And Harris claimed the former president was a ""petty tyrant"" and emphasized that it's time for America to reject ""the schemes of wannabe dictators"" and instead to ""start writing the next chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.""Trump, who has been indicted multiple times and made history as the first current or former president convicted in a criminal case, has regularly threatened during the 2024 campaign that if he returned to the White House, he would prosecute his political foes.And both Biden and Harris - who replaced her boss atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in July after Biden ended his re-election bid - have repeatedly warned voters that Trump poses a threat to democracy if he's re-elected.Harris, repeating a line she's used with frequency on the campaign trail in recent days, encouraged the crowd to consider two very different futures for the country depending on the outcome of the presidential election.""In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,"" Harris noted. ""On Day One, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.""And Harris argued that ""unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,"" The Democratic presidential nominee claimed that the former president ""wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at my table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans. To always put country above party and above self.""Harris also used her address to spotlight key policy goals, including working to restore nationwide access to abortion, expanding Medicare coverage for home health care, and boosting the supply of housing in the country.She also noted that ""many of you are still getting to know who I am"" after succeeding Biden just three months ago.Harris once again portrayed herself as a ""new generation"" of leader.""I have been honored to serve as Joe Biden's vice president, but I will bring my own experiences and ideas to the Oval Office. My presidency will be different because the challenges we face are different,"" she said.The Harris campaign said that 75,000 people were in attendance to witness the speech, as the crowd spilled out from the Ellipse across Constitution Avenue and onto the National Mall by the Washington Monument.Fox News witnessed multiple protesters being led away from the rally site during the address by the vice president.Responding to the speech, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt charged that ""Kamala Harris is lying, name-calling, and clinging to the past to avoid admitting the truth — the migrant crime crisis, sky-high inflation, and raging world wars are the result of her terrible policies.""Leavitt argued that the vice president ""has spent the past four years working hand-in-hand with Joe Biden to destroy our country – but now, she is lying about her record because she has zero policy solutions to offer.""And Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley charged that ""Kamala Harris will do anything but ‘turn the page’ today in Washington, D.C.—instead, she will stir up division because her America Last agenda has nothing to offer the American people.""Trump gave his closing argument at a large rally Sunday at New York City's Madison Square Garden, where the former president's message was partially out shined by controversial comments from speakers during the pre-show that grabbed national headlines. His message - ""Kamala broke it. I'll fix it.""Harris' address came as the latest national polls indicate a margin-of-error race between her and Trump. It's the same story with the most recent surveys in the seven crucial battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election.",29-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-showdown-vice-president-give-closing-argument-white-house-backdrop
"Harris greets Pennsylvania family on porch, suggests staging 'door knock'","Vice President Kamala Harris had a clear idea of where she wanted a family to stand as she talked to them during a door-knocking photo op in Pennsylvania. Harris joined canvassers in Reading, Pennsylvania, as cameras captured the Democratic presidential nominee walking up to the porch where one family was standing outside, saying ""Hi guys… sorry for the intrusion."" A man exclaims, ""Oh my gosh,"" as Harris embraces him, a woman and presumably their son. The man is heard saying ""I wasn't expecting that… thought it was Shapiro,"" referring to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who has been campaigning with Harris in recent days. ""Well, I want to door knock,"" Harris tells the family. ""Oh, you want to do a door knock?"" the man asks, before Harris says ""yes,"" and they all turn to walk back to the door as photographers reposition themselves for the shot. The couple stands in the door frame as cameras capture Harris speaking to them. Video of the encounter was amplified by former President Trump’s 2024 campaign on X.""Kamala's ‘door knocking’ in Pittsburgh involved her meeting supporters outside their home, then demanding they move to the doorway so the press could capture a fake door knock,"" Trump War Room wrote. ""Humiliating!"" Both Trump and Harris visited Pennsylvania on Monday to make a final pitch to voters in the key battleground state. Harris ended her night in Philadelphia at the Art Museum steps made famous in the movie ""Rocky,"" where she said ""the momentum is on our side."" She also rallied with supporters in Allentown, Scranton and Pittsburgh, and she swung through Reading to visit a Puerto Rican restaurant and do a little canvassing herself, knocking on doors alongside campaign volunteers.Trump started the day in North Carolina and finished it in Michigan, but he spoke in Reading and Pittsburgh in between. In Pittsburgh, Trump delivered what his campaign aides described as his closing argument, telling supporters, ""Over the past four years, Americans have suffered one catastrophic failure, betrayal and humiliation after another."" ""We do not have to settle for weakness, incompetence, decline and decay,"" he added. Pennsylvania has the most Electoral College votes of any battleground state, making it the top prize of the campaign. A victory there would clear a path to the White House for either candidate.",5-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-greets-pennsylvania-family-porch-suggests-staging-door-knock
"Supreme Court temporarily halts lower court ruling ordering 1,600 voters back on Virginia voter rolls","The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to take up an emergency challenge from Virginia, temporarily halting a federal judge's decision that ordered it to reinstate hundreds of potential noncitizens to the state's voter rolls. The decision is a victory for Gov. Glenn Youngkin and comes just days after the state of Virginia filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court to halt a lower court decision ordering it to restore the names of some 1,600 individuals to its voter rolls. ""We are pleased by the Supreme Court’s order today,"" Youngkin told Fox News in a statement following the decision, which he described as a ""victory for commonsense and election fairness.""""I am grateful for the work of Attorney General Jason Miyares on this critical fight to protect the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens,"" he added.At the heart of the case is whether Virginia’s voter removal process violates a so-called quiet period under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), or a federal law requiring states to halt all ""systematic"" voter roll maintenance for a 90-day period before a federal election.That argument pitted the Department of Justice — which sued the state over its removal program earlier this month — against Youngkin, who insisted the state's process is ""individualized"" and conducted in accordance with state and federal law. Justice Department officials reiterated their argument Wednesday following the Supreme Court decision. ""The Department brought this suit to ensure that every eligible American citizen can vote in our elections,"" they told Fox News in a statement. ""We disagree with the Supreme Court’s order.""With just days until the election, the court's decision is expected to be under the microscope.Virginia’s voter roll maintenance program was implemented in August and compares the state Department of Motor Vehicles’ list of self-identified noncitizens to its list of registered voters. Individuals without citizenship were flagged and informed that their voter registration would be canceled unless they could prove their citizenship in 14 days.The Justice Department argued that the removals were conducted too close to the Nov. 5 elections and violated the NVRA’s quiet period provision, a decision backed by a U.S. judge in Alexandria, who ordered Virginia last week to halt its removals and to reinstate the registrations of all 1,600 removed individuals. Justice Department officials also cited concerns in their lawsuit that eligible votes may have incorrectly been removed from the rolls without adequate notice or with enough time to correct the mistake. In the state’s petition to the Supreme Court, Virginia Attorney General Jason S. Miyares objected to the lawsuit and subsequent court ruling on several grounds. First, he argued the NVRA does not extend to ""self-identified noncitizens"" in the state — adopting a more narrow reading of the law than the Justice Department and one that he said could render the primary basis for the lawsuit obsolete. Second, he argued that if the NVRA does apply, the state still has an ""individualized process"" of removing voters that is conducted by the Department of Motor Vehicles and directly by local registration offices. Late Monday, attorneys general from all 26 Republican-led states joined Virginia in filing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, backing its assertion that the removal program was conducted on an ""individualized"" basis, and further, that the Justice Department’s reading of the protections granted under NVRA are overly broad and do not apply to noncitizens.Attorneys urged the court to grant Virginia’s emergency motion and ""restore the status quo,"" noting that doing so ""would comply with the law and enable Virginia to ensure that noncitizens do not vote in the upcoming election.""""This Court should reject Respondents’ effort to change the rules in the middle of the game and restore the status quo ante,"" they wrote. ""The Constitution leaves decisions about voter qualifications to the people of Virginia. And the people of Virginia have decided that noncitizens are not permitted to vote.""",30-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-temporarily-halts-lower-court-ruling-ordering-1600-voters-back-virginia-voter-rolls
House Republicans accuse White House of releasing 'false transcript' of Biden's 'garbage' remarks,"House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer accuse the White House of releasing a false transcript of President Biden’s remarks in which he apparently referred to supporters of former President Trump as ""garbage,"" warning that the revision could violate the Presidential Records Act. Fox News Digital obtained a letter Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Comer, R-Ky., sent to White House counsel Edward Siskel Wednesday afternoon in which they demand records relating to the remarks and the transcript are preserved. ""In less than one week, the American people will determine the winner of the 2024 presidential election. They will choose between two candidates: President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. President Biden — marred by unpopular policies, scandal, and apparent cognitive deterioration — has chosen not to pursue a second term in office,"" they wrote. ""President Biden, however, has continued to play a prominent role in Vice President Harris’s campaign and, indeed, is the most powerful mouthpiece for the Biden-Harris Administration’s policies and views that Ms. Harris presumably seeks to continue under a hypothetical Harris-Walz Administration."" Stefanik and Comer pointed to Biden’s remarks Tuesday night, saying, ""Americans were rightfully insulted, then, when President Biden, seeking to boost Ms. Harris’ presidential campaign, referred to an enormous swath of the country as ""floating … garbage.""""President Biden’s vindictive words were unsurprising, given his previous statements regarding people who choose not to vote for his preferred candidate,"" they wrote. ""Unsurprising too were the White House’s actions after he said them."" Stefanik and Comer said the White House, ""instead of apologizing or clarifying President Biden’s words,"" sought to ""change them (despite them being recorded on video) by releasing a false transcript of his remarks."" ""The move is not only craven, but it also appears to be in violation of federal law, including the Presidential Records Act of 1978,"" they wrote. ""White House staff cannot rewrite the words of the President of the United States to be more politically on message."" The letter comes after President Biden spoke during a Zoom call with Voto Latino, one of the largest Latino voter and civic outreach organizations in the U.S. Tuesday. Biden was asked about a comment made Sunday during a Trump rally at Madison Square Garden in which comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage.""Biden replied, ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters."" The White House has since denied that Biden called Trump supporters ""garbage"" and claimed the comment was taken out of context.The White House, on Wednesday, released a transcript of Biden’s remarks. The official White House transcript says, ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American."" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates sought to clarify Biden’s remarks, saying, ""The president referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage.’""And the president tweeted in the same vein. ""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,"" Biden posted to X. ""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation."" Now, Vice President Kamala Harris is seeking to distance herself from the remarks, but she's also defending the president, saying he ""clarified his comments."" ""But let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,"" Harris said.Harris, referring to her Tuesday night speech from the Ellipse near the White House, reiterated Wednesday how voters will decide ""who we are as a nation and whether we are going to be a nation of people who attempt to unify and break through this era of divisiveness, or are we going to be a nation of people who have a president stewing in the Oval Office over his enemies list.""You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career,"" Harris said. ""I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not, and as President of the United States, I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not.""The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. In their letter to White House counsel, Stefanik and Comer wrote, ""Though President Biden’s relevance continues to diminish, his words continue to matter, even as they become increasingly divisive and erratic."" Stefanik and Comer demanded the White House ""retain and preserve all documents and internal communications regarding President Biden’s statement and the release of the inaccurate transcript."" ""We also demand that the White House issue a corrected transcript with the accurate words,"" they wrote. Trump, at a rally in North Carolina Wednesday, said Biden and Harris have ""treated our whole country like garbage."" ""My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple: You can’t lead America if you don’t love Americans,"" Trump declared. ""And you can’t be president if you hate the American people, and there’s a lot of hatred there.""

"Trump, Harris nearly tied in battleground Wisconsin 8 days from Election Day, poll finds","Former President Trump and Vice President Harris are nearly tied in Wisconsin, a key battleground state, with just eight days until Election Day, according to a new poll.A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released Monday found Trump and Harris neck and neck in Wisconsin, 48% to 47%, respectively, from a statewide poll of 500 likely voters. The razor-thin results fell within the margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.Harris, however, leads Trump in Door County, Wisconsin, which has been a predictor of which candidate takes the White House. The poll of 300 likely voters in Door County found Harris leading Trump in that area 50% to 47%, which is within the margin of error of 5.7 percentage points. Wisconsin is one of three Rust Belt states that voted for Trump in 2016, then flipped back to the Democrats in 2020. President Biden won the state by just 20,682 votes, or 0.7 points.In Wisconsin, which is defined by its White working-class population like other competitive Midwestern states, 58% of the state’s voters are White without a college degree, according to the Fox News Voter Analysis. That is 15 points higher than the national electorate.The USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll also found that in Wisconsin, Harris has a 14-point lead over Trump among women, 55% to 41%, respectively. The result flips to Trump’s favor among men, showing Trump ahead 18 percentage points over Harris, 56% to 38%, respectively.Wisconsin is one of the three so-called ""Blue Wall"" states – the others being Michigan and Pennsylvania – that make up seven swing states that will ultimately decide the election. Harris and Trump are aggressively competing in these states, which also include Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.As of Monday morning, early voters in Wisconsin cast 850,163 ballots, whereas nationwide more than 41 million votes have already been cast in the election.

Republicans within striking distance of House majority as key races remain too close to call,"The majority in the House of Representatives appears within reach for Republicans, who have already won control of the Senate and the White House.Associated Press race projections show Republicans holding 211 seats compared to 199 seats for Democrats as of Friday morning.A total of five sitting House lawmakers are projected to lose their re-election bids so far — three Republicans and two Democrats.Several races involving GOP incumbents in California are still too close to call and are likely to be pivotal to the House majority.Republicans in three Arizona districts, as well as GOP lawmakers in Nebraska, Iowa and Oregon, are also still awaiting result projections.Whichever party reaches 218 seats first will hold the House majority in the 119th Congress.House Republican leaders have been touting confidence in their eventual victory, with the top four House leaders already formally announcing bids to hold the same spots in a January House majority.""It appears we're going to hold the House and flip the Senate,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News Digital on Wednesday night. ""California's the main state still. You know, in a lot of those close races, our incumbents are leading the way — by small margins, but we knew there would be small margins.""It's a far cry from House Democrats, whose hopes of winning the majority are rapidly decreasing. Multiple sources told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that Democrats were bracing for Republicans to win complete control of Congress and the White House.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., pointed out that a Republican victory is not a forgone conclusion, however.""It has yet to be decided who will control the House of Representatives in the 119th Congress. We must count every vote and wait until the results in Oregon, Arizona and California are clear,"" Jeffries said in a statement that also congratulated President-elect Trump.Democrats have scored key wins in projections by unseating Republican incumbents in three New York seats — Reps. Marc Molinaro, Brandon Williams and Anthony D'Esposito.Republicans are projected to flip three seats as well — one vacated by a Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., to run for Senate, and two districts held by moderate Democrats in Pennsylvania.

Trump has held at least six news conferences where he took questions from the media since the beginning of August. Harris has done several brief, informal press gaggles this week with the media while on the campaign trail, including on Monday when she criticized the tone and rhetoric at Trump's rally in New York City over the weekend. On Saturday, she appeared on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" as herself in the show's cold open.She gave a speech on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., outlining her path forward for the United States and how she differs from what she calls Trump's radical, dark vision.Harris also ended her streak of not appearing on Fox News last month, sitting for an interview in Pennsylvania with chief political anchor Bret Baier.

"Hamas reacts to Trump victory, says he must 'work seriously to stop the war' in Gaza","The Palestinian terrorist group Hamas said Wednesday that the incoming administration of presidential election winner Donald Trump must ""work seriously to stop the war"" in the Gaza Strip. The declaration comes after a report emerged claiming Trump asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to wrap up the conflict by the time he gets inaugurated on Jan. 20 if he had won the election. Trump ultimately prevailed over Vice President Kamala Harris. Hamas said, ""In light of the initial results showing Donald Trump winning in the U.S. presidential elections,"" they believe he is ""required to listen to the voices that have been raised by the U.S. public for more than a year regarding the [Israeli] aggression on the Gaza Strip."" The incoming Trump administration must ""work seriously to stop the war of genocide and aggression against our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, stop the aggression against the brotherly Lebanese people, stop providing military support and political cover to the Zionist entity, and to recognize the legitimate rights of our people,"" Hamas added. Hamas also said the ""new US administration must realize that our Palestinian people will continue to resist the hateful [Israeli] occupation and will not accept any path that detracts from their legitimate rights to freedom, independence, self-determination, and the establishment of their independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital."" A source from the Times of Israel said Trump initially gave the message to Netanyahu about ending the war when the Israeli leader visited him at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, in July. The Biden-Harris administration has been largely supportive of Israel, though the White House has spoken out against the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) recent military operations.

""PPT exposed a number of potential violations and filed several complaints against appointees in the department and its component agencies to help preserve what little remains of the public’s trust.""The report outlines how Biden's Department of Interior (DOI) ""has a record of cutting ethical corners in favor of special interest policies"" and that the Department of Energy has given DOI a ""run for its money"" with its own questionable ethics decisions.""Ethics issues in the Biden-Harris administration didn’t end with Hunter Biden and the president’s family,"" Michael Chamberlain, Director of Protect the Public’s Trust, told Fox News Digital. ""Despite their claims to be the most ethical in history, we’ve documented possible ethics violations in most of the Cabinet-level agencies, including confirmed Hatch Act violations, conflicts of interest, and all the hazards that come with having a revolving door between official D.C. and well-connected activist groups.""""While others have found similar Biden-Harris breaches, they are not the groups and media outlets that were so enthusiastic about uncovering problems in the last administration. Just because the public hasn’t heard much about these in the legacy media, we caution everyone to beware of future attempts to paint this as a ‘scandal-free’ administration,"" he added.The report concludes by saying many of their documented complaints have led to ""investigations by Inspectors General, the Office of Special Counsel or other investigative bodies, or prompting letters from Congressional committees.""""As is often the case when it comes to government, sunlight is the best disinfectant,"" the report concluded. ""The light we have shone on these incidents may be useful when revisionist historians begin twisting their tales in the coming years, to help expose the myth of a ‘scandal-free’ administration as just that: a myth.""Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response.",31-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-watchdog-report-shatters-biden-harris-narrative-ethics-transparency-myth
Harris campaign reportedly spent 6 figures on ‘Call Her Daddy’ podcast with fewer than 1 million YouTube views,"The Harris campaign spent a massive sum of money for a podcast that got a fraction of the viewership President-elect Trump won on ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" according to a new report.The Washington Examiner publish a report Friday with details on how the Harris campaign spent their $1 billion war chest, with one particular expenditure raising some eyebrows.""A source familiar with the matter told the Washington Examiner that the Harris campaign spent six figures on building a set for Harris’s appearance on the popular Call Her Daddy podcast with host Alex Cooper,"" The Examiner wrote. ""The interview came out in October and was reportedly filmed in a hotel room in Washington, D.C.""One of the major takeaways many media commentators have noted in the aftermath of Trump’s electoral victory is the power of podcasts to reach voters. Trump’s Oct. 25 appearance on Rogan has well over 47 million views on YouTube, while Harris’ on the raunchy women's sex and relationship-focused ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast has failed to break 1 million, at 813,201 views since being uploaded Oct. 6.Rogan said he had been in negotiations with Harris' team for her to appear on his podcast, but plans were scrapped when she refused to come record at his studio in Austin, Texas.The Examiner also reported that the campaign spent $15 million on ""event production,"" with $1 million going to Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Productions.Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign but did not receive an immediate reply.""Money can’t buy you love or a good candidate,"" Republican political strategist Brad Todd told The Examiner of the Harris campaign’s massive spending.""Advertising is a pretty important source of information for swing voters,"" Todd said. ""It no doubt matters, but it’s not enough. It doesn’t matter if you have the wrong message and it’s not delivered in a compelling way.

House Democrat says the party needs to get past 'Trump Derangement Syndrome',"A House Democrat is arguing that their party needs to get past ""this idea they call 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'"" as President-elect Donald Trump is gearing up for another term in the White House. The lawmaker, speaking to Axios about how Democrats should approach Trump’s second term, suggested they ought to ""pick and choose"" their battles this time around. ""Democrats just literally attacked everything he did. We could never agree with anything, never give him credit for anything, could never say, 'Well actually securing the border is a good idea, I just disagree with how he's doing it,'"" the House Democrat was quoted as saying in the wake of Vice President Kamala Harris’ election loss. The discussion about Democrats reworking their strategy for Trump comes as they have been weighing in on what they believe went wrong for Harris, ranging from her choice of Tim Walz as running mate to select comments she made on national television while campaigning. Mark Penn, a former Clinton adviser who is a Fox News contributor, wrote among his ""lessons of the election"" that ""America is a center right country at heart."" ""Only 25 percent are liberal and the other 75 percent won’t be ruled by the 25,"" he posted on X early Thursday. ""Campaigns are about issues and serious proposals and positions and you can’t avoid having them.""""Voters don’t listen to Hollywood celebrities when it comes to voting,"" Penn continued. ""Most voters see Hollywood as great for entertaining but as far removed from their concerns when it comes to voting."" In the waning days of Harris’ campaign, she had brought out celebrities such as Bruce Springsteen and Eminem in an attempt to appeal to swing state voters. ""Identity politics is ultimately losing politics as voters care more about issues not identity when living their lives,"" Penn also said. ""And finally, Joe Biden should never have run for re-election."" ",7-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-democrat-says-party-needs-get-past-trump-derangement-syndrome
Melania Trump questions 'whether Jill's concern was genuine' following Trump assassination attempt,"Former first lady Melania Trump said she questions whether current first lady Jill Biden's ""concern was genuine"" following the first assassination attempt against President-elect Donald Trump in July, due to her rhetoric about her husband in the days leading up to the incident. Trump, in an interview with French publication ""Paris Match"" last month, said that Biden ""took the initiative to contact me directly"" after ""someone tried to murder my husband in Pennsylvania"" during his rally on July 13.""I do question, however, whether Jill’s concern was genuine as a few days prior she referred to my husband as ‘evil’ and a ‘liar,’"" Trump said. ""It was obvious that the onslaught of rhetoric from Democrat leaders and the mainstream media was so deeply embedded in our nation’s consciousness it prompted an attempt to assassinate Donald."" Trump’s interview was conducted before President-elect Trump won the 2024 presidential election. President-elect Trump is in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday for meetings with House Republicans on Capitol Hill, and he will return to the White House for the first time since leaving in 2021 Wednesday for a meeting with President Biden. Mrs. Trump, however, will not attend the meeting at the White House. ""Her husband’s return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success,"" her spokesperson said. Meanwhile, in the interview, Trump said that while she was ""relieved to learn my husband was safe, it was evident that the forces behind this wicked behavior won’t come to an end."" ""Simply put, they want Donald out.  They won’t stop. Has the concept of ‘respect’ become antiquated?  Can opposing sides prioritize decency, come together, and coexist?"" she questioned. ""Doubtful, as the Democrat political engine peddles harsh words, vile names, and labels our nation’s 45th President ‘a threat to democracy.’"" She added, ""People today are so desensitized they actually joke about killing a former U.S. President."" Mrs. Trump said that ""it is undeniable that this type of speech created a toxic political environment.""""This relentless vilification deepened the political divide in America, and now compromises those individuals who dare to stand-up for their own beliefs,"" she said. ""We are dangerously close to the edge of a different type of societal change.  It is time to be introspective, rewire ourselves, and discover the root cause of this egoism.  It is incumbent upon every American to begin posing these questions in order to ensure the survival of our nation. We now live in a post-respect world."" She added, ""I guess nothing in politics is sacred anymore."" President-elect Trump, after the second assassination attempt against him in September, in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, also blamed Democrats’ rhetoric for the violence. ""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out,"" Trump said in September.",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trump-questions-whether-jills-concern-genuine-following-trump-assassination-attempt
GOP challenger unseats Rep. Susan Wild in Pennsylvania,"Republican Pennsylvania House candidate Ryan Mackenzie defeated incumbent Democratic Rep. Susan Wild in the state's 7th Congressional District race. Wild announced that she conceded the race in a post on X early on Wednesday.Wild has represented Pennsylvania's 7th Congressional District, which encompasses counties such as Carbon, Lehigh, and Northampton, since 2018, and was expected to face a tough election battle by her own party. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee identified the district as vulnerable to Republican defeat when heading into the election cycle earlier this year.The Democratic House member ran on a platform of protecting access to abortion, fighting LGBT discrimination, affordable housing, and investing in infrastructure. Wild, who was backed by President Biden this cycle, overwhelmingly votes along party lines, with FiveThirtyEight data showing she has voted for legislation supported by Biden 100% of the time. Mackenzie, on the other hand, campaigned on securing the U.S. border, energy independence, cutting taxes, and trimming government spending. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Mackenzie earlier this year, after the 45th president withheld an endorsement for the district’s 2022 race, when Wild faced Republican challenger Lisa Scheller.""Ryan Mackenzie has my Complete and Total Endorsement — HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social in August. Mackenzie currently serves in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, a seat he’s held since 2012 including amid redistricting. Wild has faced tough re-election bids since the 2022 cycle, when redistricting over the 2020 Census took effect and included votes from Republican-friendly Carbon County. Ahead of her 2022 race, Wild came under the national spotlight when she said she ""might have to school"" rural Trump voters in order to win their support. In a Zoom call earlier this year, Wild recalled how she felt when she learned that her constituency would include a county that ""drank the Trump Kool-Aid"" after the electoral boundaries for her congressional district were redrawn. ""After Trump came along, it went from a sort of working-class blue district to a – they drank the Trump Kool-Aid – and it really became a red county. So, I was dismayed when I got that as part of my district,"" she said. Wild later apologized ""to anyone I may have offended"" over the comment. Pennsylvania emerged as a key battleground state for the presidential race this cycle. Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

Larry Kudlow to remain at helm of FOX Business show amid Trump admin reports,"FOX Business host Larry Kudlow has no plans to leave his media role amid reports detailing that President-elect Trump was eyeing him for a position in the administration. ""Larry Kudlow recently signed a new deal to continue hosting his eponymous program on FOX Business and has no plans to leave his current role helming one of the highest rated shows on the network,"" a Fox News Media spokesperson said Friday. Kudlow is the host of FOX Business’ ""Kudlow,"" and previously served as the director of the National Economic Council under Trump’s first administration. He had been floated as a top contender to join Trump’s second administration, as reports spread that the former and upcoming president was eyeing him for a top economic role in his administration, such as overseeing the Treasury Department or again reclaiming his role on the National Economic Council. Following Trump’s massive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week — when he swept the seven battleground states and earned 312 electoral votes and the popular vote — Kudlow praised Trump’s economic policies, shutting down criticisms that the second Trump administration would further drive inflation that spiraled under the Biden administration. ""The day after the election, on Wednesday, November 6, the stock market registered its largest rally in history. Mr. Trump is an avid follower of the stock market, as I can attest during his first term — when almost any time I went into the Oval Office, no matter what the agenda, his first question to me would be the stock market,"" Kudlow said earlier this week on ""Kudlow."" ""Stocks can change their minds, but Mr. Trump is well aware that they are a predictor of the future economy — and send thumbs up or thumbs down regarding economic policy. All these Nobel Prize winning economists keep telling people how bad Trump's agenda is, but the stock market begs to differ. Tax cuts, deregulation, and energy dominance — three key pillars of Mr. Trump's economic plan — are very bullish for future economic growth and profits. Hence, stocks keep rallying,"" he added. Kudlow joined the first Trump administration in 2018, succeeding Gary Cohn as director of the National Economic Council until 2021. He then joined FOX Business, following the conclusion of the first Trump administration. In addition to his career in the media, Kudlow served as associate director for economics and planning in the Office of Management and Budget under the Reagan administration, and also as Bear Stearns’ chief economist in the late 1980s and into the '90s. Kudlow currently serves as vice chair of the board for the America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit research institute led by former senior leaders from the Trump administration. The group works to advance ""policies that put the American people first."" Trump has been on an announcement blitz since last week as he rolls out his picks for his second administration, including naming high-profile choices such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to lead the State Department; and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as attorney general.",15-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/larry-kudlow-remain-helm-fox-business-show-amid-trump-admin-reports
"Trump plans to shift school funding control to local communities, has yet to pick DOE secretary","President-Elect Donald Trump has proposed a dramatic shakeup in American education: ""disbanding"" or drastically reducing the power of the Department of Education (DOE), a move that would shift control and funding of public schools back to local communities.While Trump's specific plan and choice of secretary have yet to be announced, Neal McCluskey, the director for educational freedom at libertarian think tank Cato Institute, said there's a high likelihood Trump's agenda of shuttering the DOE could be carried out through ""block granting.""""Block granting is a little easier for people to understand, because it takes money and it doesn't just suddenly go away from states and districts, it keeps it,"" McCluskey told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""It just gives them more control over it.""""This would be a pretty big change if it went from the federal government giving out money with all kinds of rules and regulations through a whole bunch of different programs, to the federal government consolidating almost every K-12 and giving them the money,"" he said.McCluskey noted a shift in the federal government’s role in education, moving from funding support to more direct control, particularly until the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015, which rolled back some federal oversight due to backlash against standardized testing and federal mandates. While ESSA reduced federal intervention, he believes funding pressures keep pushing Washington to influence school operations.""I think that higher education, the Department of Education, has proved itself to be just a bad administrator,"" McCluskey said. ""The bungling of simplifying FAFSA, the student aid for. It's sort of ironic that it's making it easier, making the form easier that they just couldn't handle.""""I also think the programs are really bad,"" he added.While McCluskey acknowledged a legitimate role for federal civil rights enforcement, he argued it should be housed within the Department of Justice, not education. He cautioned against overreach, particularly with ""Dear Colleague"" letters from the Office of Civil Rights, which, he argued, altered policies unilaterally without formal changes in the law.In 1979, Congress passed and President Jimmy Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act, leading to the creation of the department, which began its operations in May 1980 under the Carter administration. In his 1982 State of the Union address, former President Reagan called for shuttering the department.McCluskey said the DOE started largely as a political move to gain National Education Association support and initially focused on K-12 and student-aid funding.Although intended to equalize funding between low- and high-income communities, its role expanded over time to include accountability measures, especially from the Reagan era onward, as concerns grew about educational quality and outcomes. This push for accountability led to the ""A Nation at Risk"" report in 1983 and eventually to the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002, positioning the federal government as a major driver of standards and test-based accountability.  However, backlash against centralized standard testing like Common Core led to a retreat from heavy oversight, and today the department’s primary roles are K-12 funding support, federal student aid management, and civil rights enforcement, he said.So far, Fox News Digital has learned former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Rep. Byron Donalds, Cade Brumley, Rep. Virginia Foxx, Tiffany Justice, Oklahoma public education superintendent Ryan Walters and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin could be possible contenders for the DOE secretary role.",13-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-plans-shift-school-funding-control-local-communities-has-yet-pick-doe-secretary
"Harris heckled at Pennsylvania church, says voting for her fulfills God's expectation 'for us to help Him'","Vice President Harris was interrupted by a heckler while she was speaking in a Pennsylvania church on Sunday meant to highlight her faith in the battleground state nine days before Election Day. From the lectern at the Church of Christian Compassion in West Philadelphia, Harris was referencing the biblical story of the Apostle Paul when someone began shouting. Harris stopped speaking and clapped, as the church band sounded music to drown out the heckler, who was not captured on event cameras. ""That's why we fight for democracy,"" Harris repeated as the heckler was escorted out. ""Every voice is important,"" she said, clapping. ""Every voice is important."" The interruption was over in less than two minutes and Harris continued her message. At the beginning of her remarks, Harris had suggested that voting for her fulfills God's will.""In just nine days, we have the power to decide the fate of our nation for generations to come. And on this day, then on this beautiful Sunday morning, I am reminded God expects us to help Him,"" Harris said through laughter, garnering applause. ""We got work to do."" ""Like Paul, we must remember that divine power works through our actions, and we have the power to move past division, fear and chaos,"" Harris told the congregation later on. ""It is in and within our power to fulfill the promise of America and the promise to create opportunity for every child and to protect our basic freedoms, the power to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God power the Black Church understood and has used for generations.""As she has done in past addresses to Black congregations in recent weeks, Harris attempted to contrast herself against ""those who seek to deepen division, to spread hate, to sow fear, and to cause chaos, who suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down."" ""Here in Pennsylvania right now, each of us has an opportunity to make a difference, because in this moment, we do face a real question: what kind of country do we want to live in? What kind of country do we want for our children and our grandchildren?"" Harris said. ""A country of chaos… fear and hate, or a country of freedom, justice and compassion. And the great thing about living in a democracy is We the People have the choice to answer that question.""""So let us answer not just with our words, but with our works. Yes, with our prayers, but also with our pressing. Yes, with our faith and also our faith, but also our feet. As we walk to the polls,"" Harris said. ""And yes, in these nine days, these next nine days will test us. They will demand everything we've got. But when I think about the days ahead and the God we serve, yeah, I am confident that His power will work through us. Because, church, I know we were born for a time such as this."" Harris cited her campaign theme of ""joy.""""In times of uncertainty, Scripture reminds us weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning,"" Harris said in closing. ""The path may seem hard, the work may seem heavy, but joy cometh in the morning. And church, morning is on its way. God bless you. God bless America.""

Elon Musk's pro-Trump stance causes progressives to flee X for liberal safe space,"Liberal pundits and media outlets are fleeing the Elon Musk-owned platform, X, after President-elect Donald Trump won a second White House term.Trump's reelection set off a wave of notable departures from the platform, which Musk has used to openly and loudly express his support for the president-elect. Liberal users are moving instead to Bluesky, a decentralized platform that has reportedly gained more than a million new users since the election, according to the New York Times. Left-leaning publications and media figures have hailed the platform as an alternative to X without Trump-supporting Musk at the helm. The Guardian cited ""experts"" who described Bluesky as a ""refuge from the far-right activism on X,"" while the Times reported that many of the new accounts created are ""left-leaning.""Last week, MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace told viewers that she deleted her X app in an ""act of self-preservation."" ""I deleted Twitter today as an act of self-preservation and because I was no longer able to find the things I was interested in. I was seeing a lot of things that I’m not,"" she said. Wallace's account remains active on the platform.Ex-CNN host Don Lemon posted a statement announcing his departure from X on Wednesday, telling his 1.5M followers that ""it's time for me to leave the platform.""""I once believed it was a place for honest debate and discussion, transparency and free speech, but I now feel it does not serve that purpose,"" he wrote, signing off his message with his new Bluesky handle.Lemon cited X's new terms of service, which will go into effect later this week, as the final straw that led to his departure. The incoming terms mandate that all legal disputes be brought exclusively before Texas courts, where X is headquartered. Lemon cited the Washington Post's claim that the Texas courts will be a ""hub for conservatives"" which could ""make it easier for X to shield itself from and punish critics.""Earlier Wednesday, the Guardian announced that it would suspend all of its 80 accounts on X, slamming the platform as ""toxic"" while accusing Musk of ""using its influence to shape political discourse,"" Deadline reported.""We think that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives and that resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere,"" the Guardian told readers.""The U.S. presidential election served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse,"" the publication said.Actress Jamie Lee Curtis also bid farewell to the platform on Wednesday, posting a screenshot of her account deactivation message with the caption, ""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. Courage to change the things I can. And the wisdom to know the difference."" In a subsequent post on Bluesky, Curtis posted, ""#WeDontNeedX.""The departures come one day after Trump announced that Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, aimed at ""dismantling Government Bureaucracy"" cutting  ""wasteful expenditures"" and restructuring Federal Agencies.Musk, who prides himself as a ""free speech absolutist"", purchased the platform in April 2022 with his stated intention to make Twitter an even playing field for liberals and conservatives alike. His goal was to put an end to the grip liberal-heavy Sillicon Valley had on tech companies. Bluesky, was created in 2019 as a project by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey but became an independent company in 2022.

"Coverage of Trump, Harris in presidential race 'most lopsided in history,' 85% negative for Trump: report","Coverage on ABC, CBS and NBC News of the presidential race between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris has been the most ""lopsided in history,"" a new study released one week before the election found.Analysis from the Media Research Center (MRC) published Monday found that Harris has received 78% positive coverage on broadcast evening news since July, versus Trump, who has been the subject of 85% negative coverage on the same networks.""The difference in coverage between the two candidates is far greater than in 2016, when both Trump and then-challenger Hillary Clinton received mostly negative coverage [91% negative for Trump, vs. 79% negative for Clinton,]"" according to MRC analysts.The disparity between the Trump and Harris coverage is even greater than in 2020, ""when Joe Biden was treated to 66% positive coverage, vs. 92% negative for Trump,"" the study reads.MRC reported that ABC, CBS and NBC have spent more than 200 minutes of airtime, most of it negative, harping on controversies surrounding Trump while glossing over or, in many cases, outright ignoring controversies related to Harris - such as plagiarism accusations and allegations surrounding her husband, Doug Emhoff.""Instead, Harris’ coverage has been larded with enthusiastic quotes from pro-Harris voters, creating a positive ‘vibe’ for the Democrat even as network reporters criticize Trump themselves,"" MRC writes.Analysts reviewed more than 600 segments about the presidential race that aired on ABC, CBS or NBC beginning on the day President Biden suspended his candidacy in late July, through October 25.After weeks of glowing coverage for Harris as the Democratic nominee, the three networks seemingly changed their tone following the debate between Harris and Trump in September, the MRC analysts found.""The networks shifted attention away from Harris, spending significantly more airtime targeting Trump,"" the report reads.""From the date Harris entered the race on July 21 through September 10, she received 353 minutes of network evening news coverage, virtually identical to the 355 minutes given Trump during the same period. Since then, however, TV has focused nearly twice as much attention on Trump as Harris: 398 minutes for the former President, compared to just 230 minutes for the Vice President,"" the study found.""The additional airtime for Trump was hardly meant as a gift. Instead, it reflected the networks’ intensive focus on Trump controversies, providing opportunities for negative news coverage,"" according to MRC.Roughly 31% of the 753 minutes of evening news spent on Trump since July 21 spotlighted his personal controversies, the study found. ""This compares to barely five percent of Harris’s airtime [28 minutes, out of a total 583 minutes of coverage] spent on similar topics.The networks repeatedly cited January 6 and Trump’s claim that the 2020 election was rigged while labeling him as a ""danger to democracy,"" MRC reported.Comparatively, ""Harris faced no such onslaught. Over fourteen weeks, evening news viewers heard a scant 5 minutes, 22 seconds of GOP criticisms that she’s too liberal, barely one-sixth the airtime spent on the claim Trump is a ‘fascist.’ None of this coverage included any criticisms of Harris from either network reporters or nonpartisan sources,"" MRC analysts found.""Add it all up, and the media coverage of the past three months is more lopsided than that of any presidential election in the modern media age,"" the report reads.""So if Donald Trump regains the White House next week, the media’s campaign against him will have accomplished nothing, except the further erosion of their own reputations.""The MRC findings come shortly after a Gallup study revealed that trust remains both historically and consistently low in the media. Only 31% of those polled expressed a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" of faith in the media to report news properly.""For the third consecutive year, more U.S. adults have no trust at all in the media (36%) than trust it a great deal or fair amount.

He announced plans to rescind his retirement in a letter to the White House on Friday.""A successor has not been confirmed, and I have therefore decided to remain on active status and carry out the full duties and obligations of the office,"" Marbley wrote in the letter.Senior status is available to judges over the age of 65 who have completed at least 15 years on the federal bench.Marbley's decision comes as the Biden administration is scrambling to appoint as many judges as possible before the Trump administration takes power in January.There are currently 47 vacant seats in the federal judiciary, and there are 19 more justices who have announced plans to retire. Marbley was among the latter group.The Biden administration has candidates to fill 28 of those seats, if their confirmation processes can be completed in time.As of September, the Biden administration was barely out-pacing the number of judges confirmed by Trump in his first term. Trump had appointed 204 federal judges by Sep. 5, 2020, while Biden had appointed 205 by the same point in his term.Both Biden and Trump have put a renewed emphasis on the federal judiciary, each focusing on quickly facilitating as many appointments as they could during their terms. Their appointments during one term have rivaled those of their predecessors, who had double the time to confirm them.",12-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-judge-ohio-rescinds-retirement-after-trump-victory-biden-yet-nominate-successor
"'Pathetic': Top 10 media meltdowns following Trump's election win, from on-air tears to claims of 'misogyny'","President-elect Donald Trump’s resounding victory on Tuesday led to widespread panic among media anchors and pundits, with many breaking down into tearful monologues and aggrieved rants against American voters. Jimmy Kimmel fights back tears after Trump victoryLate night host Jimmy Kimmel struggled to hold back tears on Wednesday, describing the election as a ""terrible night"" for a variety of voting blocks, including women, children, immigrants, the elderly and the middle-class. ""It was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him and guess what? It was a terrible night for everyone who voted for him too, you just don’t realize it yet,"" he said. CBS News reporter chokes up in sit down with Stephen ColbertKimmel was not the only one with tears in his eyes following Election Day. CBS News’ John Dickerson choked up during a post-election appearance on the ""Late Show,"" telling host Stephen Colbert he would struggle not to think about his boys when describing the results to young Americans. He suggested that young people in the United States can get on one of two hypothetical buses that will take them to a destination they believe is meaningful. The first bus, Dickerson said, has people that just want to be seen and be given an opportunity. ""Then there are other people on the bus engaged in the same journey who are there absolutely just for themselves, to get power, to give themselves just more riches and more control over things,"" he added. Colbert claims majority of voters ‘don’t care’ about democracy""Hey there, how are you doing? If you watch this show regularly, I’m guessing you’re not doing great. Yeah, me neither,"" Colbert began his show Wednesday night.Later in his monologue, the liberal comedian shamed the majority of Americans who backed Trump in the election.""I wish, you wish, so many of us wish this hadn't happen, but that's not for us to decide. This is a democracy.. And in this democracy, the majority has spoken, and they said they don’t care that much about democracy,"" Colbert told his far-left audience. MSNBC host says Americans decided to ‘F around and find out’Following the election, MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle said Americans were gambling with the country’s future by choosing Trump as their next president. During ""The 11th Hour,"" Ruhle said Americans have let ""misinformation"" become the new accepted form of ""information,"" name-dropping Elon Musk and claiming the X owner bought the platform ""exclusively to become a propaganda machine.""She also touted the country’s ""great economic recovery,"" but lamented voters for simply not feeling the ""vibes.""""What will the future hold now that America has just decided that we’re going to F around and find out?,"" Ruhle asked. ‘The View’ calls Trump victory ‘pathetic’ and ‘disturbing’The women of ABC’s ""The View"" were unsurprisingly shocked and agitated after Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 Presidential Election.""It’s pathetic,"" Joy Behar said. ""There are no checks and balances. A completely intelligent, qualified woman lost to a guy who was simulating sex with a microphone. I mean, come on, America.""Co-Host Sunny Hostin felt ""profoundly disturbed by the results,"" and said she feared for the work-class, the elderly and even her own daughter—who she claimed, ""now has less rights than I have.""She also hypothesized that the election was a ""a referendum on cultural resentment"" and expressed concern that Trump would set up ""internment camps.""On Thursday, Hostin would go on to insist that ""sexism and misogyny"" were to blame for Trump winning the Latino vote in a Texas county that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Claire McCaskill cries on-air while looking back at Harris’ candidacyMSNBC analyst and former Democratic senator Claire McCaskill cried after watching Vice President Kamala Harris' concession speech on Wednesday.""I’m so proud of her,"" she said. ""I don’t think people realize how hard it is to get to where she was.""Joy Reid casts blame for Trump win on White womenOn MSNBC, Joy Reid essentially blamed White women for Harris’ North Carolina loss.""Black voters came through for Kamala Harris, White women voters did not. That is what appears happened in that state,"" Reid told viewers.""This will be the second opportunity that White women in this country have had to change the way that they interact with the patriarchy,"" she continued. ""If people aren’t receptive to it, and if people vote more party line, or more on race than on gender, and on protecting their gender, there’s really not much more that you can do.""Van Jones gives tearful monologue on people ‘hurting’ after Harris defeatCNN’s Van Jones got emotional Tuesday night thinking about people who were ""hurting"" because of the results. ""I’m thinking about the people who are not a part of anybody’s elite who are hurting tonight. There are African-American women who know a little bit about being talked down to, who know a little bit about having their economic dreams crushed, who try to dream a big dream over the past couple of months, and tonight they’re trading in a lot of hope for a lot of hurt,"" Jones said.""They were hoping that maybe, this time, this time, one of their own could be seen as worthy,"" Jones continued. ""Once again they’re facing rejection."" Jones then told CNN viewers that Black women aren’t the only people ""hurting.""""If you’re a parent of a trans kid, your child’s face was used as a springboard to power for somebody. That doesn’t feel good,"" Jones said.CNN's Acosta on Latino Trump supporters: 'Why would they do this to themselves?'CNN host Jim Acosta lectured Latino Trump supporters for voting ""against their own self-interests"" by backing President-elect Donald Trump in the 2024 election.""A lot of folks are wondering why would Latinos vote for Donald Trump if that means he might deport abuela, he might deport members of their household,"" he said. Acosta later repeatedly questioned Luis Figueroa, the vice chair of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly on if he wanted to see illegal immigrants ""rounded up and put in camps.""""Isn’t that what you voted for?,"" he asked. Al Sharpton labels Black voters sexist, blames loss on misogynyDuring two separate segments, MSNBC host Al Sharpton claimed that misogyny and racism among voters may have cost Harris the election. ""Some of the most misogynist things I’ve heard going on during this get out the vote tour came from Black men!"" he said.The previous morning, Sharpton insisted that there is still a lot of racism and gender bias in the United States. ""I think for us to ignore that and not try to bring that front and center so we can heal that would mean that we would end up in the same place. Kamala Harris is a woman of color in an interracial marriage, running as a woman to be the head of state. That is something that a lot of Americans are not ready to deal with,"" he said.

"Biden pushes to finalize more student debt relief before end of term, including for 'future borrowers'","President Biden's Department of Education is trying to push through a new federal rule during the final weeks before President-elect Trump takes over to provide additional student loan forgiveness for 8 million borrowers who face financial hardships. If finalized, the new rule would authorize student debt forgiveness on a one-time basis for people who the department considers to have at least an 80% chance of defaulting on loans based on a ""predictive assessment using existing borrower data.""The rule would also allow people, including potential ""future borrowers,"" to apply for relief that will be awarded based on ""a holistic assessment of the borrower’s hardship.""Negotiated rulemaking for higher education between 2023 and 2024 began last year, and this latest rule was discussed in committee as early as November 2023. However, the rule was not proposed until Oct. 31 and is working its way through a public notice and comment period expected to end Dec. 2.""For far too long, our broken student loan system has made it too hard for borrowers experiencing heartbreaking and financially devastating hardships to access relief, and it’s not right,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""The rules proposed by the Biden-Harris administration today would provide hope to millions of struggling Americans whose challenges may make them eligible for student debt relief.""While a handful of Biden's previous attempts to wipe out student debt have been struck down as an overreach of power by the courts, and despite federal rulemaking typically taking anywhere from a few months to a few years to be completed, the Biden administration has not been dissuaded from initiating additional attempts to eliminate Americans' student loan debt during its final weeks.In 2023, Biden announced his administration's greatest effort to wipe out student debt for millions of borrowers through a new ""SAVE"" plan that sought to reduce borrowers' debt obligations based on their economic circumstances. However, the effort was shot down by the Supreme Court after it was determined Biden did not have authority under a 2003 federal law to unilaterally forgive hundreds of billions of dollars in student debt.In addition to the SAVE program, other efforts by the Biden administration to cancel student debt relief remain tied up in the courts.President-elect Trump has described Biden's attempts to wipe out debt for student borrowers ""a total catastrophe.""""They didn't even come close to getting student loans,"" Trump said during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris in September, referring to the courts shooting down Biden's student debt forgiveness attempts. ""They taunted young people and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved.""The White House did not respond with an on-the-record comment when reached by Fox News Digital.

Jon Stewart rages at pollsters for inaccurate predictions amid Trump victory: 'You don't know s--- about s---',"Amid President-elect Donald Trump’s victory, ""The Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart scorched media and poll analysts for being wrong not only in this election, but across recent decades.After what was frequently considered a dead heat election, Trump won a commanding victory over Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday. Late on election night, Stewart noted that while the results were still coming in, pollsters already appeared to be some of this election’s biggest losers.""I do want to very quickly send a quick message to all the pollsters, the election pollsters. Bl-- me,"" the talk show host said. ""I don’t ever want to [bleep] from you again. I don’t ever want to hear, ‘We’ve corrected the overcorrection.’ You don’t know s--- about s--- and I don’t care for it.""He proceeded to mock pollsters again with a silly voice saying, ""’We’ll figure it out next time — oh, we were in the margin of-' B--- me!""Showing visible frustration and then composing himself, Stewart suggested that, ""We’re going to come out of this election we are going to make all kinds of pronouncements about what this country is and what this world is, and the truth is, we are not really going to know s---."" ""I just want to point out, just as a matter of perspective, that the lessons that our pundits take away from these results that they will pronounce with certainty will be wrong, and we have to remember that,"" he said, before reviewing commentary from past election cycles. Stewart recalled how ABC News host George Stephanopoulos offered glowing praise after Barack Obama’s election victory in 2008, and showed footage of the host arguing this would be ""the first election of the future, really, and I think we are moving towards a post-racial America.""""Yeah, that lasted a day!"" Stewart said. He then recalled how in 2012, after President Obama won reelection, it was believed that the Republicans needed to demonstrate respect for Hispanic voters.Stewart then played footage of Trump saying that some illegal immigrants from Mexico were rapists and bringing drugs into the country.""Which apparently was the winning message!"" Stewart replied, appearing to refer to Hispanic voters supporting Trump in this election.Stewart then played footage of multiple commentators talking about how the country would likely favor a shift toward younger leadership.""Need I say it?"" Stewart said before showing footage of Biden accepting the Democratic Party’s nomination.The talk show host played footage of NBC/MSNBC analyst John Heilemann saying, after Jan. 6, 2021, ""When Trump leaves office on Wednesday morning, he will leave Washington a pariah,"" and then MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell declaring, ""Donald Trump will never be allowed to set foot in the Capitol again. Never.""""My point is this…"" Stewart said before cursing so long he was bleeped on his network for about three seconds.After reassuring listeners that this would not be the end, he played footage of a voter saying, ""I just want this nightmare to be over. I do have children, and I have a cat, and I will be watching with my Xanax and my bottle of sauvignon blanc.""",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/jon-stewart-rages-pollsters-inaccurate-predictions-amid-trump-victory-you-dont-know-s-about-s

Gavin Newsom responded for the first time to President-elect Trump’s victory over Vice President Harris in the 2024 presidential election, saying he’ll work with Trump but not without issuing a warning.Newsom shared his remarks on social media Wednesday, expressing that a second Trump presidency is ""not the outcome we wanted,"" but the ""fight for freedom and opportunity endures."""".@KamalaHarris set out to fight to defend our fundamental freedoms and build a country that works for everyone. She stood up for working families, decency, and opportunity,"" Newsom wrote. ""California will seek to work with the incoming president – but let there be no mistake, we intend to stand with states across our nation to defend our Constitution and uphold the rule of law.""He continued: ""Federalism is the cornerstone of our democracy.

Ahead of the vote, Newsom said: ""Prop 36 takes us back to the 1980s, mass incarceration — it promotes a promise that can’t be delivered."" Voters disagreed as crime has spiraled in California in recent years, most notably in 2021 and 2022, when smash-and-grab crimes hit a fever pitch in the state.

'Painstaking process': Pa. county gives update on probe of suspicious batch of voter forms,"The chair of a Pennsylvania county election board updated voters Monday on the status of 2,500 voter registration and mail-in ballot applications that had been flagged last month as potentially fraudulent and prompted a county and statewide investigation in the crucial swing state.Speaking at a press conference, Lancaster County Commissioner Ray D’Agostino said that of the 2,500 registration and mail-in ballot applications that had been flagged as suspicious, a 57% majority had been confirmed as valid, and 17% were confirmed to be fraudulent, he said. The remaining 26% of voter registration applications and mail-in ballot applications are either incomplete or unverified, he said, and remain under investigation.""Those other two buckets are going to change, quite frankly, based on the continuing investigation,"" D’Agostino said of the remaining applications, noting that the process of vetting the applications is a ""painstaking process.""Officials said the applications were marked as suspicious ""during the staff's normal process to review and enter applications into [a Pennsylvania database]"" and law enforcement was alerted.They noted that the forms in question either had false names, duplicative handwriting or unverifiable or incorrect identifying information. Both the local District Attorney’s Office and the Lancaster County Board of Elections have since been working to review and vet the applications. County election officials also immediately notified the Pennsylvania Department of State and the state attorney general’s office last month for further investigation.D’Agostino declined to comment further on the status of those investigations Monday, though he told reporters that any individuals whose applications were potentially impacted as a result of the probe have been notified by the county. The applications in question are not limited to a single party, and were collected across various spots across Lancaster County last month. ""I can't give any more information"" at this point, D’Agostino said Monday of the investigation, adding that county and state officials are ""continuing to investigate"" and take the matter ""very seriously.""The Pennsylvania Department of State confirmed its involvement in the probe late last month to Fox News Digital. It also applauded Lancaster County ""for their diligent work in spotting this potential fraud and bringing it to the attention of law enforcement.""""As the county’s efforts show, multiple safeguards exist to ensure the integrity of our elections, and Pennsylvanians can have confidence that this November’s election will be safe, secure, free, and fair,"" the office told Fox News.The update in Lancaster Monday comes just days after officials in Pennsylvania's Monroe County said they are also investigating a much smaller pool of voter registration and mail-in ballot applications that had been set aside as potentially fraudulent.These applications, believed to total around 30, were spotted by county board of election officials and referred to the district attorney's office for further investigation.Pennsylvania Attorney General Michelle Henry also sought to reassure voters in the Keystone State last week, noting in a press release Thursday that her office has been working with respective counties on the apparent attempts to submit fraudulent ballots and investigate any organizations that may be responsible. ""While we will not be divulging sensitive information about these investigations, we want to clarify that the investigations regard voter registration forms, not ballots,"" Henry said. ""These attempts have been thwarted by the safeguards in place in Pennsylvania.""She added: ""The investigations are ongoing, and offenders who perpetrated acts of fraud will be held accountable under the law.""",4-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/painstaking-process-pa-county-gives-update-probe-suspicious-batch-voter-forms
Nancy Pelosi fact-checked by Washington Post for claim 'fewer' migrants crossed the border under Biden,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was fact-checked on Wednesday by The Washington Post for claiming that fewer migrants came into the U.S. under President Biden than under President-elect Trump's first term. ""I don’t think we were clear enough by saying fewer people came in under President Joe Biden than came under Donald Trump,"" Pelosi told The New York Times during a recent interview. ""It’s clarity of the message, and if that’s what [Sen.] Bernie’s [Sanders] talking about, and that’s what [Sen.] Joe Manchin’s talking about, we weren’t clear in our message as to what things are, then I agree with that.""The Washington Post published a fact-check on the claim on Wednesday, and noted that it was ""documented fact"" that ""at least four times as many migrants entered the United States under Biden than under Trump.""An aide told the outlet that Pelsoi was referring to deportations during the interview and pointed to numbers in a Reuters report, according to the Post. ""It showed that in fiscal year 2024, Biden was on pace to exceed the number of deportations of any single year under Trump. But the article did not say that deportations under Biden would be higher than they were under Trump — far from it. Through four years, Biden almost certainly will have fewer deportations than Trump, according to the Reuters count,"" the Post's report read. The outlet reported that Pelosi's claim ""veers even more off course"" when they dig deeper into the numbers and said the former House speaker earned ""Four Pinocchio's.""   During the same New York Times interview, Pelosi suggested Vice President Kamala Harris might have won if Biden dropped out sooner.""Had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race. Kamala, I think, still would have won, but she may have been stronger, having taken her case to the public sooner,"" she told the Times.MSNBC host Symone Sanders Townsend called out Pelosi over the weekend for the role she played in President Biden exiting the presidential race.""I’m going to say it if she ain’t going to say it — Nancy Pelosi, everybody talks about how the speaker emerita, you know, she’s so strategic, she can count, she did all of that when she was the speaker in Congress, but my question is: Where is your calculator now?""

"Election polling could be underestimating Kamala Harris, Democrats in key states, CNN data reporter warns","CNN data reporter Harry Enten warned on Tuesday that election polling could be underestimating Vice President Kamala Harris rather than former President Trump, who has been historically underestimated in election polling in previous cycles.""If the polls are going to underestimate Donald Trump, once again, that would be historically unprecedented,"" Enten said. ""What normally happens is the pollsters catch on, ‘Hey, we‘re underestimating, we‘re not taking into account some part of the electorate.’ They make adjustments, and I think that helps to explain why we have never seen that the same party has been underestimated three times in a row in presidential elections, at least in the last 52 years.""CNN's John Berman also asked Enten about the 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats exceeded expectations, and what they might indicate about the polls in key swing states.""What do we see in 2022 in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin? Well, it turns out that the average poll in those states actually underestimated Democrats by four points. It underestimated Democrats by four points. And I want to apply that to the electoral map because [if] it turns out that the polls underestimated the Democrats like they did in 2022, well Kamala Harris wins a sweep,"" Enten said. ""I think a lot of folks are sort of counting in that Donald Trump will in fact be underestimated by the polls. But when I’m looking at the evidence, I think you got to hold on a second. Maybe that‘ll happen. Maybe it will happen. But I think that there are folks who are underestimating the idea that maybe Kamala Harris will be underestimated by the polls,"" Enten concluded.Enten has also warned that polling has underestimated the former president in the past, and while he was trailing Harris earlier in the cycle, the race for the White House in key swing states is effectively tied.Polling guru Nate Silver similarly warned in August that Trump has been underestimated in the last two elections.In early October, Enten said if the polls are off like they were in 2020, Trump would win in a ""blowout.""""What happens then? Well, then Donald Trump wins the election in a blowout with 312 electoral votes because he carries all these Great Lake battleground states plus Nevada, plus the other states he was leading in — Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia,"" he said at the time.",29-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/election-polling-could-underestimating-kamala-harris-democrats-key-states-cnn-data-reporter-warns

Georgia absentee ballot ruling provides legal victory for RNC on eve of election,"The Georgia Supreme Court ruled Monday that absentee ballots that were mailed late to voters in Cobb County will only be counted if they arrive back to election officials by Election Day, sparking GOP leadership to take a victory lap. ""HUGE election integrity victory in Georgia. Democrat-run Cobb County wanted to accept 3,000 absentee ballots AFTER the Election Day deadline. We took this case to the Georgia Supreme Court,"" RNC chair Michael Whatley posted to X on Monday. ""We just got word that we WON the case. Election Day is Election Day – not the week after. We will keep fighting, keep winning, and keep sharing updates,"" he added. Last week, it was revealed that about 3,000 absentee ballots were mailed late to voters in Cobb County, with just days to spare ahead of Election Day. A county judge ruled on Nov. 1 that the Cobb County Board of Elections could count the ballots if they arrived by 5 p.m. Nov. 8, and were postmarked by 7 p.m. Nov. 5.On Monday, the state's Supreme Court granted an emergency motion ruling that ballots will only be counted if they are received by 7 p.m. Tuesday. ""Consistent with OCGA § 21-2-386, the Cobb County Board of Elections and Registration (the ‘Board’) may count only those absentee ballots received by the statutory deadline of 7:00 p.m. on Election Day, November 5, 2024."" the order reads. The ruling comes after the ACLU, ACLU of Georgia, and Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit last week regarding roughly 3,000 voters in Cobb County who did not receive absentee ballots. A Superior Court judge subsequently ordered election officials to overnight mail the delayed absentee ballots, and ruled that the ballots should be counted if they are received by Nov. 8. The ACLU lamented the state Supreme Court ruling on Monday, and urged ""all affected voters to prioritize voting in person on Election Day, November 5, 2024, if at all possible.""""This afternoon, the Georgia Supreme Court denied relief for Cobb County voters who requested absentee ballots on time but did not receive them on time due to the county’s failure to mail them promptly. The lower court had ruled that an extension of the absentee receipt deadline was necessary in order to protect these voters’ constitutional right to vote, but the Georgia Supreme Court stayed that ruling, removing the relief that the lower court had ordered.

Schumer now pleads for bi-partisanship having promised to railroad Democrat agenda through,"With Republicans sweeping to a red trifecta in last week’s elections, stunningly capturing the White House and majorities in the House and Senate, Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is cutting a different tone, compared to his pre-election hype where he posited a Democrat win in the Senate and then potentially getting rid of the filibuster, among other radical proposals. Ending the filibuster rule – which requires 60 votes to pass bills – would have made it easier for Democrats to supercharge their agenda and essentially railroad any Republican opposition. Schumer and the Democrats tried to kill the filibuster in 2022 when they had 50 votes – the vice president could have broken the tie – but Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema refused to toe the Democratic party line. They eventually became Independents.With Manchin and Sinema leaving the Senate, Schumer was confident of having at least 50 Senate seats after this year’s election with a then-potential Vice President Walz breaking the tie on a filibuster vote. ""We got it up to 48, but, of course, Sinema and Manchin voted no; that’s why we couldn’t change the rules. Well, they’re both gone,"" Schumer told reporters on the Tuesday during the week of the Democratic convention, according to NBC News.""Ruben Gallego is for it, and we have 51. So, even losing Manchin, we still have 50.""The result would have essentially meant one-party rule in the Senate, with Schumer also toying with expanding voting rights nationwide by passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. He also discussed a potential rule change to codify abortion rights in federal law, a party priority after Roe v. Wade was overturned, which would have faced staunch Republican opposition and lacking a path to 60 Senate votes.Schumer also posited reforming the Supreme Court by slapping 18-year term limits on justices and touted reversing the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling, which determined that presidents are immune from prosecution for some ""official acts.""He has previously announced his intention to move legislation that would expand the Supreme Court from nine to 13 members.But this week, he went to the floor of the Senate to tell Republicans to essentially go easy on their legislative colleagues on the other side of the aisle, since Republicans will have a 53-to-47 majority. ""To my Republican colleagues, I offer a word of caution in good faith,"" Schumer said. ""Take care not to misread the will of the people, and do not abandon the need for bipartisanship. After winning an election, the temptation may be to go to the extreme. We’ve seen that happen over the decades, and it has consistently backfired on the party in power.""""So, instead of going to the extremes, I remind my colleagues that this body is most effective when it’s bipartisan. If we want the next four years in the Senate to be as productive as the last four, the only way that will happen is through bipartisan cooperation.""Schumer’s about face wasn’t lost on Byron York, chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner and a Fox News contributor.""The short version of that is: Please don’t do to us what we were going to do to you,"" York writes in the Washington Examiner. ""Schumer is obviously concerned that Republicans might embrace a scheme to eliminate the filibuster and pass all sorts of consequential legislation with no Democratic input at all. That wouldn’t be bipartisan!""""Fortunately for Schumer, Republicans have been more principled than Democrats when it comes to the legislative filibuster, and to the filibuster in general. Republicans realize that even though they will have the majority for the next two years, they might be back in the minority at any time after that. So Schumer will not get it good and hard the way he planned to give it to Republicans.""York writes that Schumer’s ""brand of hypocrisy is particularly egregious"" since he was advocating changing Senate rules on a partisan basis to eliminate the minority party’s ability to demand a higher standard of approval for controversial legislation, as opposed to advocating to get a particular bill across the line. ""He was. And then, when Schumer’s party loses, he instantly turns around and becomes Mr. Bipartisanship. For that, there should be a word that goes beyond mere hypocrisy.""Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., will replace Schumer as Majority Leader and is planning to make ushering in President-elect Trump's immigration agenda the first item on his to-do list when he succeeds. He has not indicated that he intended to vote on the filibuster rule.He said repairing the economy is also near the top of his list. As crucial elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 passed by Trump are set to expire in 2025, Thune said Republicans will take action through the budget reconciliation process to renew them.The trifecta will make Trump's agenda easier to pursue without opposition from a Democratic majority. Republicans held a governing trifecta from 2017 to 2019. The GOP achieved much of their agenda, including sweeping tax reform and confirming justices to achieve a conservative majority in the Supreme Court.But Thune said he would protect the filibuster rule, even if it stands in the way of the Trump agenda it hopes to advance.",16-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schumer-now-pleads-bi-partisanship-having-promised-railroad-democrat-agenda-through
Black Lives Matter activist to vote for Donald Trump: 'I definitely would not be supporting Kamala Harris',"A Black Lives Matter activist on the eve of Election Day slammed Vice President Kamala Harris and said that he plans to vote for former President Trump.""Kamala Harris would use anything to her advantage. I definitely would not be supporting Kamala Harris. If she ever got anywhere close to power, it would be a disaster for this country,"" said co-founder of Black Lives Matter [BLM] Rhode Island Mark Fisher in an interview with The New York Post published on Monday.Three years ago, Fisher led the BLM Rhode Island’s effort to demand Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse resign or sever ties with an all-White and exclusive Newport Beach club.Fisher explained further to the New York Post that historically, the Democratic Party has been the party Black people overwhelmingly voted for, yet, never ""got anything in return."" He also cited ""abysmal"" poverty and crime and a ""failing"" education system in Black communities.The ""lifelong Democrat"" voted for President Biden in 2020, a decision he ""regrets.""""For so long, we've just been blindly loyal to the Democrat Party – for no reason,"" Fisher told The New York Post.""They have given us no reason to have such loyalty – to maintain such loyalty – to them,"" he added.Fisher first endorsed the GOP presidential nominee in November 2023 and told Fox News then that ""the Democratic Party is not for us.""The national BLM organization and the BLM Rhode Island PAC have distanced themselves from Fisher, dismissing him as an ""imposter"" activist and calling his endorsement ""a publicity stunt."" Fisher clarified that he is the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Rhode Island, an organization separate from the BLM Rhode Island PAC.Furthermore, the national BLM organization and the BLM Rhode Island PAC clarified that they do not support Trump and that anyone can start a BLM chapter.The left-wing organization denounced Harris being chosen as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and called for the Democratic National Convention to hold a primary process to select a candidate.Fisher currently leads a Maryland-based organization called ""BLM INCORPORATED.""According to BLM INCORPORATED's website, the organization seeks to create opportunities for ""entrepreneurship education"" and ""financial empowerment"" in the Black community.They recently launched a Black Legacy & Resource Library and Business & Innovation Center in Maryland, an effort they dubbed a ""Black Lives Matter educational centerpiece.""",5-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/media/black-lives-matter-activist-vote-donald-trump-i-definitely-would-not-supporting-kamala-harris
Biden targeted in GOP resolution condemning 'garbage' remark about Trump supporters,"President Biden is getting hit with a resolution in Congress condemning his ""garbage"" remarks while discussing former President Donald Trump’s supporters earlier this week.""President Biden must be condemned for calling millions of Americans who support Donald Trump garbage,"" Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., who is introducing the measure later this week, told Fox News Digital.He linked it to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s infamous quip that half of Trump supporters were a ""basket of deplorables"" during her doomed 2016 presidential bid. ""First, Democrats called half the country deplorables. Now, they are doubling down, calling us garbage. Democrats’ disrespect for half the country’s views and opinions is exactly what is wrong with the leadership of extreme far-left liberals,"" Rose said.Republicans have been hammering Biden – and by extension 2024 Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris – over the remarks, even forcing top Democrats to distance themselves from the controversial comment.The White House has denied that the president called Trump supporters ""garbage,"" and interpretations of what the 81-year-old leader said have been hotly debated.Biden was asked about Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden during a virtual call with Voto Latino. Democrats had accused Republicans of racist rhetoric during the event, particularly one of comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s jokes referring to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage.""He responded by saying, ""Donald Trump has no character. He doesn't give a damn about the Latino community. He's a failed businessman. He only cares about the billionaire friends that he has and accumulating wealth for those at the top.""""And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.' Well, let me tell you something…in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.  It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been,"" Biden said.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisted Wednesday that he was referring to Hinchcliffe’s joke.""He does not view Trump supporters or anybody who supports Trump as garbage. That is not what he views,"" she said.Biden himself posted a similar explanation on X earlier this week.""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation,"" the post said.However, that has done little to stem the Republican backlash, particularly with Election Day less than a week away.Trump arrived at his Wednesday campaign stop in Wisconsin in a garbage truck and wore a high-visibility vest throughout his rally.Vivek Ramaswamy, one of his surrogates, posted a video of himself on the job with sanitation workers.Harris distanced herself from the comments Wednesday morning, telling reporters, ""I think that, first of all, he clarified his comments. But let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.""Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who is running in one of the most closely watched Senate races in the country, went even further.""In terms of what President Biden said yesterday, he shouldn’t have said it. I mean, it’s inappropriate. And, for me, I just think that kind of talk is the last thing we need in our politics,"" Slotkin told Michigan radio station WWJ Newsradio.Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on Rose’s resolution.",31-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-targeted-gop-resolution-condemning-garbage-remark-about-trump-supporters
"Trump administration could lead to budget cuts, leadership shakeup at UN","A Donald Trump presidency is sure to have reverberations at the United Nations (U.N.), and first on the chopping block could be its funding. The U.N. currently relies on the U.S. for about a third of its budget. President Biden increased U.S. financial contributions to the U.N., boosting it from $11.6 billion in 2020 to $18.1 billion in 2022. This gives a new administration wiggle room to withhold funds to the U.N. if its global interests do not align with the U.S.', a notion some Republicans have already pushed for. The U.S. gave about three times as much that year as the next-highest contributors, Germany at $6.8 billion and Japan at $2.7 billion. ""They will have to recalibrate now very much again in the Trump administration that will, I believe, be much more attentive, engaged and monitoring of the U.N.,"" predicted Hugh Dugan, a longtime member of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. ""There are teams there that have been sleepwalking the last few years without U.S. pressure on accountability, efficiency and effectiveness.""Trump will be in office when the international body elects its next secretary general in 2026, and the U.S. will have veto power over any candidate. ""Over the next year and a half, it's going to make an effort to look more managerially competent to avoid some of the stern green eyes seated across here – attention that Elon Musk and the Trump team will want to bring to the consideration of the secretary general selection.""Trump would also likely once again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords and the U.N. Global Compact on Migration. The U.N. particularly relies on the U.S. for global aid programs. In 2022, it provided half of all contributions to the World Food Programme, and about a third of all contributions to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the International Organization for Migration.""There's no doubt the U.N. is frightened and horrified,"" of Trump taking office, said Hillel Neuer, executive director of U.N. Watch. ""We're going to see budget cuts,"" he said. ""The most memorable being UNRWA.""Trump cut funding to the organization that distributes aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Biden led the U.S. in reinstating that aid and earmarking $1 billion for UNRWA – before freezing that aid when it was revealed that some employees had links to Hamas. ""I would say the Human Rights Office, which is based in Geneva, the U.N. Human Rights Council, America gives voluntary funds to that bureaucracy. I could see that being cut,"" Neuer said. Some wonder whether Trump and a Republican-led Congress might try to withdraw the U.S. from the U.N. entirely. The GOP-controlled House passed a spending bill in June that would eliminate funding for the U.N.’s regular budget.However, despite an adversarial tone toward global institutions, Trump is not expected to stop dealing with the U.N. altogether. In his first administration, he enjoyed a good relationship with Secretary General António Guterres, inviting him to the White House, and seemed to enjoy his yearly address to the General Assembly and the pageantry of world leaders traipsing through the New York City headquarters. ""He engaged personally up there quite a lot. And during the opening of the General Assembly, he brought the White House up there, frankly, and lived up there for that week every year and operated. He recognizes the value of the organization, if just as a meeting place,"" said Dugan.Trump could also seek to push candidates for leadership over agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme that challenge U.N. orthodoxy and encourage American employment across the agency to counter China’s growing influence. China doubled the number of its nationals employed at the U.N. to nearly 15,000 from 2009 to 2021. ""This was very much in the mind of the Trump administration when I worked in the White House that China's growing its influence in subtle and not so subtle ways throughout the organization, affording it a globalized platform of legitimacy that they're ready and willing to exploit to their national ends,"" said Dugan. ""The U.S. has to study the terrain of the organization better and identify, in particular, the key posts and influential offices that we should show up with our best talent and make sure that we are effective. The Chinese have been doing that really well.""Additionally, though the Biden administration did buck a number of U.N. resolutions that targeted Israel, he was naturally more supportive of international organizations as a whole.

Trump hating NY Attorney General Letitia James vows war with president-elect in divisive news conference,"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, who've spent years prosecuting and disparaging Donald Trump, vowed to fight back against any potential ""revenge or retribution"" that may be coming their way now that President-elect Trump will be returning to the White House.Hochul offered congratulations to Trump during a press conference on Wednesday while also commending his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris and running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for a ""hard-fought campaign that really lifted up so many issues that matter to Americans.""She acknowledged that the results may not have been what many had hoped for but reassured her constituents that New York has overcome hard times before.""That's why I have the confidence in my team and all those we work closely with that we will get through the uncertainty of a new administration in Washington because, as I said, we've done this before,"" Hochul said. ""I want to be very clear that while we honor the results of this election and will work with anyone who wants to be a partner in achieving the goals of our administration in our state, that does not mean we'll accept an agenda from Washington that strips away the rights that New Yorkers have long enjoyed.""The governor reminded the public that New York is the birthplace of the women’s rights movement, the environmental justice movement, the LGBTQ rights movement and the American labor movement, saying the state will continue to be a ""bastion"" of freedom and the rule of law.She also announced the establishment of the Empire State Freedom Initiative, which will focus on areas Hochul and other state officials believe could face threats from the Trump administration. She said the initiative will offer protections for reproduction rights, civil rights, immigration, gun safety, labor rights, LGBTQ rights and environmental justice.""Our team will do whatever we have to do to identify any possible threats to these rights that we hold dear in the state of New York and protect New Yorkers,"" Hochul said. ""This will include legislation, rulemaking, appropriations and partnerships with our congressional delegation and including the Biden administration at this time.""She called on Trump to support New York's ongoing efforts to obtain funding for major critical infrastructure with the MTA and to back economic development projects like those funded by the Chips and Science Act.""I will work with him or anybody, regardless of party, on these kind of efforts that I know will benefit the state of New York,"" Hochul said. ""However, if you try to harm New Yorkers or rollback their rights, I will fight you every step of the way. New Yorkers are resilient. We fought the first time around, and we'll fight again.""James also congratulated Trump on his win, but not without spite.She told the people of New York that she and other state officials would work with Trump and his administration ""if possible"" but without compromising the state’s integrity or principles.""We did not expect this result, but we are prepared to respond to this result. And my office has been preparing for several months because we've been here before,"" James said. ""We faced this challenge before, and we used the rule of law to fight back. And we are prepared to fight back once again because, as the attorney general of this great state, it is my job to protect and defend the rights of New Yorkers and the rule of law. And I will not shrink from that responsibility.""Between 2019 and 2021, James said, her office took nearly 100 legal actions against Trump’s previous administration, including when he attempted to put a cap on state and local taxes and tried to eliminate funds and grants for law enforcement officials in New York.James said her office also fought to protect the Affordable Care Act, prevent a question about citizenship from being on the census, and put a stop to the dismantling of the U.S. Postal Service, among other things.She also said she knows the Trump administration’s playbook and has a contingency plan in place to respond to any attack on the state.""We're ready to respond to any attempts to cut or eliminate any funding to the great state of New York, as the governor outlined,"" James said. ""So, despite what has happened on the national stage, we will continue to stand tall in the face of injustice, revenge or retribution.""""This is not the time to be fearful, New York, but faithful and steadfast, knowing that I, as the attorney general, along with my entire team, we are guardians of the law, and we are prepared, my friends, to fight back,"" she added.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the matter.",6-Nov-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hating-ny-ag-gov-vow-legal-fight-against-trump-threat-counter-any-payback
"Oklahoma schools chief bills Kamala Harris $474M for education costs, citing illegal immigration","Oklahoma's top elected education official sent a ""demand letter"" to Vice President Kamala Harris that essentially served as an invoice for what the illegal immigration crisis under her tenure overseeing the border has cost Sooner State schools.""As the statewide elected Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Oklahoma and the Executive Officer of the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE), it is my duty to ensure that the resources allocated to our public schools are counted for and used in the most effective manner possible for the benefit of Oklahoma students’ education,"" Ryan Walters wrote to Harris.In August, Walters tasked the department to work with school districts to calculate the financial impact borne by taxpayers on illegal immigrant minors. That analysis resulted in an estimate of $474.9 million, which he demanded of Harris in the letter.""This demand amount is, by necessity, an estimate because only your administration knows the true number of illegal immigrants crossing this nation’s borders and the actual costs of illegal immigration,"" he said, calling for Harris to conduct a potentially more accurate accounting of the costs incurred by Oklahoma schools.""Under your supervision, the costs in education due to illegal immigration have risen astronomically. Your failed oversight and efforts are a direct cause of the current crises Oklahoma and other states now face. Oklahoma taxpayers, schools, teachers, and parents should not bear the burden of your failings. They deserve better,"" Walters said.In a Tuesday interview, Walters said the border crisis is ""crippling"" Oklahoma schools, and that paying for these minors' education is the ""largest unfunded mandate in the country.""He said Oklahoma has been the first state to both calculate the education costs of the border crisis and to actually bill the Biden-Harris administration for the fiscal disparity.In August, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order directing hospitals to collect cost information in a similar fashion, for patients ""not lawfully present in the United States.""""Since she's been the border czar, she's failed our country,"" Walters said. ""Open borders has had an impact on every aspect of society, but it has overrun our schools, decimated our families. And it is absolutely time to hold them accountable for that.""Walters said he invites other states to follow suit and calculate the real costs of illegal immigration, to show the true effects of the crisis on the country.Harris' office did not respond to a request for comment.When asked if he expects a response or a remittance, Walters said the administration has long been ""unresponsive to the needs of all Americans.""""I know that they've magically pretended like they've cared about it here in the last 60 days of their campaign.

The personal memoir gives readers a rare look inside her life, starting with the moment she set foot on American soil as a 26-year-old and on through the assassination attempt on her husband, former President Donald J. Trump, this past summer in Butler, Pennsylvania. Whether she's enjoying personal success or dealing with political chaos, whether she's celebrating family triumphs or weathering times of national turbulence, she figured out long ago how to stay calm, even-keeled and focused on what matters most, she reveals.""Life's circumstances shape you in many ways, often entirely beyond your control — your birth, parental influences and the world in which you grow up,"" writes the former first lady, and now the future first lady.""As an adult, there comes a moment when you become solely responsible for the life you lead. You must take charge, embrace that responsibility, and become the architect of your own future.""For her, she says, that moment was coming to America and New York City as an individual full of ""youthful confidence.""Self-care is ‘essential’That confidence, she indicates, had roots in her upbringing.""The value of self-care remains a guiding principle in my life.""Her mother, Amalija Knavs, born in 1945, taught her that ""self-care was essential not only to a person's well-being, but also to being able to effectively care for others,"" she writes.Her mother ""instilled this conviction in me from an early age, teaching me the importance of attending to one's appearance before venturing into the world.""Trump says her mother often told her, ""If I don't take care of myself, how would I know how to care for others?""""The value of self-care,"" she says, ""remains a guiding principle in my life.""‘Own identity'Melania Trump says that even as a child, she embraced a sense of ""organization and orderliness"" — taking a ""methodical approach"" to whatever projects she was working on or involved with. Over time, she writes, ""I learned that regardless of the circumstances or the company I found myself in, the most crucial relationship I could cultivate was the one I had with myself."" It's essential, she shares, ""to be grounded in one's own identity and values.

"Ex-Vatican ambassador, Pope Francis critic calls Harris 'infernal monster'","A former Vatican leader who was excommunicated earlier this year has urged Catholics to back former President Trump, arguing that Vice President Harris will build the ""most ferocious dictatorship"" if elected.Former Roman Catholic Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, who previously served as the Vatican’s ambassador to the U.S., wrote in an open letter Tuesday to American Catholics that Trump is ""the only possible choice"" as ""voting for Kamala Harris is morally inadmissible and constitutes a very grave sin.""""In this election you must choose between two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your Nation: you are called to choose between democracy and dictatorship, between freedom and slavery,"" Vigano wrote.Vigano wrote that while Trump has ""serious problems in his positions"" on abortion and assisted procreation, the former president aims to protect the ""fundamental freedoms of citizens.""""In Donald Trump’s America, every Catholic can practice their Faith and educate their children in it without interference from the State,"" the former archbishop wrote.Vigano called Harris ""an infernal monster who obeys Satan,"" arguing that in her America, Catholics and Protestants ""are considered fundamentalists to be marginalized and eliminated, and their children are considered the property of the State.""""Trump’s America can become great and prosperous again,"" he wrote. ""Harris’ America is destined for invasion and for moral, social, and economic destruction: the most ferocious dictatorship.""Under the Biden-Harris administration, Vigano described American cities as having become ""dumps filled with derelicts and criminals, drug dealers and addicts, prostitutes and robbers,"" while schools have turned into ""dens of indoctrination and corruption"" starting in kindergarten.Vigano also accused Harris as being a ""puppet"" of former President Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and liberal megadonor George Soros.Trump, Vigano argues, is ""committed to freeing America"" from what he called the ""tentacled grip"" of the so-called ""deep state.""Vigano served as the Vatican's ambassador to the United States, also known as the Apostolic Nuncio, from 2011 to 2016.In July, Vigano was found guilty of schism and excommunicated from the Catholic Church after years of intense disagreements with Pope Francis. Schism is the act of withdrawing submission to the pope or from the communion of Catholics who are subject to him.Catholics historically voted for Democrats until the 1960s and early 1970s, when crime and cultural issues came to the fore alongside economic concerns.Today, Catholic voters are evenly split between the two parties, and whichever side captures the majority is usually the side that wins the White House.",27-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-vatican-ambassador-pope-francis-critic-calls-harris-infernal-monster
GORDON SONDLAND: I was wrong about Trump and Democrats can't stand it,"Things could, and did, get worse for America after Jan. 6. I served in the Trump administration, but I withdrew my support from the president after that dark day. Four years later, I’m back. And here’s why. The Biden-Harris administration weakened our power, our pocketbooks and our values. After living under this reality for nearly four years, there is no choice: We need former President Donald J. Trump back in the White House. I’ve explained my change of heart across the national media from MSNBC to CNN to NPR. Yet instead of considering the content of my argument, most journalists have gone apoplectic about my decision that supporting Republican policies is more important than punishing a former president they loathe. If Vice President Kamala Harris can ""change her mind"" to soften border enforcement, why can’t someone on the other side of the aisle change his perspective? I can’t excuse Jan. 6 or the former president’s lackluster response to that dark day. But our system stood, the riot quelled, and the transfer of power completed. Skeptics wonder if there’s some sort of insidious reason behind my stance today. They ask: Has he offered me a job? No. Did he blackmail me? No. Do you think he won the 2020 election? No (sadly). Have you lost your moral compass? No. In fact, my moral compass heads due north toward what’s best for our country. As the twentieth U.S. ambassador to the European Union, I know and worked closely with Trump. He’s a showman who likes to shock. That’s obvious. What might be less obvious is that he’s also a swift and thoughtful decision maker. He doesn’t hem and haw or, like his opponent, need a script to stay on message.  And unlike the other side, Trump cares about fostering our country’s meritocracy, not mediocrity. He believes competition, not socialism, is best for our society. Harris represents a party at odds with this perspective. Indeed, Democrats are staging a strategic assault on our two-party democratic system and pushing policies that will further erode American prestige, pocketbooks and families. Harris has vowed to pack the Supreme Court, eliminate the filibuster, dramatically loosen voter regulations and empower unelected government employees to decide which cars we drive and on which stoves we cook. She wants to police what our children study and how we speak. She says she wouldn’t do anything different from President Joe Biden. That’s troubling at best. It means Harris agrees it was smart to withdraw U.S. military forces before civilians from Afghanistan. I guess she’s too young to recall Saigon or wasn’t moved when desperate innocents fell to their deaths from a U.S. aircraft escaping Kabul. It means she believes Biden was right to say that Washington wouldn’t react if Moscow made only a ""minor incursion"" into Ukraine. Talk about giving green lights to dictators. While Trump flatters bad guys in public as a counterintuitive and strategic tactic, no world leader doubts his resolve for America. We need that sort of leadership on the international stage because, thanks to the disastrous Biden-Harris foreign policy, allies and adversaries alike doubt America’s convictions and are confused about our positions. This would be problematic in any era, but especially worrisome in the shadows of a rising China and expansionist Russia. At home, Harris turns a blind eye to foreign influence that’s radicalizing our students to hate America. She never discusses the similarities to radicalized Iranian students who installed a fundamentalist government in Tehran that chants ""death to America"" and sponsors 13 terrorist groups, including Hamas. Harris says she ""understands the emotions"" driving college students who wear keffiyeh and call for the destruction of Jews. Would Harris be so sanguine if Blacks were targeted the way Jews were targeted? While I doubt Harris is truly antisemitic or wants to see the destruction of the State of Israel, her actions don’t live up to that of a strong supporter of Israel or an ally. Her ambition for votes (especially among Arab Americans in Michigan) has moved her dangerously close to Hamas’ agenda.  Harris’ economic stance is equally appalling. She cares more about distributing handouts to illegal immigrants than supporting people like my parents, Holocaust survivors who legally immigrated to the U.S. and opened a dry cleaner where they worked for decades. She thinks race should be a qualification for jobs and advantages. Moreover, Harris is part of the administration that used COVID-19 as an excuse to needlessly pump an extra $2 trillion into the economy, thereby ensuring inflation and, in essence, buying votes.Despite the White House’s denials, anyone who grocery shops knows the cost of living has skyrocketed. Not only among poor people, but among everyone. One friend, a college-educated divorced mother with an enviable white-collar job, forgoes meat herself to buy protein-rich steak for her teenage son. This isn’t the America our families need or want. Of course, the Democratic Party decries the importance of family. Harris reflects this demise. She supports old-fashioned entitlement programs and tax codes that encourage men to abandon their families. She opposes religious groups that wish to align business practices with their morals. She encourages immature young people to explore gender-affirming treatments that can’t be reversed in adulthood. She routinely supports teachers’ unions that drive anti-student, pro-employee political agendas. In a Harris world, teachers that can’t dispense aspirin without parental consent are punished for telling parents their child is changing sex. Taken collectively, the Harris agenda and her alignment with the Democratic base is an order of magnitude more frightening than Trump’s agenda or behavior. This is not a conspiracy theory or fearmongering. That’s why, even with all of Trump’s idiosyncrasies and inflammatory style, he is the best option for America. His policies are right. The team will be great. And given the choice, there is no other choice.",31-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gordon-sondland-i-wrong-about-trump-democrats-cant-stand
Biden's past comments about MAGA Republicans come back to haunt him as White House spins 'garbage' remarks,"As White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre attempted to spin President Biden's remark calling Trump supporters ""garbage,"" saying the ""president for all"" would never speak badly about people that support Trump, Biden's former comments about MAGA Republicans are coming back to haunt him.During a press briefing on Wednesday, Jean-Pierre insisted that Biden was not calling Trump supporters garbage, but instead was calling comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s joke about Puerto Rico ""garbage.""""He does not view Trump supporters or anybody who supports Trump as garbage. That is not what he views,"" the press secretary said of Biden. ""He has said multiple times that he is a president for all. It doesn't matter if you live in a red state, it doesn't matter if you live in a blue state. He has said it himself. I have said it on his behalf. He believes that he's a president for all. And it doesn't matter who you voted for, doesn't matter if you voted for him or not. He's a president for all. But hateful rhetoric, hateful rhetoric that he hears. And this is something that we've done many times from here. We will call that out. We will call that out.""During a virtual call with Voto Latino, Biden was asked about Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden, which made headlines after Hinchcliffe told a joke, referring to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage.""He responded by saying, ""Donald Trump has no character. He doesn't give a damn about the Latino community. He's a failed businessman. He only cares about the billionaire friends that he has and accumulating wealth for those at the top. He says immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country – give me a break. He wants to do away with the birthright citizenship. Who the hell has said that in the last hundred years? And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.' Well, let me tell you something. I don't -- I -- I don't know the Puerto Rican that -- that I know -- or a Puerto Rico, where I'm fr- -- in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters -- his -- his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.  It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been.""Now the White House is insisting that Biden would not speak badly about people that support Trump, but his past comments about MAGA Republicans seem to say otherwise.Sept. 5, 2022 – Laborfest, Milwaukee, WisconsinOn Sept. 5, 2022, Biden gave a Labor Day speech to workers in Milwaukee, where he went after MAGA Republicans and Trump supporters.""Look, extreme MAGA Republicans don’t just threaten our personal rights and our economic security, they embrace political violence,"" Biden said before attempting to clear up that he was only talking about MAGA Republicans and not all Republicans. ""The definition of democracy is you accept the will of the people when votes are honestly counted. These guys don’t do it.""He continued, referring to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., and saying MAGA Republicans in Congress continue to defend the ""mob"" that stormed the building that day.""This was an attack on American democracy,"" he said. ""We have to be stronger and more determined and more committed to saving American democracy than the MAGA Republicans and that guy… who are destroying democracy, because democracy is at stake.""Sept. 9, 2022 – Democratic National Committee, Forest Heights, MarylandWhile speaking at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Forest Heights, Maryland, on Sept. 9, 2022, Biden sharpened his attacks against Trump and MAGA Republicans for posing a threat to democracy.""Extreme MAGA Republicans just don’t threaten our personal and economic rights; they embrace political violence,"" the president said. ""Think about it. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They threaten our very democracy. They – and that’s not hyperbole – to this day, they defend the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.""Oct. 23, 2022 – Interview with MSNBC During an interview on Oct. 23, 2022, with MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart, Biden called out ""mega MAGA"" Republicans who ""think it’s alright to threaten violence.""""I think we’re at one of those inflection points in history, where we’ve reached a point where there has been such a division that you have what I call the mega MAGA republicans, who think that it’s all right to threaten violence… think that’s not inappropriate, talk about how they are concHe said the country had a leader who concluded the truth didn’t matter, then used the old modern version of ""the old racist kind of baiting,"" seen 40 to 50 years ago, that Biden said, did not take it seriously.Sept. 28, 2023 – Campaign Reception in Tempe, ArizonaBiden attended a campaign reception in Tempe, Arizona on Sept. 28, 2023, where again, he singled out MAGA supporters and accused them of posing a threat to democracy.""Their extreme agenda, if carried out, would fundamentally alter the institutions of American democracy as we know it,"" Biden said of MAGA republicans. ""My friends, they're not hiding their attacks; they're openly promoting them. Attacking the free press as the enemy of the people. Attacking the rule of law as an impediment. Fomenting voter suppression and election subversion.""This MAGA threat is a threat to the brick and mortar of our democratic institutions,"" he later told attendees. ""It's also a threat to the character of our nation that gives our Constitution life, that binds us together as Americans, a common cause. None of this is surprising, though. They've tried to govern that way before. Thank God they failed. But they haven't given up.""When asked about the contradictions between Jean-Pierre’s statements on Wednesday and remarks made by Biden in the past against MAGA Republicans, the White House referred Fox News Digital to a speech given by the president on Sept. 1, 2022.""Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,"" Biden said at the time.""Now, I want to be very clear…very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.I know because I’ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans,"" the president continued. ""But there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.""",30-Oct-24,Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-past-comments-about-maga-republicans-come-back-haunt-him-white-house-spins-garbage-remarks
