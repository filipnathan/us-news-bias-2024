Election results recap: Trump clinches White House victory,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the media after voting at a polling station setup in the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center on March 19, 2024, in Palm Beach, Florida.Florida has led the country in disenfranchising citizens with felony records. But Donald Trump, the only former president ever to be found guilty of criminal charges, should have no trouble casting his ballot in the Sunshine State.That's because Trump was convicted in New York.Under Florida law, an out-of-state felony conviction makes a person ineligible to vote only if they would also be ineligible in the state where they were found guilty.Trump on May 30 was convicted by a New York jury of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money scheme to pay porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence ahead of the 2016 election.
A New York law passed in 2021 allows for convicted felons to register to vote if they are not incarcerated. It also restores the voting rights of convicted felons upon their release from incarceration.On Sept. 6, Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan ruled that Trump will not be sentenced in the hush money case until Nov. 26 — three weeks after Election Day.
Trump traveled back to Florida on Tuesday, and he is expected to cast his ballot near his Mar-a-Lago home in West Palm Beach.

Donald Trump defeats Kamala Harris to win 2024 presidential election,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will defeat his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris, and return to the White House for another four years, NBC News projects. After losing his reelection bid to President Joe Biden in 2020, Trump, the 45th president, will now become the 47th. Trump's victory marks a series of historic firsts. At 78, he is the oldest person ever to win a U.S. presidential election. He will be the first president in 132 years — since Grover Cleveland — to serve two nonconsecutive terms in office. And he emerged victorious from what is likely the most expensive presidential race in history. He is also the first president, current or former, ever to be convicted of crimes. He is the first twice-impeached president ever to win back the White House. He is the first president ever to take office while fending off criminal charges in multiple active federal and state cases. Trump's win denies Harris, the vice president, what would have been her own historic milestone: becoming the first woman president of the United States.Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a campaign event at the Erie Insurance Arena in Erie, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 14, 2024. Dustin Franz | Afp | Getty ImagesIt also represents a staggering political achievement for Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who won his first election just two years earlier. Just 40 years old, Vance, a former Trump critic turned loyalist and top advocate for the president-elect's right-wing populist movement, is now first in the presidential line of succession. If Trump pursues his campaign promises, his second administration will soon set out to enact an ambitious, controversial agenda centered on deep tax cuts, mass deportations and reshaped relationships with foreign leaders. Trump has also vowed to impose heavy tariffs, claiming that they will simultaneously boost U.S. revenues, strengthen domestic industries and deter unwanted foreign competition. Mainstream economists have repeatedly warned that the tariffs, which are taxes paid by U.S. importers, will raise prices on American consumers. It remains to be seen to what extent Trump's presidential agenda will resemble the sum of his many claims as a candidate. He has vowed to pardon his supporters who violently rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He has assured that he will quickly broker an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a vague stance that threatens to undo the Biden administration's policy of strong support for Kyiv. He has said he would put Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, in charge of health policy, and tap billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk to propose trillions of dollars in government spending cuts. He has denied Democrats' warnings that he will behave in office like a dictator, ""except for Day One.""A campaign like no otherRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is surrounded by U.S. Secret Service agents at a campaign rally, Saturday, July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pa. Evan Vucci | APThe campaign that delivered Trump's election was no less historic. Trump survived an assassination attempt in mid-July, when Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old registered Republican who had donated to a Democratic group, opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Crooks fatally shot one rally attendee, and one of his bullets grazed Trump's ear, streaking his face with blood. Trump's immediate reaction to the shooting — pumping his fist and defiantly telling his supporters to ""fight!"" as Secret Service agents rushed him off stage — instantly became a defining moment of the campaign. Just a few days later, the race was shaken up again. In late July, Harris, 60, was catapulted to the top of the Democratic presidential ticket after Biden announced he would no longer seek reelection.",Nov 6 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-wins-2024-election-for-president.html
"Presidential election is a dead heat though Trump leads Harris big on economy, says CNBC survey","With less than two weeks remaining before the election, the CNBC All-America Economic Survey shows the presidential contest remains a statistical dead heat both nationally and in the battleground states, unchanged from the August survey though there have been some notable movements among key groups.Nationally, former President Donald Trump holds a 48%-46% lead over Vice President Kamala Harris, within the poll's 3.1% margin of error and unchanged from August. In the seven battleground states, Trump leads 48% to 47%, within the 4% margin of error for that portion of the poll.The survey was conducted from Oct. 15-19 and had a total sample of 1,000 voters nationwide. The nationwide sample included 186 voters from the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. An additional 400 voters were interviewed in those states for a total sample of 586 from battleground states.Both nationally and in the battlegrounds, economic issues remain the most important concern for voters. Trump holds commanding leads among voters who prioritize inflation, the economy and addressing the needs of the middle class. By a 42% to 24% margin, voters say they will be better off financially if Trump wins, with 29% saying their financial position wouldn't change no matter who is elected. Voters who say inflation and the cost of living and the economy overall are the top issues favor Trump by 13 points. Inflation has remained the top issue throughout the election cycle.""Even as the data show inflation has theoretically been slowing down, it has become more important in people's minds over the course of the last three quarters, not less important,"" said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the Democratic pollster for the survey.The survey also showed Trump has a 35-point advantage among voters most concerned about immigration and a 19-point edge on the issue of crime and safety.Harris leads on a variety of second-tier issues, areas of high concern that rate below the economy. They include a 31-point Harris advantage among voters most concerned about abortion, 9 points on protecting democracy, 8 points on health care and 60 points on climate change.",Oct 24 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/24/presidential-election-is-a-dead-heat-though-trump-leads-harris-big-on-economy-says-cnbc-survey.html

Stocks that investors believed would benefit under a Trump administration soared, while solar stocks plunged.""We're going to help our country heal,"" Trump said late Tuesday night. ""We're going to fix everything about our country.""""America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,"" he said, a reality underscored by NBC News' projection that Republicans won control of the Senate. The GOP was well positioned as of late Wednesday to keep its House majority, too, although NBC News had not called House control as of 7 p.m. ET.Harris phoned Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him on the win, then formally conceded the race and called on her supporters to mobilize and ""roll up your sleeves"" in a rousing speech at Howard University.",Nov 7 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-live-updates-markets-and-world-leaders-react-to-americas-president-elect.html

"More than 46 million early voters already cast ballots as Harris, Trump enter final sprint","Local residents line up to enter a polling site on the first day of early in-person voting in a region still severely impacted by the storm, in Asheville, North Carolina, on Oct. 17, 2024.More than 46 million Americans have cast their ballots in the 2024 election as of Tuesday morning, according to NBC News' tracker, accounting for over a quarter of the anticipated electorate.Both nominees, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, have encouraged voters to get to the ballot box as soon as they can.With one week until the Nov. 5 election, early voting is underway in all seven battleground states, along with dozens of others. Reports of hourslong lines outside polling places have already sprouted up on social media, as voters flood the limited number of municipal spaces set up to accommodate early voting.While millions of Americans have stood in line to cast ballots in person, another 20 million have mailed in their ballots. The 46.5 million early votes are almost evenly split between ballots cast in person and by mail, according to the University of Florida's Election Lab.Some states, such as the key presidential battlegrounds of North Carolina and Georgia, have reported that their early voter turnout is setting records this election cycle.In North Carolina, 353,166 ballots were accepted on the first day of early voting on Oct. 17, beating the 2020 first-day record, according to preliminary State Board of Elections data. As of Tuesday, more than 2.7 million votes had been cast across the state, according to NBC News.

"Harris leads Trump by 20 points with younger Americans, new CNBC/Generation Lab survey finds","Democratic presidential nominee and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign event in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 16, 2024.Exactly two weeks before Election Day, a new CNBC/Generation Lab survey finds that Vice President Kamala Harris has grown her advantage in recent months over Republican Donald Trump among Americans between the ages of 18 and 34.The latest quarterly Youth & Money Survey shows Harris with a 20 percentage point lead over the former president, with 60% of respondents saying they would vote for Harris in a head-to-head matchup, and 40% saying they would cast a ballot for Trump.Faced with a similar question in July's Youth & Money Survey, only 46% of respondents selected Harris, while 34% said they would be voting for Trump. Another 21% in that poll said they would vote for then-candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or another third-party option.Kennedy formally dropped his bid for president on Aug. 23, and respondents in the latest poll were not offered a third option.Harris' 20 point lead over Trump in the latest poll is in line with the margin by which President Joe Biden ultimately won younger voters in his 2020 presidential election victory. Facing an incumbent Trump, Biden won voters age 18 to 39 years old by roughly 20 points, according to Pew Research Center data.The latest poll results also hint at an enthusiasm gap among young voters, which Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are working hard to close.When pollsters asked the question, ""How do you feel about the slate of Presidential candidates,"" a sizable 38% of the respondents chose, ""I am disappointed."" Another 41% of the survey sample reported ""I am neutral."" Only one-fifth of those polled chose the third option, ""I am excited,"" to describe their feelings about the Harris-Trump matchup.

Why it would be difficult for Trump to reverse the 2024 election results,"Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump looks on during a roundtable with faith leaders at Christ Chapel on October 23, 2024 in Zebulon, Georgia.
Donald Trump has ramped up his baseless accusations that Democrats are plotting to ""cheat"" or ""steal"" the election, raising fears that the former president is setting the stage for an attempt to overturn the result if Vice President Kamala Harris wins.But any effort to derail the electoral process would run up against an array of new guardrails this time around, legal experts say, making it unlikely that any such attempt would succeed. The new protections include: an electoral law Congress passed in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection, recent court rulings, more vigilance from state election officials and more aggressive law enforcement by agencies determined to avoid a repeat of violent scenes from the U.S. Capitol four years ago.""It's very hard this time,"" said law professor Richard Hasen, an election expert at UCLA.In 2020, Trump issued similar warnings before the vote. When he lost to Joe Biden, he lobbied officials in swing states to overturn the result, filed a flurry of lawsuits claiming fraud and demanded his vice president, Mike Pence, refuse to certify the result.But state officials resisted his pressure, judges tossed out his team's lawsuits, and Pence defied Trump and carried out his constitutional duty to affirm the result of the vote.Unlike in 2020, Trump is no longer the president and does not have the power of the executive branch at his disposal. And the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act, passed in 2022, tightened the process to cast and count electoral votes, gave federal courts a clear role to quickly resolve disputes and made it more difficult for lawmakers to raise frivolous objections.Some attempts by pro-Trump groups to alter how votes are counted and certified have already failed, with judges rejecting the measures as illegal and unconstitutional. Last week, Georgia's Supreme Court rejected an effort by pro-Trump Republicans to introduce new election laws in the state, including one that would have required hand-counting of ballots and others that would have delayed the certification process.If Trump sought to challenge the election results, he would have two potential paths to try to overturn the results, and both routes are ""long shots,"" said Hasen, director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA Law School.One would be to try to delay certifying the results in certain counties or states by alleging irregularities or making other claims. Dozens of state and local election officials are now in office in swing states who have openly rejected the 2020 results, raising the possibility that they could refuse to certify the vote count or cause other delays.
But such efforts would most likely fizzle out, legal experts said. State secretaries of state and attorney generals in key states like Pennsylvania and Arizona have vowed to take local governments to court if they try to delay the process.""You may still have some people trying to engage in these shenanigans,"" said Gowri Ramachandran of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. ""But I think, ultimately, a combination of the state election officials, the attorney generals, who often represent them in court, and the courts themselves are going to tell people to just do their jobs and certify the correct results.""Last month, top officials in three swing states — Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin — said they are ready to take local government authorities to court if they refuse to certify the results.""We would immediately take them to court to compel them to certify, and we're confident — because of how clear the election law is in Pennsylvania — that the courts would expeditiously require the counties to certify their election results,"" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt said.

Trump takes a rare break from social media after election win,"Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to speak with former first lady Melania Trump during an election night event at the Palm Beach Convention Center on November 06, 2024 in West Palm Beach, Florida.Donald Trump has never been shy about touting his accomplishments. Yet after achieving what is arguably the greatest political feat of his career, the new president-elect has so far been silent on the social media platforms where he is normally a ubiquitous presence.As of Thursday afternoon, Trump had not posted on Truth Social, the platform operated by his social media company Trump Media , since before all polls closed on Election Day. Nor has he trumpeted his victory on X, the social media site owned by his top campaign backer Elon Musk.Trump's official Facebook , Instagram and TikTok accounts also have not been updated since Tuesday. The most recent posts on all three are video messages of Trump urging Republican voters to stay in line at their polling sites.It is unclear if Trump's online absence is a deliberate messaging choice, or if he is merely taking a break from social media after a campaign during which he posted prolifically.Asked for clarity, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said only, ""President Trump won a historic election and will now become the 47th President of the United States.""",Nov 7 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/trump-x-truth-social-djt-election.html

 Musk pushes debunked Dominion voting conspiracy theory at first Pennsylvania appearance,"Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk, who supports Republican presidential nominee former U.S. President Donald Trump, gestures as he speaks about voting during an America PAC Town Hall in Folsom, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 17, 2024.Billionaire Elon Musk promoted debunked conspiracy theories about election fraud Thursday at the first of a series of planned campaign events across Pennsylvania meant to rally support for former President Donald Trump's campaign.At a town hall hosted at a high school outside Philadelphia, Musk referred to the false conspiracy theory that Dominion Voting Systems was part of a plot to rig U.S. elections in recent years.""When you have mail-in ballots and no proof of citizenship, it's almost impossible to prove cheating,"" he said, responding to an audience member's question about election fraud. ""Statistically there are some very strange things that happen that are statistically incredibly unlikely. There's always this question of, say, the Dominion voting machines. It is weird that, I think, they were used in Philadelphia and in Maricopa County [in Arizona] but not in a lot of other places. Doesn't that seem like a heck of a coincidence?""""The last thing I would do is trust a computer program,"" he said, promoting the idea that U.S. elections should use only paper ballots. The Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive nonprofit law and public policy institute, has found that 98% of votes in the general election are expected to be cast on paper ballots.Dominion did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has broadly rejected any claims that it has participated in efforts to manipulate elections. Last year, it struck a $787.5 million settlement with Fox News in its defamation lawsuit against the media outlet over such claims.Contrary to Musk's claim that Dominion's software was used in only a small number of counties, a Reuters fact-check found that Dominion systems were used in at least 24 states for the 2020 elections.Musk's appearance, which was streamed live by the Philadelphia Fox station, as well as on X, comes as Musk has ramped up his support for Trump. Musk has given nearly $75 million to his pro-Trump America PAC, which he established this year. Two weeks ago, he joined Trump onstage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.Musk has also turned his own X account, with more than 200 million followers, into a nearly nonstop stream of Trump support, in which he has repeatedly pushed false claims about immigration and voter fraud.Studies and investigations have found that there's no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the U.S. When voter fraud has occurred, prosecutors have successfully brought cases against perpetrators including in a highly publicized fraud scheme in North Carolina.Musk spoke for about 10 minutes in what seemed to be off-the-cuff remarks that ranged from concerns about censorship and government spending to the Second Amendment and safety in cities, making the claim that cities have become less safe for their residents. The most recent data released by the FBI has suggested that crime has generally been dropping across the U.S., including in major cities.Speaking about the U.S.-Mexico border, Musk compared it to the zombie movie ""World War Z.""Musk then took questions for about 40 minutes, at one point engaging with a member of the audience who was shouting about Democratic megadonor George Soros, who has long been the subject of antisemitic conspiracy theories. In response, Musk called Soros ""evil"" and said he is ""tearing down the fabric of society.""In a response to another question, Musk pushed a baseless conspiracy theory that Vice President Kamala Harris was being controlled by an unknown group of people.Musk repeatedly encouraged the audience members to engage their friends and family members and get them registered to vote in the state — where the deadline to register is Monday.""Pennsylvania is the linchpin in this election, and this election is going to decide the fate of America and, along with America, the fate of Western civilization,"" Musk told the crowd as he stood in front of an American flag.",Oct 17 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/17/musk-pushes-debunked-dominion-voting-conspiracy-theory-at-first-pennsylvania-appearance.html

Bitcoin, like gold, is seen by many investors as a hedge against the potential for fiscal and monetary policy that combine to reduce the value of the dollar and lift inflation.Trump had presented himself as the pro-crypto candidate early in the race and courted the industry directly. That included declarations that he would install a crypto advisory council in his first 100 days in office, establish favorable regulation to encourage domestic ""made in the USA"" bitcoin mining, launch a strategic national bitcoin stockpile and – what perhaps resonated most strongly with the industry – replace Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler.Gensler has become an adversary to the crypto industry, which has long been frustrated with the refusal of the SEC, under his leadership, to provide clear guidance for U.S. crypto businesses – choosing instead to regulate by enforcement, the industry says. Because of that, largely, this year's presidential election has been called the most important one in the crypto industry's lifetime.""While President-elect Trump has claimed to make the U.S. the 'crypto capital' of the world, the details of his plans remain to be seen, and I expect it to take some time to truly understand his stance towards crypto,"" said Anthony Yeung, global head of strategic development at CoinCover.""It's in the interest of the industry that the U.S. moves sooner rather than later when it comes to crafting a regulatory framework,"" he said. ""What it needs is targeted and proportionate regulation that prioritizes consumer protection and encourages innovation. Striking this balance will require close collaboration between regulators, policy makers and industry participants.""In the 2012, 2016 and 2020 elections, bitcoin saw returns of roughly 87%, 44% and 145% in the 90 days following election day, respectively. That's in part because election years happen to fall on Bitcoin halving years, when the supply of the cryptocurrency ratchets downward. Post election returns have also tended to align with major Federal Reserve policy shifts. This year, the market is looking forward to further interest rate reductions.

American interest in moving abroad skyrockets after Trump's win — here's how many would actually leave,"Americans disappointed with the outcome of the U.S. election took their anguish online, with searches related to moving abroad surging following the results of the presidential race.Google Trends showed that searches related to ""leaving the country"" and ""how to move to …"" spiked following the news that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House.Searches for ""how to move to Canada"" peaked on Nov. 6, with Google Trends showing interest in the phrase highest among Democratic strongholds, like Vermont, Maine, Oregon and Washington.Those searching for ""can I move to another country"" were highest in two pivotal ""blue wall"" swing states — Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which NBC News has called for Trump — as well as Oregon, Minnesota and Indiana.A survey conducted earlier this month found that 21% of Americans said they would consider moving abroad if their preferred candidate lost the race.However, the sentiment seemed to be founded more on frustration, rather than actual intention, according to the survey conducted by Casino.org, which provides news, information and research to gamers.Among those polled, nearly 60% said they would be ""very unlikely"" to move, while only 2.6% said they were ""very likely"" to uproot and leave.

Europe praises Trump's victory amid wider fears of an impending economic nightmare,"Donald Trump (L), President of the USA, and Emmanuel Macron, President of France, join hands during the final press conference of the G7 Summit on 26 August 2019, in Biarritz, France. NurPhoto | NurPhoto | Getty ImagesEuropean officials have been quick to congratulate Donald Trump after he defeated his Democratic rival Kamala Harris to return to the White House, despite a stark realization that renewed economic warfare could be just around the corner. European diplomats and their respective leaders have been preparing for the eventuality of a Trump victory for more than 12 months, placing a growing focus on policies that could protect the European economy from potential trade disputes. Some European officials woke up to election results on Wednesday ""not wanting to believe"" them, several sources told CNBC. ""I am seeing it, [and] not wanting to believe,"" said one EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitive nature of the transatlantic relationship. ""But I am not as shocked as last time."" Many European leaders did not enjoy Trump's style of confrontational leadership during his first presidency, and there were several moments of tension with the former White House leader. As a result, many in Brussels celebrated the victory of Joe Biden in 2020, hoping for a better engagement.A second EU source, who also did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the relationship, said: ""It is not great, again."" But the source echoed the feelings of the previous official, acknowledging, ""At least, I am not as surprised [as in 2016].""EU leaders to meet ThursdayEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban were among the first EU leaders to offer their congratulations to Trump on Wednesday morning. Concerns regarding Trump are not wholly shared across the European continent. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has in the past spoken of his admiration for Trump, has previously reportedly said that he would open a bottle of champagne if Trump were elected. EU leaders are scheduled to meet for a regular meeting Thursday and Friday in the Hungarian capital of Budapest, which will provide them with an opportunity to discuss their future plans for the transatlantic relationship. Trump has threatened to impose an additional 10% in tariffs on European nations, while also saying that the European Union would have to ""pay a big price"" for not buying enough American goods.watch nowTrade with the United States is critical for European nations. The EU and the U.S. have the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world, which reached an all-time high of 1.2 trillion euros ($1.29 trillion) in 2021, according to data from the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU. Any additional tariffs could further pressure the already moribund economic growth levels across the EU. ""There will be a first discussion [on the outcome of the U.S. election] in Budapest,"" a third anonymous EU source told CNBC Wednesday morning, regarding the meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) which will start Nov. 7. ""We will see what sort of rhetoric [Trump] will have, but if it is not very different, the main challenge will be Ukraine,"" the third diplomat said.

"Jeff Bezos killed Washington Post endorsement of Kamala Harris, paper reports","The Washington Post Building at One Franklin Square Building in Washington, D.C., June 5, 2024. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe Washington Post said Friday that it will not endorse a candidate in the presidential election this year — or ever again — breaking decades of tradition and sparking immediate criticism of the decision. But the newspaper also published an article by two staff reporters revealing that editorial page staffers had drafted an endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris over GOP nominee Donald Trump in the election. ""The decision not to publish was made by The Post's owner — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos,"" the article said, citing two sources briefed on the events. Trump, while president, had been critical of the billionaire Bezos and the Post, which he purchased in 2013. The newspaper in 2016 and again in 2020 endorsed Trump's election opponents, Hillary Clinton and President Joe Biden, in editorials that condemned the Republican in blunt terms. In a 2019 lawsuit, Amazon claimed it had lost a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon to Microsoft because Trump had used ""improper pressure ... to harm his perceived political enemy"" Bezos. The Post since 1976 had regularly endorsed candidates for president, except for the 1988 race. All those endorsements had been for Democrats. In a statement to CNBC, when asked about Bezos' purported role in killing the endorsement, Post chief communications officer Kathy Baird said, ""This was a Washington Post decision to not endorse, and I would refer you to the publisher's statement in full."" On Saturday, Post publisher Will Lewis issued a statement denying that Bezos played a role in killing the planned endorsement. ""Reporting around the role of The Washington Post owner and the decision not to publish a presidential endorsement has been inaccurate,"" Lewis said in the statement. ""He was not sent, did not read and did not opine on any draft. As Publisher, I do not believe in presidential endorsements. We are an independent newspaper and should support our readers' ability to make up their own minds."" The Post on Friday evening published a third article, signed by opinion columnists for the newspaper, who said, ""The Washington Post's decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake."" ""It represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love, and for which we have worked a combined 218 years,"" the column said. ""This is a moment for the institution to be making clear its commitment to democratic values, the rule of law and international alliances, and the threat that Donald Trump poses to them — the precise points The Post made in endorsing Trump's opponents in 2016 and 2020."" CNBC has requested comment from Amazon, where Bezos remains the largest shareholder.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos arrives for his meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the UK diplomatic residence in New York City, Sept. 20, 2021. Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesLewis, in an article published online explaining the decision, wrote, ""The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election."" ""We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates,"" Lewis wrote. ""We recognize that this will be read in a range of ways, including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another, or as an abdication of responsibility,"" he wrote. ""That is inevitable. We don't see it that way. We see it as consistent with the values The Post has always stood for and what we hope for in a leader: character and courage in service to the American ethic, veneration for the rule of law, and respect for human freedom in all its aspects."" Seven of the 13 paragraphs of Lewis' article either quoted at length or referred to Post Editorial Board statements in 1960 and 1972 explaining the paper's rationale for not endorsing presidential candidates in those years, which included its identity as ""an independent newspaper."" Lewis noted that the paper had endorsed Jimmy Carter in 1976 ""for understandable reasons at the times"" — which he did not identify. ""But we had it right before that, and this is what we are going back to,"" Lewis wrote. ""Our job as the newspaper of the capital city of the most important country in the world is to be independent,"" he wrote. ""And that is what we are and will be."" Post editor-at-large Robert Kagan, a member of the paper's opinions section, resigned following the decision, multiple news outlets reported. More than 10,000 reader comments were posted on Lewis' article, many of them blasting the Post for its decision and saying they were canceling their subscriptions. ""The most consequential election in our country, a choice between Fascism and Democracy, and you sit out? Cowards. Unethical, fearful cowards,"" wrote one comment. ""Oh, and by the way, I'm canceling my subscription, because you are putting business ahead of ethics and morals."" The announcement came days after Mariel Garza, the head of The Los Angeles Times' editorial board, resigned in protest after that paper's owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, decided against running a presidential endorsement. ""I am resigning because I want to make it clear that I am not okay with us being silent,"" Garza told the Columbia Journalism Review. ""In dangerous times, honest people need to stand up. This is how I'm standing up."" Soon-Shiong, like Bezos, is a billionaire. Marty Baron, the former editor of The Washington Post, called that paper's decision ""cowardice, with democracy as its casualty."" ?@realdonaldtrump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner @jeffbezos (and others),"" Baron wrote. ""Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage."" The Washington Post Guild, the union that represents the newspaper's staff, in a statement posted on the social media site X said it was ""deeply concerned that The Washington Post — an American news institution in the nation's capital — would make a decision to no longer endorse presidential candidates, especially a mere 11 days ahead of an immensely consequential election."" ""The message from our chief executive, Will Lewis — not from the Editorial Board itself — makes us concerned that management interfered with the work of our members in Editorial,"" the Guild said in the statement, which noted the paper's reporting about Bezos' role in the decision. ""We are already seeing cancellations from once loyal readers,"" the Guild said. ""This decision undercuts the work of our members at a time when we should be building our readers' trust, not losing it.""

Trump victory may provide TikTok a lifeline to remain in the U.S.,"Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, (C) greets attendees during a campaign stop to address Pennsylvanians who are concerned about the threat of Communist China to U.S. agriculture at the Smith Family Farm September 23, 2024 in Smithton, Pennsylvania.After Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency last week, tech CEOs including Apple 's Tim Cook, Meta 's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon 's Jeff Bezos publicly praised the president-elect.One name was conspicuously missing: TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.His absence was notable considering that of all the top tech companies, TikTok faces the most immediate and existential threat from the U.S. government. In April, President Joe Biden signed a law that requires China's ByteDance to sell TikTok by Jan. 19. If ByteDance fails to comply, internet hosting companies and app store owners such as Apple and Google will be prohibited from supporting TikTok, effectively banning it in the U.S.Trump's return to the White House, though, may provide a lifeline for Chew and TikTok.Although both Republicans and Democrats supported the Biden TikTok ban in April, Trump voiced opposition to the ban during his candidacy. Trump acknowledged the national security and data privacy concerns with TikTok in a March interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" but he also said ""there's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad"" with the app.Trump also leveraged TikTok's shaky future in the U.S. as a reason for people to vote against Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris.""We're not doing anything with TikTok, but the other side is going to close it up, so if you like TikTok, go out and vote for Trump,"" the president-elect said in a September post on his Truth Social service.Since his election, Trump hasn't publicly discussed his plans for TikTok, but Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNBC that the president-elect ""will deliver.""""The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,"" Leavitt said in a statement.Trump's rhetoric on TikTok began to turn after the president-elect met in February with billionaire Jeff Yass, a Republican megadonor and a major investor in the Chinese-owned social media app.Yass's trading firm Susquehanna International Group owns a 15% stake in ByteDance while Yass maintains a 7% stake in the company, equating to about $21 billion, NBC and CNBC reported in March. That month it was also reported that Yass was a part owner of the business that merged with the parent company of Trump's Truth Social.",Nov 13 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/trump-victory-may-provide-tiktok-a-lifeline-to-remain-in-the-us.html

"Trump likely to uphold CHIPS Act despite his campaign rhetoric, policy experts say","A Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. facility under construction in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., on Dec. 6, 2022. Caitlin O'Hara | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident-elect Donald Trump is unlikely to roll back the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act, despite his campaign rhetoric on the bill, experts say. The legislation, which provides incentives for chipmakers to set up manufacturing in the U.S., became a point of contention in the final month of the election cycle. Trump criticized the bill and its price tag. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, then said that his party ""probably will"" try to repeal the law. Johnson later walked the statement back. Still, the key Biden policy, which has massive implications for Asian chips makers like TSMC and Samsung, is likely safe in the near term, according to chip experts. Despite signaling he's ""not thrilled"" about the bill, Trump is probably not going to roll it back, Paul Triolo, senior vice president for China and technology policy lead at Albright Stonebridge, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Thursday. ""There's support for this kind of onshoring of advanced manufacturing,"" he added.Both Democrats and Republicans supported the passage of efforts to boost semiconductor manufacturing investment in the U.S., Chris Miller, author of ""Chip War,"" said earlier this year. He expected such policies would remain a priority regardless of the elections. The Biden administration signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act in August 2022, committing almost $53 billion to invest in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research with the aim of boosting U.S. competitiveness with China. The former president made headlines in October by attacking the legislation as a ""bad"" deal during a three hour interview with popular podcaster Joe Rogan. ""We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they're not going to give us the good companies anyway,"" he said, arguing instead that his proposal to increase tariffs would attract chip companies for free. The allocation of the CHIPS Act has been slow, with the lion's share of the earmarked funds yet to be doled out. So far, the bill has attracted Asian chip makers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung to build U.S. facilities. The two companies have already been offered $6.6 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. The largest CHIPS Act beneficiary has been the American chip maker Intel , which has been awarded $8.5 billion in funding.

Trump says he would 'fire' Jack Smith 'within two seconds' if elected,"Special counsel Jack Smith, left, seen in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 1, and former President Donald Trump, seen in Palm Beach, Florida, on Nov. 8, 2022.Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that he would immediately fire special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two federal indictments against Trump, if he's elected to as second term in the White House.Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump in an interview if he plans to pardon himself or fire Smith on the day he would take the oath of office.""It's so easy — I would fire him within two seconds,"" said Trump, who added that he got ""immunity at the Supreme Court"" and called Smith a ""crooked person.""The former president also said he doesn't think Democrats, if they retake the House majority, would impeach him if he fires Smith from the Department of Justice.Smith's office declined to comment on Trump's remarks. Firing him as special counsel potentially could end the federal government's prosecution against Trump. While Smith has appealed the ruling in Florida dismissing the classified documents case against the former president, the special counsel is still pursuing the election interference case against him in Washington, D.C.Trump has successfully delayed court proceedings in the election interference case because of his claims of presidential immunity, which were ultimately ruled on by the Supreme Court in July, so a trial has not been set in the case.Judge Tanya Chutkan allowed the release of hundreds of pages of heavily redacted documents last week that contained evidence the special counsel was using for the prosecution.In response, Trump called Chutkan ""the most evil person"" and Smith ""a sick puppy"" and characterized the release as ""election interference."" The former president has disparaged them both numerous times, which led the judge to issue a gag order on him. It prohibited Trump from making statements about potential witnesses or the federal prosecutors who charged him.Last year, Trump warned that Smith and other Justice Department officials would wind up in a mental institution if he's re-elected.In an effort to preempt any moves by Trump if he returns to the White House, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a fierce Trump critic, introduced legislation last month with Democratic cosponsors that would prevent a sitting president from dismissing an active criminal prosecution against him or herself, a measure that will go nowhere in the Republican-run House.

"More Iran sanctions and 'drill baby, drill': Oil market's future is still uncertain under Trump","Offshore workers examine hydrocarbon samples aboard the Chevron Corp. Jack/St. Malo deepwater oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, U.S., on Friday, May 18, 2018. Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesU.S. oil producers are looking forward to less regulations on crude production under a Donald Trump presidency, meaning higher oil supply and consequently lower prices. But it's not that straightforward: Trump who was announced Wednesday as the winner of the 2024 election, has also vowed to put more sanctions on Iranian and Venezuelan barrels, meaning the global market could become tighter, potentially boosting prices. At the same time, the increased likelihood of trade wars under Trump could dampen global economic growth and slow oil demand. So the picture for the market's longer-term outlook is, well, decidedly mixed. ""Conceptually, the impact of a potential second Trump term on oil prices is ambiguous, with some short-term downside risk to Iran oil supply ... and thus upside price risk,"" Goldman Sachs commodities analysts wrote in a research note Monday. ""But medium-term downside risk to oil demand and thus oil prices from downside risk to global GDP from a potential escalation in trade tensions.""Trump expressed his enthusiasm for increased U.S. oil production while giving a speech from the Republican campaign headquarters in Florida on Wednesday, just hours before his victory was confirmed. He made a reference to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the independent candidate who he said would become a part of his team. ""Bobby, stay away from the oil, stay away from the liquid gold!"" Trump said in a joking tone. ""We have more than Saudi Arabia and Russia."" Kennedy is known for his history of environmental activism. U.S. oil and gas production hit record highs under the Biden administration, which gradually changed its approach to the industry despite campaigning on pledges of environmental stewardship. U.S. crude futures — both West Texas Intermediate and international benchmark Brent crude — are currently trading in the $70 to $75 per barrel range, which is lower than what many oil producers seek to balance their costs and budgets amid slowed global demand for oil and growing supply.But a further push to open drilling projects, putting more supply on the market, would lead to lower prices, thereby decreasing revenues for American producers, said Cole Smead, president and CEO of Smead Capital. ""If the Trump administration opens up federal leases for oil and gas, Federal lands would get 25% per barrel of revenues. You will have a lot of trouble finding an oil company that can make money at $52.50 per barrel with what they have left from a $70 barrel,"" Smead said in emailed notes. ""The only thing that will cause drill baby drill to happen is higher oil prices based on these margins."" ""Drill baby, drill is going to run into the energy vigilantes,"" he added. ""Now that equity investors in the energy business know what free cash flow looks like they won't give it up. They will allow capital expenditures to go up over their dead body.""'Clear competitive advantage'The U.S. is the world's largest oil producer, accounting for 22% of the global total, according to the Energy Information Administration, with Saudi Arabia next, producing 11%. The vast majority of U.S. crude is consumed within the country, which is also the world's largest oil consumer. The CEO of French oil major TotalEnergies told CNBC over the weekend that whoever wins the presidency should ensure that the U.S. doesn't lose its energy advantage. ""U.S. energy has been unleashed ... since the last two, three years, production of oil has never been so high,"" in the country, Patrick Pouyanne told CNBC in Abu Dhabi. ""For me, today, the U.S. has a clear competitive advantage on energy compared to many [in the] rest of the world,"" he said. ""So I will be surprised to see whoever is elected lose the competitive advantage.""",Nov 6 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/oil-markets-future-still-uncertain-under-donald-trump-after-election-win.html 
Here's what Trump promised the crypto industry ahead of the election,"As Donald Trump celebrated his prospective victory on Election Night at Mar-a-Lago, he was joined by a roster of high-profile supporters. Among them were Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick. One thing those three people have in common: crypto. It's an industry that Trump talked little about until recently but has counted on for large amounts of cash for his campaign and related PACs. Getting that money required him to make big promises pertaining to the crypto industry. Digital asset markets surged on Election Night, with bitcoin hitting a record of over $75,000, as his victory began looking likely. Crypto-linked stocks like Coinbase and MicroStrategy moved higher as well in after-hours trading Tuesday. With a Republican-controlled Senate on the horizon, Trump has few roadblocks to putting in place a more pro-crypto platform. Here are some of the things he's pledged to do:Strategic national crypto stockpileIn Nashville in July, Trump headlined the biggest bitcoin conference of the year. In his keynote address, the former president said that if he returned to the White House, he would ensure the federal government never sells off its bitcoin holdings. However, he stopped short of proposing a formal federal reserve of digital currency. ""For too long our government has violated the cardinal rule that every bitcoiner knows by heart: Never sell your bitcoin,"" Trump said during his keynote speech. Trump pledged to maintain the current level of bitcoin holdings that the U.S. has amassed from seizing assets from financial criminals. ""If I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future,"" he said. Currently, the U.S. Marshals Service regularly auctions off bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies held in the country's coffers such as ether and litecoin. These sales can sometimes trigger drops in crypto prices, like earlier this year when Germany began to liquidate hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin it had seized.'On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler'In public remarks for months, Trump has promised to unseat U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler. ""On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler,"" Trump said, referencing the Joe Biden-appointed SEC chairman who has taken an aggressive approach to crypto regulation. The president does not have the power to fire the SEC chair. Even if Trump were to appoint a new chairman, Gensler would remain a commissioner on the independent agency. Gensler has brought more than 100 actions against crypto firms during his tenure at the helm of the commission. In multiple interviews, the SEC chair has said he believes much of the industry already belongs under its jurisdiction, and its lawsuits are simply bringing the sector under compliance. Crypto firms argue that the recent legal battles haven't given the regulatory clarity the industry has been seeking, and they instead reflect a gross overreach by the commission. Trump also vowed to create a ""bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council."" ""The rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,"" he said. Trump has expressly spoken out about his qualms with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is widely viewed by the crypto community as an existential threat.All bitcoin will be mined in AmericaIn June in Palm Beach, Florida, about a dozen bitcoin mining executives and experts sat down with Trump for an hour and a half in a small tea room at the Mar-a-Lago Club. The closed-door session marked the first time the former president took a meeting with the technologists securing the $1.5 trillion bitcoin network by running large banks of high-powered machines. The intimate gathering brought together a coalition of some of the biggest private and public American miners in the business, including representatives from Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital Holdings, Terawulf, CleanSpark and Core Scientific. Less than four hours after Trump's roundtable wrapped, the former president took to social media to extol the virtues of the bitcoin mining business. ""Biden's hatred of Bitcoin only helps China, Russia, and the Radical Communist Left. We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!"" Trump posted on Truth Social shortly after his meeting. Since then, Trump has on multiple occasions reiterated the sentiment. ""If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,"" Trump declared in Nashville. ""We will be creating so much electricity that you'll be saying, 'Please, please, President, we don't want any more electricity. We can't stand it!'"" he added.Fed rate cutsIn August, Trump said that, if elected, he would lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve, which guides the country's monetary policy, sets the benchmark rate. It also, by design, operates independently from the White House. Fed Chair Jerome Powell in September decided to slash rates by a half point in its first easing campaign in four years. Rate cuts and the easing of monetary policy historically dovetails with a surge in crypto prices since it makes it cheaper to borrow money.

Elon Musk may already be overstaying his welcome in Trump’s orbit,"Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk speaks as Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. president Donald Trump reacts during a rally at the site of the July assassination attempt against Trump, in Butler, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 5, 2024.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk was handed a major win Tuesday evening when President-elect Donald Trump announced that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO would co-lead a new ""Department of Government Efficiency"" with Vivek Ramaswamy.

The announcement reinforces the closeness that Musk appears to have has managed to achieve with Trump, even after the election. But for some people in Trump's orbit, Musk's presence has felt overbearing.

Musk has been so aggressive in pushing his views about Trump's second term that he's stepping on the toes of Trump's transition team and may be overstaying his welcome at Mar-a-Lago, according to two people familiar with the transition who have spent time at the Palm Beach, Florida, resort over the past week.

The sources said that Musk's near-constant presence at Mar-a-Lago in the week since Election Day had begun to wear on people who've been in Trump's inner circle longer than the tech billionaire and who see him as overstepping his role in the transition. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they're not authorized to speak publicly.

""He's behaving as if he's a co-president and making sure everyone knows it,"" one of the people said of Musk.

""And he's sure taking lots of credit for the president's victory. Bragging about America PAC and X to anyone who will listen. He's trying to make President Trump feel indebted to him. And the president is indebted to no one,"" this person added.

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

In a statement, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, ""Elon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency.""

Musk traveled to Mar-a-Lago to watch the election returns come in last Tuesday night, and he's been there much of the past week, the two sources said. They said Musk is there at all hours, sitting with Trump and joining calls and meetings.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has been involved in sensitive conversations, even before his role in the administration was announced, including briefly joining a phone call last week between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

An adviser to Trump said that Elon Musk would join Trump in a meeting Wednesday with Republican lawmakers ahead of leadership elections.

The second person said that Musk has an ""opinion on and about everything,"" and that he shares them so forcefully that he's begun to pester Trump insiders.

""He wants to be seen as having say in everything (even if he doesn't),"" this source said.

The individual said that some Trump advisers said they were concerned that Musk didn't understand one key to being effective in Trump's world: keeping a low profile. Musk's engagement has been overly aggressive and may hurt his standing in the long run, the source said.

The second source also said that Musk appeared to be pushing his own agenda, instead of focusing on Trump's. They said that while Musk is clearly a smart and capable person, the transition is about ensuring those loyal to Trump will be the ones carrying out government policies.

""Appointing people because they are loyal to Elon doesn't work,"" the source said.

Musk has been among Trump's most energetic supporters. His super PAC spent more than $152 million to elect Trump and other Republican candidates, with much of the money coming from Musk himself. He held rallies for Trump in battleground state Pennsylvania, offered $1 million daily giveaways for registered voters and turned his social media app X into a megaphone for Trump.

In posts on X in the past week, Musk has pushed various policy ideas including deporting immigrants and slashing government spending.

""Very productive day of work by the transition team,"" Musk posted Monday night, in a response to Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, one of the two advisers leading the transition.

Musk has also shared photos from Mar-a-Lago, including a photo with him and the extended Trump family. On Sunday, one of Trump's grandchildren, Kai Trump, posted a photo on X of herself with Musk, writing that Musk was ""achieving uncle status.""

Musk's private jet landed in West Palm Beach, near Mar-a-Lago, last Tuesday and was there for about 24 hours, according to the @ElonJet account on Bluesky that uses publicly available flight data. The plane took off from West Palm Beach last Wednesday and headed to Austin, Texas, where Musk has a home, but then it landed again in West Palm Beach on Friday and has been there for the four days since, according to the account. It's not clear whether Musk was on the jet for every flight.

The relationship between Musk and Trump has been rocky over the years, despite their recent alliance. Musk said in 2022 that Trump should ""hang up his hat & sail into the sunset,"" prompting Trump to hit back at the time that Musk would be ""worthless"" without government subsidies.

There's been intense speculation about the long-term viability of the relationship between Musk and Trump, given the ambitions and personalities of the two men, with many people on social media predicting an eventual falling-out between the two.

But Musk has already gained since the election in one respect: Tesla's share price has risen more than 15% from last Wednesday's opening price, outpacing the 1.8% growth in the S&P 500 over the same time period.",Nov 13 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/elon-musk-may-already-be-overstaying-his-welcome-in-trumps-orbit.html

(Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images)

President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday named Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and military veteran, as his pick for defense secretary.

In a statement, Trump described Hegseth as ""tough, smart and a true believer in America First.""

""With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice — Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,"" Trump said.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., applauded Trump's selection, calling Hegseth a ""great choice.""

""Pete brings a lot to the table. He's got experience, and I think he'll be reform-minded in the areas that need reform. So I'm excited about the pick,"" Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill, without elaborating on what programs he thinks need changing.

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he was caught off guard by Trump's announcement.

""I confess, I did not know who Pete Hegseth was until about 20 minutes ago,"" Smith told reporters.

""He does not seem to have much of a detailed background in [Department of Defense] policy. To the extent he's worked on any of that stuff, it has been on veterans policy, not on DoD issues. So the lack of experience is concerning,"" Smith said.

""Now I have not heard what his plans are, so we will see what his plans are,"" he added. ""But it was surprising and is concerning, just given that lack of experience. You know, the Pentagon, biggest bureaucracy in the world. It's a hard thing to run, so I think it's going to be a challenge.""

During an interview on the podcast ""The Shawn Ryan Show"" released last week, Hegseth denounced what he called diversity, equity and inclusion ""woke s---"" in the military and outlined a plan to ""course correct it.""

""Well, first of all, you gotta fire — you've got to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and obviously, you're going to bring in a new secretary of defense. But any general that was involved — general, admiral, whatever that was involved — in any of the DEI woke s--- has got to go,"" Hegseth said.

During his first administration, Trump nominated James Mattis and later Mark Esper to lead the Defense Department.

Mattis resigned in December 2018 and suggested in a resignation letter that he and Trump differed in their views on ""treating our allies with respect"" and being ""clear-eyed"" about U.S. adversaries and competitors.

Trump fired Esper in 2020 after disagreements that included the use of active-duty troops to quell nationwide racial justice protests that year after the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.

Amid a flurry of picks for his second administration, Trump earlier Tuesday said he would nominate former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to be CIA director.

On Monday, he tapped Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., as his pick for U.N. ambassador and said he would nominate Lee Zeldin, a former House Republican from New York, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sunday, he named immigration hard-liner Tom Homan as his ""border czar.""

As Donald Trump celebrated his presidential victory early Wednesday morning, Elon Musk was right there with him. ""A star is born. Elon,"" Trump said onstage at his Mar-a-Lago resort, thanking the world's richest person for spending two weeks campaigning in Pennsylvania. Musk, who poured at least $130 million into a pro-Trump campaign effort, turned Trump support into yet another full-time job in recent months, funding a swing-state operation to register voters and using his social media platform X to constantly tout his preferred candidate, frequently with misinformation. Musk's investment in Trump is already paying off, even though Trump doesn't take office until Jan. 20. Tesla shares soared 15% on Wednesday, adding roughly $15 billion in paper value to Musk's net worth. The electric vehicle maker faces headwinds in the global market from China-based competitors, declining European sales and consumers' growing distaste for his political views. But with Musk cozying up to Trump, and the president-elect promising to slash the types of regulations that Musk abhors, Wall Street is betting Tesla, on balance, will be a beneficiary. For Musk, the potential gains go well beyond Tesla. During his victory speech, Trump also praised Musk's SpaceX and thanked Musk for delivering Starlink Wi-Fi terminals to Hurricane-stricken parts of the U.S. That all leaves Musk with plenty of reasons to be optimistic that a second Trump administration will pay healthy dividends to him and his businesses.

Musk's companies are currently embroiled in a range of probes and lawsuits from federal agencies pertaining to matters including alleged securities law violations, workplace safety, labor and civil rights violations, violations of federal environmental laws, consumer fraud and vehicle safety defects. Given the executive branch's outsized control over federal regulatory bodies, Musk can look forward to regulators and intelligence agencies winding down some or all of the 19 known ongoing federal investigations and lawsuits against Tesla, SpaceX and X, formerly known as Twitter. At New York's Madison Square Garden on Oct. 27, Musk was one of many Trump fans and surrogates to speak during an all-day rally. Much of the coverage of the event focused on comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's bigoted quips, including his description of Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage."" Musk was introduced by Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who called the Tesla CEO the ""greatest capitalist"" in U.S. history. Lutnick said he and Musk were co-founders of the envisioned ""Department of Government Efficiency"" and he asked Musk how much he thought could be cut from the federal budget.

watch now

Musk answered ""at least $2 trillion,"" which is more than the federal government's discretionary budget of $1.7 trillion. The remark received a scream from Lutnick and applause from the crowd. Musk didn't specify what he sought to cut, but he previously accused agencies including the SEC, Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Aviation Administration of regulatory overreach or infringing on his free speech rights. He also accused the Biden administration of hiring too many IRS personnel, and has vocally objected to a so-called billionaires tax. Having a role in a bespoke commission could give Musk power over federal agencies' budgets, staffing and the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. Musk also said during a Tesla earnings call on Oct. 23, that he intended to use his sway with Trump to establish a ""federal approval process for autonomous vehicles."" Currently, approvals happen at the state level. Tesla has been working on driverless technology for more than a decade but hasn't yet produced a robotaxi or vehicle safe to use without a human ready to steer or brake at any time. Additionally, a Trump administration may agree to ramp up the government's work with his companies. Musk's newest startup, xAI, is developing large language models and generative artificial intelligence software that aims to compete with similar products from Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Meta and others. Meta recently announced its open-source Llama models were available to U.S. government agencies in the areas of defense and national security. And OpenAI is already working with the U.S. military after adding a retired U.S. Army general and former director of the National Security Agency to its board in June. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.

SpaceX's billions in federal contracts

According to research on federal spending and prime contracts by FedScout, SpaceX has received more than $19 billion from contracts with the federal government since 2008, including from NASA, the U.S. Air Force and Space Force. The company is on track to take in several billions of dollars annually from prime contracts with the federal government for years to come, according to FedScout CEO Geoff Orazem. That number doesn't include classified spending, smaller items like Starlink terminals, or spending that's done at the state level via block grants from the federal government, like when the Federal Emergency Management Agency gives states assistance to help recover from natural disasters. Meanwhile, Tesla has reported around $10 billion in sales of ""automotive regulatory credits,"" or environmental credits, since 2015, Orazem found by evaluating the company's financial filings. These incentives are largely derived from federal and state regulations in the U.S. that require automakers to sell some number of low-emission vehicles or buy credits from companies like Tesla, which often have an excess. Regulatory credits were about 60% of Tesla's net income in the second quarter of 2024, and 39% in the third quarter. Other government rebates on EV sales represented about 50% of Tesla's third-quarter profit. Trump hasn't made clear whether he'll maintain those rebates and regulatory credit programs. He previously said he may cut the federal $7,500 EV tax credit. Additionally, Trump has promised to slash income taxes and to implement steep tariffs. While tariffs could help protect Tesla from Chinese competitors, such a move could involve significant disruption to Tesla's automotive supply chain, which relies on some materials and parts from China. When it comes to worker protections, Musk has been seeking to strike down the constitutional authority of the National Labor Relations Board through litigation. He may find such lawsuits are no longer needed if Trump is willing to eliminate or reduce the power of the agency, which is supposed to ensure that companies follow federal laws allowing workers to form unions and engage in collective bargaining with their employers.

Then there's Musk's involvement with sanctioned governments. At SpaceX, Musk has withheld the use of Starlink, the company's satellite internet service, over Taiwan, even for U.S. troops based there. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk cut off access as a favor requested by Russian President Vladimir Putin allegedly on behalf of Chinese President Xi Jinping during a series of ongoing, frequent talks between the two men. In response to the reports, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said if they were true, Musk's conversations with Putin should be be federally investigated. According to analysis by NBC News, Musk has repeatedly posted pro-Kremlin content to his hundreds of millions of followers on X. He even engaged with content from Tenet Media and its creators at least 60 times on the social network. Tenet was at the center of an alleged Russian covert operation to manipulate U.S. public opinion ahead of the 2024 election, according to the Department of Justice. While Vice President-elect JD Vance recently called Putin a U.S. adversary, Trump has frequently spoken of his affection for the Russian president, even since Russia's devastating invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Kremlin officials have celebrated Trump's victory in this week's election. Musk, who publicly endorsed Trump moments after the first assassination attempt on the former president in July, has said he intends to remain involved in U.S. politics for the long haul. He said in a discussion on X on Tuesday that his super PAC would continue its work after the presidential election and would seek to influence the outcomes of midterms, intermediate elections and elections of local prosecutors across the U.S. A priority, Musk said, would be to help elect district attorneys ""who prosecute repeat violent criminals who are obviously a danger to people.""",Nov 7 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/how-elon-musk-stands-to-cash-in-on-trumps-presidential-victory.html

"Trump's legal team tried to keep Stormy Daniels quiet ahead of 2024 election, MSNBC reports","Former President Donald Trump this summer offered a financial incentive to adult film star Stormy Daniels if she agreed to keep quiet about Trump — including about the relationship that became the center of the hush money payments that ended up the subject of a New York criminal trial — ahead of this November's election, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow reported on Wednesday.

Daniels delivered blockbuster testimony earlier this year about hush money payments she received from Trump ahead of the 2016 election, in which she was paid to remain silent about an affair between the two, a relationship he has denied. The jury convicted Trump of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to the payments.

In a case separate from the hush money trial, Daniels was ordered to pay for Trump's legal fees after she lost a defamation suit she filed against him. About two months after the hush money trial, Trump's lawyer told Daniels' representative that the former president would agree to a lower payment if she agreed not to make any disparaging comments about Trump.

""We disagree that a payment of $620,000 would be in full satisfaction of the three judgments,"" Trump's lawyers said in a July letter obtained by Maddow from Daniels' lawyer.

""However, we can agree to settle these matters for $620,000, provided that your client agrees in writing to make no public or private statements related to any alleged past interactions with President Trump, or defamatory or disparaging statements about him, his businesses and/or any affiliates or his suitability as a candidate for President,"" the letter continued.",Oct 17 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/17/trumps-legal-team-tried-to-keep-stormy-daniels-quiet-ahead-of-2024-election-msnbc-reports.html?__source=appletv%7Cproqrcode%7Cfeatured
"Harris vs. Trump: Auto insiders weigh in on both candidates, top issues","New Ford F-150 trucks go through the assembly line at the Ford Dearborn Plant on April 11, 2024 in Dearborn, Michigan. Bill Pugliano | Getty Images

DETROIT — The automotive industry has become a crucial topic during the 2024 presidential election as Michigan — home of the Motor City and 1.1 million automotive jobs — remains a critical swing state. Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump, and their running mates and supporters have made Michigan a second home in recent weeks as the campaigns attempt to win over undecided voters in the Great Lakes State. Since 2008, whichever candidate has won the state has moved into the White House, including Trump in 2016 and President Joe Biden in 2020. ""Michigan's 16 electoral votes have helped thrust Autos into the debate. Between Trump's hyperactive and contradictory statements and Harris' quieter views lay deep differences but also convergence,"" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in an investor note Monday. While major automakers and suppliers have shied away from publicly endorsing either presidential candidate, executives and lobbyists from several companies spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity to discuss how they're preparing for each candidate, as well as a likely divided Congress. Electric vehicles, trade, tariffs, China, emissions regulations and labor are among the top issues automakers are monitoring, according to industry executives and policy experts.

Harris vs. Trump

Officials expect a Harris victory to be a continuation, but not a copy, of the past four years under Biden. They think she would potentially be more understanding of businesses, but there are concerns. Some of her policies and potential appointments are unclear, experts said, and her alignment with the United Auto Workers, particularly union President Shawn Fain who has been a combative foe to automakers, is concerning to some.

If Trump wins reelection, automotive industry officials largely expect that he'll return to policies and actions from his first presidential term, but those stances could be potentially more aggressive than they were before. If he's in office, insiders expect he would roll back or eliminate tightening federal emissions and fuel economy like he did during his first term; renew a battle between California and other states that set their own standards; and potentially enact funding changes to the Biden administration's key Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 legislation. Officials said it would be difficult for Trump to completely gut the IRA, but he could defund or limit EV subsidies through executive orders or other policy actions. Automakers, suppliers and other auto-related companies are preparing for both outcomes as well as a split in Congress, insiders said.

""There's no perfect scenario. Both candidates offer some opportunities and challenges,"" said a leading lobbyist and public policy expert for a major automaker. ""Everyone in our business has to look at the gamut of scenarios."" Some Wall Street analysts speculate legacy automakers — specifically the ""Detroit"" companies General Motors , Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis — would benefit most with Trump and Republican control of Congress. EV startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group would benefit more with a Democratic win, largely due to expected plans involving EVs and fuel economy requirements. That's despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk's continued support for Trump.

Emissions regulations

The most imminent issues for automakers are fuel economy and emissions regulations, specifically regarding 2026 model year regulations for California and several states that follow them such as Washington, Oregon and New York. Current requirements under the ""Advanced Clean Cars II"" regulations of 2022 call for 35% of 2026 model year vehicles, which will begin to be introduced next year, to be zero-emission vehicles. Battery-electric, fuel cell and, to an extent, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles qualify as zero emission. The California Air Resources Board reports 12 states and Washington, D.C., have adopted the rules; however, roughly half have them starting for the 2027 model year. They are part of CARB's Advanced Clean Cars regulations that include mandating 100% of new vehicle sales be zero-emission models by 2035.

Only 11 states and the District of Columbia had an EV market share above 10% to begin this year, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association and lobby group that represents most major automakers operating in the U.S. Officials said regardless of who wins the White House, many automakers will push for the CARB mandates to be postponed. They also would expect Trump to roll back or freeze the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards for model years 2027-2031. Several automotive insiders said they expect Harris would work on a middle ground for such standard with the automakers, much like Biden, to an extent, has done.

EVs, IRA

Electric vehicles and the U.S. policies supporting them, such as the Inflation Reduction Act, are top of mind for automotive industry executives and lobbyists. There could be major changes in regulations and incentives for EVs if Trump regains power, which has placed the industry in a temporary limbo. ""Depending on the election in the U.S., we may have mandates; we may not,"" Volkswagen Group of America CEO Pablo Di Si said Sept. 24 during an Automotive News event. ""Am I going to make any decisions on future investments right now? Obviously not. We're waiting to see.""

Electric vehicles transformed from a popular talking point for Democrats four years ago to a rallying call for Republicans. Republicans, led by Trump, have largely condemned EVs, saying that they are being forced upon consumers and that they will ruin the U.S. automotive industry. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency and incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles. In contrast, Democrats, including Harris, have historically supported EVs and related incentives. Harris hasn't been as vocal about backing EVs lately amid slower-than-expected consumer adoption of the vehicles and consumer pushback. She has said she does not support an EV mandate such as the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act of 2019, which she co-sponsored during her time as a senator, that would have required automakers to sell only electrified vehicles by 2040. Lucid Group CEO Peter Rawlinson told CNBC on Monday that regardless of which presidential candidate wins the election, he believes America's EV industry is still in its infancy and needs to continue to be ""nurtured."" Rawlinson, whose company has the most efficient EVs on sale, also argues the IRA should favor not just the size of a battery, like it currently does, but the efficiency of the vehicles. ""That's effectively incentivizing electron-guzzling EVs,"" he said. ""It actually incentivized to put more batteries in and be less efficient.""

Trade/tariffs and China

Led by fears of China's automotive industry expanding globally, both Trump and Harris have expressed intentions to review the U.S. North American trade deal, formally known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The deal, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, was negotiated under Trump's first term in office and took effect in 2020. However, the former president and Democrats have said it needs to be improved to better support American automotive production. While Trump touted the deal when it was renegotiated, Harris was one of 10 U.S. senators who voted against USMCA at the time. GM CEO Mary Barra last week said the automaker is ""paying careful attention"" to the election, including how potential changes in trade and tariffs could impact the company. ""We have and we'll continue to engage constructively with the policymaking process regardless of the election outcome. When you look at the number of jobs created in the U.S., even with some vehicles that are manufactured outside, a lot of them are in our partners from an ally perspective,"" she said. ""It's a very complex situation."" Tariffs are central to Trump's plan for the auto industry. He has said he would be willing to increase tariffs dramatically to prevent Chinese automakers from importing cars into the U.S. from factories in Mexico. Chinese automakers are not currently doing that, but are expected to attempt to use that method of importing in the years ahead, as they expand sales and build localized production plants in the country.

watch now

Harris has reportedly called Trump's tariff proposals ""a sales tax on the American people."" The vice president hasn't outlined any specific changes she'd make to the current tariff structure if elected, including on Biden's announcement of raising the tariff rate on EVs imported from China from 25% to 100%. Non-U.S.-based automakers, which together account for 48% of U.S. production and 52% of USMCA production, look more positively leveraged to Harris winning, according to Jefferies.

Labor

Of the many issues regarding the automotive industry, officials who spoke to CNBC were nearly unanimous regarding labor: They're concerned a Harris win would continue to mean increased power for organized labor. Biden, followed by Harris, gave the United Auto Workers and Fain — the union's president — more spotlight than any previous presidents in modern times, including a speech at the Democratic National Convention. The UAW arguably has more political clout than any time in a generation, led by Fain and his top advisors who he brought in from outside the union's ranks. But there has been a divide in the UAW and other unions regarding the historically Democratic-backed organizations and their members.",Oct 29 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/harris-trump-auto-industry-michigan.html
McDonald's tells U.S. restaurants it's not a 'political brand' after Trump visit,"Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump works behind the counter during a visit to McDonalds in Feasterville-Trevose, Pennsylvania, U.S. October 20, 2024.

Though President Donald Trump visited a Pennsylvania McDonald's location on Sunday, the fast-food giant is trying to stay neutral in the presidential race.

""As we've seen, our brand has been a fixture of conversation in this election cycle. While we've not sought this, it's a testament to how much McDonald's resonates with so many Americans. McDonald's does not endorse candidates for elected office and that remains true in this race for the next President,"" the company said in an internal message viewed by CNBC and confirmed by a source familiar with the matter.

Trump learned how to operate a fry cooker and work the drive-thru line during his short shift at a Feasterville, Pennsylvania, restaurant. He used the stunt as an opportunity to take more shots at his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.

Trump often accuses Harris of lying about working at McDonald's for a summer in her 20s, but has offered no proof backing up the claim. Harris has denied the accusation. McDonald's and its franchisees don't have all of their employment records for workers dating back to the early 1980s, when the 60-year-old Harris would have worked there, the company said in the Sunday memo.

""Though we are not a political brand, we've been proud to hear former President Trump's love for McDonald's and Vice President Harris's fond memories working under the Arches,"" McDonald's said.

Both McDonald's and the franchisee who operates the location emphasized that the chain opens its doors to ""everyone.""",Oct 21 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/mcdonalds-says-its-not-political-after-trump-visit.html

The total bill for ad spending in the 2024 election hit almost $11 billion, a new record and a substantial increase from the $9 billion spent in 2020. That's according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political ad spending. The total is in line with the firm's 2023 projection that 2024 would see more ad spending than ever before.

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Source: AdImpact data from Jan. 1, 2023, to Nov. 5, 2024

The largest share of the spending, unsurprisingly, came from the presidential race, where Democrats outspent Republicans despite losing the campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris' political operation spent more than $880 million since the start of 2023 (including spending when President Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket, as well as joint fundraising committees aligned with the campaign and the Democratic National Committee). President-elect Donald Trump's political operation, including his campaign, the national party and affiliated joint fundraising committees, spent about $425 million on ads. Overall, the Democratic campaign and pro-Democratic outside groups spent almost $1.8 billion, while the Trump campaign and pro-Republican outside groups spent $1.4 billion.

Trump expected to choose Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state,"Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) speaks on Day 2 of the Republican National Convention (RNC), at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S., July 16, 2024.

President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida for secretary of state in his administration in the coming days, according to three sources familiar with the selection process.

Trump could still change his mind, the sources cautioned, noting that the decision wouldn't be finalized until he makes a formal announcement.

The New York Times first reported Trump's plans to select Rubio to be the country's top diplomat.

Foreign policy is one of the few areas in which there is a deep philosophical disagreement among Trump's base.

A main pitch from Trump during the campaign was that he would implement ""America First"" policies, a doctrine that emphasizes less foreign aid, trying to curtail U.S. involvement in current foreign conflicts and avoiding future ones. But there remains a different strain of foreign policy thinking among even prominent Trump supporters.

Even though Rubio is an avowed Trump supporter, the perception is that he was one of the ""less MAGA"" options, a Trump ally told NBC News. It's a position that requires appealing enough to Trump's more isolationist political base but also carrying water for the less disruptive brand of foreign policy that those Trump backers generally oppose.

""While Marco is a little more hawkish than the incoming president and vice president, he's actually not as far away from them as many people might assume at first blush,"" another Trump ally said. ""He's become far more aligned with the president on issues regarding tariffs. He has a similar stand on the China issue, and he even voted against the last round of Ukraine funding.""

A current senior administration official told NBC News that Rubio would be a ""serious"" and ""qualified"" choice. The person said picking Rubio would be a relief given reporting that Ric Grenell, the highly controversial ambassador to Germany during Trump's first term, was also in the mix. Multiple career diplomats said they were concerned about the State Department's becoming politicized if Grenell were nominated.

During the last Trump administration, the number of diplomats in senior ranks at the State Department plummeted, at first through voluntary departures soon after his election and later through attrition as the authority of their positions was redirected to political appointees.

Trump had considered Rubio as a running mate before he ultimately chose Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.

If Rubio becomes secretary of state, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would get to choose a replacement. That pick would serve until at least 2026, when an election would be held for the seat.

Trump has made a series of other staffing announcements in recent days. On Monday, he announced plans to nominate former Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., as the Environmental Protection Agency's top administrator and to appoint Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., as his national security adviser.

Last week, he said Susie Wiles, his campaign manager, would be White House chief of staff. On Sunday, he named immigration hard-liner Tom Homan as his ""border czar.""",Nov 11 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/trump-expected-to-choose-sen-marco-rubio-for-secretary-of-state.html
Trump doubles down on replacing income taxes with tariffs in Joe Rogan interview,"Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump gives remarks on border security inside an airplane hanger at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on October 25, 2024 in Austin, Texas.

Former President Donald Trump stood by his idea to end income taxes and substitute them with tariffs in a Friday interview with Joe Rogan, the host of one of the most widely listened to podcasts in the world.

""Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?"" Rogan asked the Republican presidential nominee during their three-hour interview. ""We're serious about that?""

""Yeah, sure, but why not?"" Trump responded.

""We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families, unless they pay a big price. And the big price is tariffs,"" the former president added.

A central piece of Trump's economic pitch to voters is an extensive tax overhaul that includes proposals to erode the income tax system and replace it with a hardline tariff policy.

He has floated eliminating income taxes on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits, along with renewing his 2017 tax cuts, which are due to expire in 2025. He has also said he would consider income tax exemptions for firefighters, police officers, military personnel and veterans.

Ending taxes on tipped income, overtime and Social Security alone would cost an estimated $2 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan think tank Tax Foundation. That cost only grows with the addition of Trump's other tax exemption proposals.

Trump sees his aggressive tariff policy vision as a way to offset those costs.

He has proposed a 20% tariff on all imports from all countries across the board, with an especially high rate for Chinese imports.

But tax experts and economic analysts do not think Trump's tariffs would be an adequate counterweight to balance the trillions lost from eliminating income taxes.

""It would not be possible to raise tariffs rates high enough to cover anywhere close to that amount [of income tax revenue], as imports would decline as the tariff rates increased,"" Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, told CNBC earlier this month.

Watson added that Trump's tariffs would likely generate an estimated $3.8 trillion in revenue over 10 years compared with the $33 trillion that individual income taxes would bring in over the same period.

On balance, Trump's overall tax plan including tariffs would expand the deficit by $3 trillion over a decade.

""The math doesn't work out,"" Watson said.

Further, Trump's tariffs would get paid by U.S. importers, which would increase producer costs and could result in higher consumer prices, just as inflation has begun to cool.

In effect, Trump's tax strategy relies on replacing income taxes with a kind of new sales tax, shifting the tax burden more heavily onto low-income individuals, which Vice President Kamala Harris has used as her own campaign talking point.

""It would be a sales tax on the American people,"" the Democratic nominee said in an interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle in September.

Trump rejected that characterization in a Thursday Truth Social post by falsely claiming that tariffs were ""paid for by the abusing country."" Tariffs, or import taxes, are paid for by U.S. importers.

The Harris campaign dug in on its attack in a Saturday memo.

""Thou doth protest too much, Mr. Trump,"" senior Harris campaign adviser Ian Sams wrote. ""Independent experts have found Trump's plan would be essentially a 'Trump Tax' on middle class Americans.""",Oct 26 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/26/trump-joe-rogan-election-tariffs-income-tax-replace.html
Britain loves its 'special relationship' with the U.S. — but that doesn't mean Trump will love it back,"A man holds an American flag depicting president-elect Donald Trump at Parliament Square in London. Jeff J Mitchell | Getty Images News | Getty Images

The U.K. holds dear to its so-called ""special relationship"" with the U.S., priding itself on a long history of shared values and cultural, diplomatic, linguistic and commercial ties with the States. London feels those long-standing bonds and geopolitical interests make its relationship with the U.S., well, special. Whether that feeling of exceptionalism and unique closeness is appreciate or felt as keenly across the Atlantic has always been a bone of contention for London, however, and the bond between the U.S. and U.K. could be tested further when Donald Trump returns to the White House following his election win. In the run-up to the vote, Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer had looked to strengthen the relationship with Trump, checking in on the Republican leader after an assassination attempt against him, and traveling to New York with Foreign Secretary David Lammy to dine with him at Trump Tower in September. Congratulating the president-elect on his decisive win, Starmer posted on X that he looked forward to a collaborative partnership with Trump ""As the closest of allies, we stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of our shared values of freedom, democracy and enterprise,"" he commented, adding, ""From growth and security to innovation and tech, I know that the U.K.-U.S. special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come."" Still, Starmer might have some groveling to do with a new Trump administration. Tensions flared last month when Trump's campaign team in October accused the Labour Party of ""blatant foreign interference"" in the presidential election after party activists travelled to the U.S. to help Harris' campaign. Starmer and the party denied the accusations.

There's no doubt that the leaders are cut from different cloths — the brash and unpredictable character of businessman-turned-politician Trump is a far cry from the more measured style of the former human rights lawyer who once took on big business in high-profile court cases. Addressing British lawmakers on Wednesday, Starmer reacted to Trump's win by reaffirming his commitment to good relations with the U.S., stating ""it is absolutely crucial that we have a strong relationship, that strong special relationship forged in difficult circumstances, between the U.S. and the U.K."" But Kemi Badenoch, the new leader of Britain's opposition Conservative Party, which is more ideologically aligned with the Republicans, goaded Starmer over past criticism of Trump by the current Labour foreign minister who, in 2018, called Trump a ""woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath"" and a ""profound threat to the international order"" in a magazine article. Lammy has since said he would work with Trump and would look to persuade the infamously NATO-skeptic Republican to remain in the military alliance.

The UK can lie low

Economists say Britain should not expect any special treatment when a new Trump administration comes into force, but they note it's unlikely the U.K would be a prime target for punitive policies, such as import tariffs, that could be levied on the European Union and China as Trump looks to boost America's growth and competitiveness.

watch now

Trump has already threatened to revive a trade war that began during his first term in office, stating in his election campaign that he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods by 60-100%, and would impose a blanket 10% tariff (or potentially 20%) on all U.S. imports, a move opening up a new front in trade tensions with two of its largest trading partners, the EU and China. The U.K., now outside the European bloc, might find its post-Brexit position an advantage. ""The U.K. is, quite frankly, probably small enough to be off the radar,"" Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, told CNBC after Trump's election win. ""We're not part of the EU anymore. China and the EU are the big two [that will be targeted by Trump]. We won't come into any issues around NATO commitments, because we meet our own. Whereas with Europe, Trump could conceivably say, 'we'll threaten you with a trade war, but if you increase your military spend and meet your NATO commitments, we'll not put tariffs on,'"" Pickering said, noting that ""Trump likes to trade everything off."" While ""Starmer may have offended Trump at some point, or David Lammy might have offended America,"" Pickering noted that ""these are relatively small potatoes versus Trump's issues with Europe and NATO or China containment. So I think with a bit of careful diplomacy, the U.K. and the U.S. can get on good terms quickly,"" he said.

Not so special anymore

Describing the ""special relationship"" as one of convenience for the U.S., Pickering said the U.K. could still maneuver itself to be useful to an incoming Trump government. ""The key thing for the U.K. is, can it reassert itself as this mid-Atlantic broker between America and Europe now that it's outside of the EU? This was always the U.K.'s advantage — to be the English speaking common-law, American partner within the European Union, and by brokering that relationship, that allowed us to punch above our weight diplomatically."" Whisper it, but the ""special relationship"" ceased to be special long ago, according to Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg. ""Apart from strong cooperation on intelligence gathering and few military aspects, all recent U.S. administrations have treated the U.K. as a normal mid-size European country,"" Schmieding told CNBC Wednesday. ""That Trump and Starmer are apparently not fans of each other, to put it mildly, will not help in future U.S.-U.K. talks. But it is not the decisive factor, largely because for the U.S. will probably not be inclined to give any special treatment to any country in Europe,"" he said.

Here's what President-elect Trump's tariff plan may mean for your wallet,"President-elect Donald Trump won Tuesday's presidential election partly by addressing Americans' economic anxieties over higher prices. Nearly half of all voters said they were worse off financially than they were four years ago, the highest level in any election since 2008, according to an NBC News exit poll. But a cornerstone of Trump's economic policy — sweeping new tariffs on imported goods — would likely exacerbate the very Biden-era inflation Trump lambasted on the campaign trail, according to economists. There's still much uncertainty around how and when such tariffs might be implemented. If they were to take effect, they would likely raise prices for American consumers and disproportionately hurt lower earners, economists said. The typical U.S. household would pay several thousand more dollars each year on clothing, furniture, appliances and other goods, estimates suggest.

""It's bad for consumers,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. ""It's a tax on consumers in the form of higher prices for imported goods."" ""It's inflationary,"" he added. He and other economists predict the proposed tariffs would also lead to job loss and slower economic growth, on a net basis. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC on the impact of tariffs or their scope.

How Trump's tariff proposal might work

How much tariffs cost consumers

A 20% worldwide tariff and a 60% levy on Chinese goods would raise costs by $3,000 in 2025 for the average U.S. household, according to an October analysis by the Tax Policy Center. Trump's plan would reduce average after-tax incomes by almost 3%, according to the tax think tank. Additionally, a 200% Mexico-vehicle tariff would increase household costs by an average $600, TPC said. American consumers would lose $46 billion to $78 billion a year in spending power on apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to a National Retail Federation analysis published Monday. ""I feel pretty confident saying [tariffs] are a price-raising policy,"" said Mike Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics. ""The question is just the magnitude.""

The reason for these higher costs: Tariffs are paid by U.S. companies that import goods. The ""vast majority"" of that additional cost is passed on to American consumers, while only some of it is paid for by U.S. distributors and retailers or by foreign producers, said Zandi of Moody's. Philip Daniele, president and CEO of AutoZone, alluded to this dynamic in a recent earnings call. ""If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,"" Daniele said in September. The U.S. imported about $3.2 trillion of goods in 2022, for example, said Olivia Cross, a North America economist at Capital Economics. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests a 10% across-the-board tariff would be roughly equivalent to a $320 billion tax on consumers, Cross said.

Tariffs reduce economic growth and jobs

Of course, the financial fallout likely wouldn't be quite that large, Cross said. Trump's plan could boost the strength of the U.S. dollar, and there may also be tariff exemptions for certain categories of goods or imports from certain countries, all of which would likely blunt the overall impact, Cross said.

watch now

A 20% universal tariff and 60% Chinese import tax would also generate about $4.5 trillion in net new revenue for the federal government over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center. ""The administration could take tariff revenue and redistribute to households via tax cuts in some form or another,"" explained Pugliese of Wells Fargo. Trump has proposed various tax breaks on the campaign trail. Additionally, tax cuts enacted by Trump in 2017 are due to expire next year, and tariff revenue may potentially be used to extend them, should Congress pass such legislation, economists said. However, the typical U.S. household would still lose $2,600 a year from Trump's tariff plan, even after accounting for an extension of the 2017 tax cuts, according to an analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",Nov 6 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/here-what-president-elect-trumps-tariff-plan-may-mean-for-your-wallet.html 
Social Security's retirement trust fund may run out in nine years. Here's how the next U.S. president may address that,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are shown on screen during a debate watch party at the Cameo Art House Theatre in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Sept. 10, 2024.

With the Social Security Administration facing a looming funding crisis over the next decade, it's clear that the next U.S. president — either Democratic candidate Kamala Harris or Republican candidate Donald Trump — is poised to inherit a Social Security dilemma. Almost 68 million Americans receive Social Security payments every month. The benefits support seniors in their retirement, disabled Americans and survivors of beneficiaries, but the future of the Social Security Administration has been in jeopardy for years. More than 11,200 Americans are now turning 65 every day. As more retirees start to claim Social Security, there are not enough workers contributing to the program to make up for that increase in benefit payments. When such a shortfall happens, Social Security turns to its trust funds — money that is set aside to help pay for benefits and other administrative costs. But the trust fund Social Security relies on to pay retirement benefits is projected to be depleted in 2033. At that time, just 79% of benefits may be payable, according to the program's trustees. The average retired worker would see about a $403 cut to their current average monthly benefit of $1,920. Most Americans rank Social Security as ""one of the top"" or a ""very important"" issue that will help determine how they vote in November, a recent CNBC poll found.

watch now

Both presidential candidates — former president Trump and Vice President Harris — have vowed to protect Social Security benefits through their campaign platforms. But restoring the program's solvency will require changes — benefit cuts, tax increases or a combination of both. Yet some experts say the candidates' discussions have thus far avoided specific details on how to address that shortfall. ""We're not seeing anyone step up and say, 'In nine years, our main retirement program is looking at the trust of being insolvent, and that could lead to roughly a 20% benefit cut across the board of everybody,"" said Jason Fichtner, chief economist at the Bipartisan Policy Center and executive director of the Alliance for Lifetime Income's Retirement Income Institute.

Trump promises no taxes on Social Security benefits

On the campaign trail, Trump has touted an idea aimed at letting retirees keep more of their Social Security checks — ending taxes on benefits. ""Seniors should not pay tax on Social Security,"" Trump wrote on July 31 in all capital letters on social media platform Truth Social. A recent ABC News/Ipsos poll found 85% of voters support the idea. Trump's campaign platform promises to ""fight for and protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts, including no changes to the retirement age."" However, in a March CNBC interview, Trump said he would consider cutting ""entitlements,"" a term that may refer to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. ""There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and bad management of entitlements,"" Trump told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" Currently, retirees pay federal income taxes on up to 85% of their Social Security benefits, depending on their incomes. Just how much taxes retirees pay on benefits is based on a formula called combined income, the sum of adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest and half of Social Security benefits. Married couples may pay taxes on up to 50% of their benefits if their combined incomes are between $32,000 and $44,000. If their incomes are over $44,000, up to 85% of their benefits may be taxable. Individuals may be liable for taxes on up to 50% of their benefits if their incomes are between $25,000 and $34,000. If they have more than $34,000 in income, up to 85% of their benefits are taxable. Because those thresholds do not change from year to year, more beneficiaries are paying taxes on their benefit income over time. Ending taxes on Social Security benefits would move the insolvency date of Social Security's trust fund closer by over one year, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

House may force vote on bill affecting pensioners' Social Security benefits

72% of Americans worry Social Security will run out in their lifetime And it may not make a big difference in retirees' budgets, according to Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The median household income for retirees is about $50,000, so the ""vast majority"" pay very little or nothing in taxes on their Social Security benefits, Gleckman said. Exempting taxes on benefits would mostly help those with incomes between $63,000 and $200,000, the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center's research found. But while the top 20% of households would see an average tax cut of about $1,400 after the elimination of the taxes on Social Security benefits, Gleckman explained, they would see an average tax increase of $6,500 with Trump's plans to impose tariffs on imports. ""The net effect of what Trump is trying to do, if you look at everything including the tariffs, is probably increased taxes on retirees, even if they do get some benefit from repealing the tax on Social Security benefits,"" Gleckman said. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Harris wants 'wealthiest Americans' to 'pay their fair share'

The Harris campaign's economic plan promises to ""shore up Social Security and Medicare so that these essential programs will stay solvent in the long run by making corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes."" In budget proposals and during the State of the Union, President Joe Biden has likewise called for having high earners pay more into the program. More specific details on how Democratic candidate Harris would restore solvency to the program as president were not available by press time. Employers and employees each pay 6.2% of wages to Social Security up to a taxable maximum (self-employed individuals pay 12.4%). In 2024, the limit on earnings that are subject to the Social Security payroll tax is $168,600. Top earners with $1 million in gross annual wage income stopped paying into the program as of March 2, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Washington Democrats have proposed reapplying those taxes for earnings over $400,000 or $250,000 in separate proposals, while also potentially raising taxes on investment income. Those tax increases would improve the program's solvency, while also making certain benefit increases possible, per the proposals. If Harris holds to the $400,000 threshold set by the Biden administration, her Social Security proposal would have ""no impact on the vast majority of households,"" according to Gleckman, since around 95% to 98% of households make that amount or less. ""Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are fighting to lower costs and will always protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare,"" campaign spokeswoman Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement.

Trump names former House Democrat Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence,"Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (R-HI) takes the stage during a Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump campaign rally at Lancaster Airport on November 03, 2024 in Lititz, Pennsylvania.

President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he will nominate Tulsi Gabbard, a former House Democrat who became a high-profile Trump supporter, to be director of national intelligence.

""For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and Freedoms of all Americans,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!""

In her own statement Wednesday, Gabbard said she was grateful for the chance to ""defend the safety, security and freedom of the American people"" as a member of Trump's cabinet.

""I look forward to getting to work,"" she added.

Gabbard announced shortly before the midterm elections in 2022 that she was leaving the Democratic Party, which she accused in a video statement at the time of ""actively working to undermine our God-given freedoms enshrined in our Constitution.""

In August, she endorsed Trump, began working as a co-chair for his transition team and helped him prepare for his debate against Vice President Kamala Harris. Last month she formally announced last month that she would join the Republican Party.

Gabbard previously ran for the Democratic nomination during the 2020 presidential race, ending her presidential campaign in March 2020 to endorse Joe Biden.

Before campaigning for president, Gabbard served in the House from 2013 to 2021 and was vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 2013 to 2016. She is a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and has served as an army veteran who was deployed to the Middle East and Africa.

If confirmed, Gabbard will be the first person of color to hold the position, which was created under then-President George W. Bush.

Gabbard has been widely criticized for her 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who had been accused of human rights violations and war crimes. She defended the meeting, telling MNSBC News at the time, ""We've got to be able to be willing to meet with whoever we need to if there is a possibility, and a chance that that can help us take steps forward towards peace.""

What Trump's mass deportation plan would mean for immigrant workers and the economy,"Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump visits the U.S.-Mexico border at Eagle Pass, Texas, as seen from Piedras Negras, Mexico, February 29, 2024.

President-elect Donald J. Trump won the White House based partly on his promises to rein in immigration, with targeted policies that range from sending criminals to their home countries to more sweeping ones like mass deportations. During the campaign, Trump pledged to end the Temporary Protected Status that allows workers from select countries to come to the U.S. to work. If some of the larger deportation efforts, like rolling back TPS, come to fruition, experts say that there will be ripple effects felt in most sectors of the economy, in particular construction, housing and agriculture.

On Sunday night, Trump announced in a social media post that Tom Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will be his administration's ""border czar."" Homan had said at a conservative conference earlier this year ""No one's off the table. If you're here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder."" He vowed to ""run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen.""

Economists and labor specialists are most worried about the economic impact of policies that would deport workers already in the U.S., both documented and undocumented.

Staffing agencies were watching the election especially closely.

""The morning after the election, we sat down as a leadership team and explored what does this mean for talent availability?"" said Jason Leverant, president and COO of the AtWork Group, a franchise-based national staffing agency. AtWork provides commercial staffing in immigrant-heavy verticals like warehouses, industrial, and agriculture in 39 states.

Workers – ""talent"" in industry parlance – are already in short supply. While the worst of the labor crisis spurred by the post-Covid economic boom has passed, and labor supply and demand has come back into balance in recent months, the number of workers available to fill jobs across the U.S. economy remains a closely watched data point. Mass deportation would exacerbate this economic issue, say employers and economists.

""If the proposed immigration policies come into reality, there could be a significant impact,"" Leverant said, pointing to estimates that a mass deportation program could leave as many as one million difficult-to-fill potential job openings.

How many undocumented immigrants work in the U.S.

There are various statistics offered up about the undocumented immigrant population in the United States. The left-leaning Center for American Progress puts the number at around 11.3 million, with 7 million of them working. The American Immigration Council, an advocacy group in favor of expanding immigration, citing data from an American Community Survey, also puts the number of undocumented people in the United States around 11 million. The non-partisan Pew Research Center puts the number at closer to 8 million people.

""There are millions, many millions who are undocumented who are in the trades; we don't have the Americans to do the work,"" said Chad Prinkey, the CEO of Well Built Construction Consulting, which works with construction companies. ""We need these workers; what we all want is for them to be documented; we want to know who they are, where they are, and make sure they are paying taxes; we don't want them gone.""

Leverant says it is still being determined how jobs lost from a mass deportation would be filled.

""Do we pull talent from one area to another, but then someone else loses it,"" Leverant said. ""This is pretty significant and we have to stay ahead of it.""

Leverant says he is not concerned about losing any of the 20,000 workers AtWork sends to various places because document status is strenuously checked, but if other companies lose workers, they will be leaning even more heavily on staffing agencies like AtWork for talent that is already in short supply. And supply and demand dictate worker wages, which will be forced upwards. And that will ripple throughout the supply chain right into the supermarket or sporting goods store.

""We are playing the long game now, the pain will be felt and we will see shortages, and slow-downs and delays on every front,"" he said.

Produce not making it to market because there are not enough workers to bring it to distribution, or delayed construction projects, are among likely outcomes from limited labor supply.

Worries about workforce extend to skilled labor, tech

There are also concerns about how stricter immigration policy could negatively impact skilled workers.

""This is more than low-skilled labor; this ripples into tech workers and engineers. We don't have enough skilled talent there either to fill the jobs,"" Leverant said, adding that he is not envisioning doctors and scientists being rounded up and deported, but restrictions on H-1B visas and a generally more unwelcoming atmosphere could deter talent from coming.

Janeesa Hollingshead, head of expansion at Uber Works, an on-demand staffing arm of the ride-share company, agrees tech will be impacted, if past is prologue.

""The tech industry relies heavily on immigrants to fill highly technical, crucial roles,"" Hollingshead said, recalling that Uber informed all tech workers on H-1B visas during Trump's first presidency that if they went to their home countries for holidays, they may not be able to return.

According to the American Immigration Council, during the first Trump administration, the government's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied a larger percentage of H-1B petitions than in the preceding four years, but many of the denials were overturned, leading to a lower level of denials by fiscal 2020, 13%, versus 24% in 2018. Fiscal years 2021and 2022 had the lowest denial rates ever recorded.

Hollingshead says that tech companies in the United States are going to be forced to find tech talent from currently overlooked pools of people already in the country.

""U.S. companies are going to need to figure out how to do this or face an even more dire labor shortage,"" Hollingshead says.

At his Madison Square Garden rally in New York right before the election, Trump said: ""On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out.""

""I would not write off his mass deportation process as rhetoric. We have to assume he means what he says,"" according to David Leopold, chair of the immigration practice group at law firm U.B. Greensfelder.

Still, despite the impact that could churn through the labor market, in practice, the mass deportations might be difficult to pull off.

""It is very expensive to remove 11 million people,"" Leopold said, predicting that Trump will use ICE and federal agencies but also lean on local law enforcement to round up immigrants.

In a phone interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker shortly after the election results, Trump invoked the darker rhetoric on migrants that proved successful during the campaign while saying he isn't opposed to people coming into the country — in fact, he said more people will be required if his administration's strategy of requiring businesses to set up operations within the U.S. is successful. ""We want people to come in,"" Trump said. ""We're gonna have a lot of businesses coming into our country. They want to come into our country. ... We want companies and factories and plants and automobile factories to come into our country, and they will be coming. And therefore we need people, but we want people that aren't necessarily sitting in a jail because they murdered seven people.""

The American Immigration Council estimates that in a longer-term mass deportation operation targeting one million people per year — which it said reflects ""more conservative proposals"" made by mass-deportation proponents — the cost would average out to $88 billion annually, for a total cost of $967.9 billion over the course of more than a decade.

In his interview with NBC News, Trump dismissed concerns about cost. ""It's not a question of a price tag,"" he said. ""We have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here. ... there is no price tag,"" Trump said.

Leopold says depending in the severity of the plan, changes could reach consumers in the form of increasing prices, supply problems, and restricted access to goods and services.

Construction and housing damage

Nan Wu, research director of the American Immigration Council, echoes the concerns of others in predicting turmoil for consumers if deportations tick upward under Trump.

""Mass deportation would exacerbate ongoing U.S. labor shortages, especially in industries that rely heavily on undocumented immigrant workers,"" Wu said, citing AIC's research that shows the construction industry would lose one in eight workers, citing AIC""s research that 14 percent of construction workers in the United States are undocumented.

""The removal of so many workers within a short period would push up construction costs and lead to delays in building new homes, making housing even less affordable in many parts of the country,"" Wu said.

The same, she says, applies to the agriculture industry which would also see a loss of one in eight workers.

""Looking at specific occupations, about one-quarter of farm workers, agricultural graders, and sorters are undocumented workers. Losing the agricultural workers who grow, pick, and pack our food would hurt domestic food production and raise food prices,"" Wu said.

Figures from the USDA put the number of undocumented farm workers at 41 percent in 2018, the most recent year figures are available, with California having the highest number.

The AIC estimates that the U.S. GDP would shrink by $1.1 trillion to $1.7 trillion.

Conservative think tank American Compass argues for a ""skills-based immigration policy"" which it says would require ""serious immigration enforcement that prevents people from working illegally. Such enforcement will need to deal prospectively with the future flow of immigrants as well as grapple with the millions of illegal workers already here,"" it stated in a policy brief.

Among its policy priorities are mandatory use of the E-Verify system by all employers, along with severe criminal penalties for repeated or willful violations; short-term work permits available to illegal immigrants who have already been in the country for a significant period of time — but with establishment of a timeline for when they must leave the country based on how long they've already been residing in it; and for those who have resided in U.S. for the longest, the ability to obtain permanent legal status after paying a substantial fine.

Homan said in a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview that ""work-site enforcement operations"" — he rejected the use of the word ""raids"" — will resume. ""That's gonna be necessary,"" he said, though he added public safety threats and national security threats are the first priorities.

Prinkey says the impact of a mass deportation program would be dramatic. ""One of the natural problems with undocumented workers, we don't know how many are here because they are undocumented. It isn't straightforward. I would wager that half or more of on-site labor is undocumented in specific geographic regions,"" he said.

""If you are building a nuclear facility or colleges and universities, you might be working with very few undocumented workers because there is a much higher level of oversight,"" Prinkey said. ""Those are sectors that will shrug and go forward."" He expected the same for union workers.

But there will be big impacts on single-family and multi-family housing construction, according to Prinkey, sectors of the housing market which he thinks could be ""paralyzed.""

""There will be incredible delays; the average 18-month project could take five years to complete because there are so few bodies,"" Prinkey said. ""It will be less devastating in Boston than Austin; in Austin, it would shut down every project,"" he added.

Despite the dire forecast, Prinkey doesn't think mass deportation will come to pass. ""Donald Trump is a developer; he understands what is going on. A mass deportation is not possible without crippling economic impact,"" he said.

"Trump's closing campaign message is hampered by distractions, disconnect","Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump attends his campaign rally at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan, U.S., November 1, 2024. Brian Snyder | Reuters

Former President Donald Trump's final week in the race against Vice President Kamala Harris has been hampered by a series of controversial remarks and unforced errors that threaten to mute his closing argument to voters amid a deluge of Democratic attacks and legal backlash. Throughout the week, Trump's campaign aired thousands of ads focused on his policy platform: universal tariffs, deeper tax cuts and sweeping immigrant deportations. But what garnered the most attention were a comedian's insults of Puerto Rico, Trump's violent rhetoric about a political opponent and a comment about women. Last Sunday, the Republican presidential nominee kicked off his final week on the campaign trail with a buzzy rally at New York's Madison Square Garden. The event was billed as an economic pitch to New Yorkers, but that message was drowned out by a circus of crude and at times, flat-out racist, remarks from some of the introductory speakers. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's opening set drew the loudest backlash after he called Puerto Rico ""a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean.""

Hinchcliffe's comments triggered a wave of criticism from Puerto Rican celebrities like musician Bad Bunny, as well as from elected officials and voters. ""It's not hitting well, I think people are pretty irritated,"" Allentown, Pennsylvania, Mayor Matt Tuerk told NBC News on Tuesday. ""Enraged is a word that I've heard a few people say."" Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state with 19 electoral votes, has a significant Puerto Rican population, heightening the political damage of Hinchcliffe's offensive comments. Trump campaign officials spent the following hours and days of the MSG rally doing cleanup and trying to distance their candidate from the controversy. ""This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,"" Trump campaign senior advisor Danielle Alvarez said last Sunday night.

Democrats and the Harris campaign seized on the controversy. ""We saw what happened in New York City at Madison Square Garden as another attempt to divide us,"" Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, said at a local campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Thursday. ""The disrespect given to our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico was not just unnecessary, it was incredibly hurtful."" Trump's closing message was also eclipsed by his verbal attacks on former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the Republican officials who has become a key campaign surrogate for Harris. ""She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her,"" Trump said Thursday at an Arizona event with conservative media personality Tucker Carlson. ""OK, let's see how she feels about it. You know when the guns are trained on her face.""

On Friday, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced that she was investigating whether Trump's violent remarks qualified as a death threat and a violation of state law. The Harris campaign has spun Trump's comment into a contrast to back its bipartisan case for the Democratic presidential nominee. ""You have Donald Trump who is talking about sending a prominent Republican to the firing squad and you have Vice President Harris talking about sending one to her Cabinet,"" Harris campaign senior advisor Ian Sams said Friday on MSNBC.

Trump's offhanded remark about Cheney again forced him and his campaign to spend the remaining days of the presidential race on damage control. ""All I'm saying is she was a nutty war hawk,"" Trump said Saturday on Fox News Channel's ""Fox & Friends."" He added, ""I said, 'Put a gun in her hand and let her go out and let her face the enemy with a gun in her hand.'"" Trump has branded his rambling rhetorical style, which typically derails his central policy message, as ""the weave."" ""See, I weave,"" he said during a Saturday rally in Virginia. ""Nobody else can do the weave like Trump.""

"Harris, Liz Cheney tour battleground states to reach Republicans down on Trump","Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris (L) holds a moderated conversation with Former US Rep. Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, at People's Light performing arts theater Malvern, Pennsylvania, on October 21, 2024.

Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney participated in a series of moderated conversations on Monday across the ""Blue Wall"" battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

""It's not about party, it's about right and wrong,"" Cheney said in Birmingham, Michigan. ""I would just remind people, if you are at all concerned, you can vote your conscience and not ever have to say a word to anybody. And there will be millions of Republicans who do that on Nov. 5.""

""Every single thing in my experience and in my background has played a part in my decision to endorse Vice President Harris, and that begins with the fact that I'm a conservative,"" Cheney said Monday morning in Malvern, Pennsylvania.

""I know that the most conservative of all conservative principles is being faithful to the Constitution. And you have to choose in this race, between someone who has been faithful to the Constitution, who will be faithful, and Donald Trump.""

Cheney, who called herself ""pro-life,"" said that nonetheless, draconian restrictions on women's access to reproductive healthcare, currently in force in several states, are ""not sustainable for us as a country, and it has to change.""



Since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade's abortion protections, conservative legislators have passed highly restrictive laws in more than two dozen states that limit women's legal rights to end a pregnancy.

The Harris campaign is courting disaffected Republicans, who may be on the fence about voting for Trump. The campaign kicked off a ""Republicans for Harris"" group in August and has since amplified the voices of a small, but growing, number of prominent Republicans who have come out in support of the Democratic vice president.

Harris on Monday reiterated her commitment to have a Republican in her cabinet if she becomes President, and said she knows it's in the nation's ""best interest"" to invite ""good ideas from wherever they come.""

""We need a healthy two-party system, we need to be able to have these good, intense debates about issues that are grounded in fact,"" Harris said in Malvern, PA as the room broke out in applause.

Cheney is becoming a key asset to Harris in the 11th hour sprint to Election Day, helping to create what political strategists call a ""permission structure"" for Republicans who might be reluctant to cross party lines to vote for Harris.

According to Cheney, patriotic Republicans have ""a duty and obligation to do what we know is right for the country.""",Oct 21 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/harris-cheney-bash-trump-vie-for-republican-crossover-votes.html
Op-ed: What to expect from Trump's first 100 days when it comes to China," U.S. President Donald Trump meets China's President Xi Jinping at the start of their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 29, 2019. Kevin Lemarque | Reuters

With Donald Trump's return to the White House, the U.S.-China relationship is heading straight into turbulent waters. Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a note of congratulations to Trump on Thursday, emphasizing cooperation over confrontation, shortly after China's Foreign Ministry offered a cautious response to Trump's victory, with spokeswoman Mao Ning emphasizing ""mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation."" These statements hint that, for now, Beijing is holding out hope for maintaining some dialogue and stability. Yet beneath this diplomatic language, there's a strong undercurrent of apprehension in Beijing, as Trump's mercurial style and ""shoot-from-the-hip"" approach could upend the delicate balance carefully nurtured by his predecessor. Trump's first 100 days are likely to be a rollercoaster, especially given his affinity for headline-grabbing moves. Experts predict a shift away from the structured, methodical diplomacy seen in the latter stages of the Biden administration. Under Biden, the Treasury and Commerce departments managed economic discussions with China through working groups, focused on macroeconomic stability and regulatory cooperation. These structured channels helped ensure open dialogue on issues like tariffs, technology restrictions, and financial stability. However, Trump's past preference for personal diplomacy over institutionalized mechanisms signals that we may soon witness a dismantling of these channels. This could leave the relationship dangerously prone to misunderstandings and overreactions, making early-phase instability almost a certainty. A potential role for Elon Musk as a geopolitical go-between China might look to alternative channels to manage relations with Trump's administration. One potential intermediary is Elon Musk, whose deep investments in China, particularly with Tesla, make him a natural link. Musk is not just any businessman; he's a high-profile figure in the tech and space sectors, and he has significant influence over emerging technologies that are critical to both U.S. and Chinese national interests. Beijing might view him as a ""mercurial messenger"" who could help grease the wheels, but they're aware of the risk.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images

The use of intermediaries in U.S.-China relations has precedent, but it hasn't always paid off. During Trump's first term, China experimented with influential American intermediaries like casino mogul Steve Wynn. These informal channels ended up being more trouble than they were worth, exposing intermediaries to political scrutiny without yielding much diplomatic progress. Musk's visibility and reputation mean that if he becomes entangled in diplomacy, he could face backlash from both Washington and Beijing. His high-profile involvement in sensitive industries, including autonomous vehicles and satellite technology, raises red flags in Washington's security community, especially concerning Starlink's influence in Taiwan. Musk could find himself under fire from U.S. officials if he appears to cater to Beijing's interests in these areas. Trade wars and tariffs: What we've seen and what's coming Trump has already hinted at his desire to ramp up tariffs on Chinese goods, with some aides suggesting an across-the-board 10% import tax and possible increases of up to 60% on Chinese imports. These numbers spell a stark departure from Biden's more targeted tariffs aimed at key sectors. The short-term economic impacts could be jarring. Expect companies to flood ports, racing to import goods before tariffs take effect, which could skyrocket shipping and warehousing costs. As these costs trickle down, American households, particularly lower-income ones, could see prices jump on everyday goods. Beyond immediate price increases, the strain on supply chains is a serious concern. U.S. ports and customs systems, already running on tight budgets and stretched resources, would be overwhelmed, leading to backlogs and supply disruptions. The knock-on effects would ripple through industries dependent on global supply chains — from electronics to automotive manufacturing — and could send shockwaves through the U.S. economy.

watch now

Trump's proposed tariffs could do more than just disrupt the American economy; they could incite global retaliation. Beijing would undoubtedly hit back with tariffs of its own, but the fallout wouldn't stop there. Key allies like the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, already wary of the Trump administration's economic policies, could also respond with tariffs on American goods. This move could kick off a broader trade war that isolates the U.S., disrupts alliances, and damages America's economic influence. Moreover, retaliatory tariffs would hurt American businesses, particularly those dependent on foreign markets. Job losses and economic slowdowns in export-heavy sectors would be likely, as American products face barriers in foreign markets. The cost of Trump's aggressive tariff strategy could be felt across the U.S. economy, with long-lasting consequences for American workers. National security and AI, autonomous vehicles National security considerations will also be front and center in Trump's early China policy, especially regarding technology restrictions. The Biden administration already laid the groundwork with extensive export controls on advanced technologies critical to AI and semiconductors. Trump is expected to retain these restrictions and may even expand them to further restrict China's access to cutting-edge technology. One particularly thorny issue is the role of autonomous and connected vehicle technology. With recent national security regulations tightening, Trump will need to decide whether he wants to maintain or escalate restrictions on Chinese access to these technologies. The security establishment in Washington will push for tighter controls, particularly in light of rising tensions over Taiwan and concerns about Chinese espionage. Trump's approach to outbound investment screening will also be critical. New rules to curb U.S. capital and expertise from bolstering Chinese tech are set to take effect, adding a new layer of complexity to the relationship. Trump could choose to keep these rules intact, expand them, or scale them back. Most observers expect him to lean toward decoupling, despite pressure from business interests, including those of Musk, to ease restrictions. Trump's return to the White House could catapult U.S.-China relations into uncharted waters. His leadership style — often impulsive and reactionary — suggests we're in for a rocky start. Systemic chaos, erratic social media posts, and abrupt policy shifts will likely dominate the early days, creating a climate of uncertainty for allies, businesses, and markets. While Trump's shoot-from-the-hip approach may resonate with his base, it also risks intensifying economic friction, frustrating alliances, and destabilizing an already fragile global economic landscape. If Trump follows through on hard line China policies, we could see an era of heightened confrontation and diminished multilateral cooperation, with the U.S.-China relationship poised for a dramatic — and potentially explosive — transformation. Whether the administration can navigate these challenges without triggering a full-blown economic crisis remains to be seen. Expect tariffs, technology restrictions, and Trump's unique brand of diplomacy to push the relationship to its limits.",Nov 7 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/op-ed-what-to-expect-from-trumps-first-100-days-on-china.html

Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General Motors

DETROIT – President-elect Donald Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to send the U.S. electric vehicle industry into a period of uncertainty. Republicans, led by the former president, have largely condemned EVs, claiming they are being forced upon consumers. Trump has vowed to roll back or eliminate many vehicle emissions standards under the Environmental Protection Agency as well as incentives to promote production and adoption of the vehicles such as the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Auto industry insiders and other officials have said it would be difficult for Trump to completely gut the IRA, but he could defund or limit EV subsidies through executive orders or other policy actions. Several people said they would expect Trump to target federal consumer credits that currently offer up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV rather than target industrial production credits for companies. ""The IRA will probably have some adjustments … I don't think the IRA will go away,"" David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-chairman of The Carlyle Group investment firm, told CNBC on Wednesday. ""It has some really good things in it that I think Republicans and Democrats will like.""

Many of the investments into EV production under the IRA having been taking place in Republican states such as Ohio, South Carolina and Georgia. Automotive executives are also quick to say they don't base investment decisions on who holds the White House, but there are natural adjustments with new administrations. ""Anytime there's an administration change, it's an interesting time for the industry because we have to go through new policies and regulations and have to bring new people up to speed on who we are and what we do,"" David Christ, group vice president and general manager of the Toyota Division in North America, said Wednesday during an Automotive Press Association event near Detroit. ""Administrations sometimes change every four years, so we don't really do a lot of modifying the strategy.""

Winners and losers?

Several Wall Street analysts have speculated legacy automakers — specifically the ""Detroit"" companies General Motors , Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis — would be the biggest winners of a second Trump term and Republican control of Congress. ""We see F and GM as the main beneficiaries from the Trump administration,"" BofA Securities analyst John Murphy said in a Wednesday investor note. ""The current environmental regime would pressure the core business of legacy [automakers, trucks,] to decarbonize by the end of the decade while shifting quickly to an EV portfolio."" GM's aspirations for an ""all-electric future"" and profitable EV business in the near term are highly reliant on federal tax credits. Analysts had indicated EV startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group would benefit more with a Democratic win. Toyota could also be a winner if EV regulations are reduced or eliminated, as the Japanese automaker has been slow to invest in all-electric models compared to hybrid vehicles. Shares of GM and Ford closed Wednesday up 2.5% and 5.6%, respectively. Stock prices for Toyota and Stellantis, which is experiencing significant problems in the U.S., were essentially level. Lucid and Rivian were each down, 5.3% and 8.3%, respectively.

An outlier is U.S. electric vehicle leader Tesla . CEO Elon Musk heavily campaigned in swing states for Trump, who has discussed making the billionaire a government efficiency czar. Shares of Tesla soared Wednesday by 15% and earlier notched a new 52-week high. ""We see RIVN and LCID challenged, which is largely reflected in the stocks,"" Murphy said. ""We don't expect meaningful issues for TSLA since it has already reached profitability and will introduce more entry level products that could be attractive for the larger public."" Several automakers did not immediately return request for comment after NBC News and several other media outlets called the election for Trump. Others such as the Detroit automakers and Hyundai Motor congratulated Trump and the newly elected officials across all levels of government. ""We look forward to working with the new Administration and Congress on policies that strengthen the U.S. automotive industry, which supports 9.7 million American jobs and drives more than $1 trillion into the economy each year,"" Ford said. ""We congratulate and look forward to working with the President-elect, Congress, and all elected officials to ensure that the U.S. continues to lead the world in technology and innovation, to the benefit of American workers and consumers alike,"" GM said.",Nov 6 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-reelection-what-it-means-for-evs.html 
Global ETFs slide as investors see Trump tariff policies hurting trade,"A balcony above a trading floor inside the Euronext NV stock exchange in Paris on March 13, 2023.

Several U.S.-listed funds tracking global stocks pulled back in Wednesday's session as investors considered Donald Trump's victory harmful to international equities.

Closely followed exchange-traded funds from iShares tracking South Korea , Hong Kong , Taiwan and Chile all slid on Wednesday. That comes despite major U.S. indexes soaring to record highs.

Those idiosyncratic pullbacks come as traders ready for President-elect Trump's proposed policies for taxing imports. He has floated a tariff of up to 20% on all goods coming into the U.S., with an especially high 60% levy on those coming from China specifically.

This policy was unpopular among voters, according to NBC News polling. But it appeared inconsequential in the race, despite the economy more broadly being a main issue for Americans heading to the polls.

""While the investing landscape remains favorable in the U.S., international markets are very exposed to tariff policy, "" said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management. ""That uncertainty could limit near-term upside in global stocks.""

These moves reflect the divergence between U.S. and international markets as investors around the globe take in America's election results.

While the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its best day in around two years, European markets largely struggled on Wednesday as it become clear that Trump would prevail. In the U.S. market, the iShares Core MSCI Europe ETF (IEUR) slid more than 2%.

Asia-Pacific markets were more mixed, with Japan's Nikkei 225 bucking the downtrend. Still, the U.S.-listed iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) shed more than 2% on Wednesday.

However, the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT) climbed around 3% and touched a new 52-week high, a rare bright spot among international-focused funds. The South American country last year elected libertarian Javier Milei, who was compared widely to Trump, as president.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks to the U.S. greenback against a basket of international currencies, reached its highest level since July. LPL Financial chief technical strategist Adam Turnquist noted that the dollar's rally comes as inflation expectations rose following Trump's victory.

Turnquist said continued strength in the American currency can hurt international stocks, particularly emerging markets. These markets have underperformed U.S. counterparts in recent years. Indeed, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) slid more than 1% on Wednesday.

U.S. dollar jumps as Donald Trump recaptures the White House,"The U.S. dollar strengthened against other major global currencies Wednesday as former president Donald Trump recaptured the White House, becoming just the second president in history to return to win two nonconsecutive White House terms.

The greenback strengthened by more than 1% against each of the Swiss franc and Chinese yuan, and nearly 2% against the Japanese yen . The ICE U.S. Dollar Index rose 1.66% and reached its highest level since July.

NBC News projects Trump's victory, making the 78-year-old the oldest person ever to win a U.S. presidential election. Traders generally expected that a strong election for Trump and Republicans in Congress could push the greenback higher. Trump's proposals to hike tariffs against major U.S. trading partners would, in theory, result in a stronger dollar.

""To the extent that he's able to get a lot of his stuff done — like deregulation, tax cuts, tariffs — you could see [the dollar index] easily above 110, maybe even up to 115,"" said Brad Bechtel, global head of foreign exchange at Jefferies.

The euro fell to 1.0731 against the dollar, hitting its lowest level since late June during the session. The dollar also hit its highest level against the Mexican peso since 2022 in overnight trading, but retreated from that mark as Wednesday progressed. Bechtel said the reversal in the peso trade could be due to short-term profit taking after the initial move.

NBC News projects that Trump has won key battleground states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Georgia, helping him reach the necessary 270 Electoral College votes to secure victory. NBC News also projects that the Republicans will retake the Senate.

Donald Trump's election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris marks a historic return to the White House — an extraordinary political comeback that is likely to have seismic ramifications for the global economy. Speaking to his supporters in Florida early Wednesday, Trump said an ""unprecedented and powerful mandate"" would usher in ""the golden age of America."" The former president's litany of campaign pledges include steep tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation and a push to withdraw from key global agreements. Analysts say it is hard to pin down the extent to which Trump will seek to implement these measures in his second four-year term, but the consequences of any will have clear repercussions across the globe. Lizzy Galbraith, political economist at asset manager Abrdn, said it remains to be seen exactly what style of presidency investors can expect when Trump returns to the White House. ""Congress has a really big part to play in this,"" Galbraith told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.

""If Trump does have unified control of Congress, as is looking very likely and is what we expect to happen over the next few weeks and days, then he does have greater latitude to implement his tax-cutting agenda, his deregulatory agenda, for example, but we are also likely to see elements of his trade policy sitting alongside that."" On tariffs, Galbraith said there were currently two schools of thought. Either Trump seeks to use them as a bargaining tool to gain concessions from other parties — or he delivers on his promise and implements them much more broadly.

Trump's favorite word

Trump has previously described ""tariff"" as his favorite word, calling it ""the most beautiful word in the dictionary."" In an effort to raise revenues, Trump has suggested he could impose a blanket 20% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., with a tariff of up to 60% for Chinese products and one as high as 2,000% on vehicles built in Mexico. For the European Union, meanwhile, Trump has said the 27-nation bloc will pay a ""big price"" for not buying enough American exports.

""Now, I think it is worth pointing out that we do think that in any situation which Trump is using tariffs quite often, his principal focus is going to be on China. And we don't see Trump's secondary tariff pledge — that baseline tariff, which would hurt European companies — as being all that feasible,"" Galbraith said. ""So, it's not necessarily our base case that you see something like a baseline tariff applied that would really hurt European goods although there is still a distinct possibility there that specific European products could be affected,"" she added. Analysts have warned that Trump's plan to impose universal tariffs are highly likely to raise prices for consumers and slow spending.

Europe

Ben May, director of global macro research at Oxford Economics, said the direct impact of Trump 2.0 on economic growth is likely to be limited in the near term, ""but masks major implications for trade and the composition of growth, and for financial markets."" For instance, May said that in a scenario in which the more radical aspects of Trump's policy agenda are adopted, particularly on tariffs, the impact across the globe will be ""very sizable."" ""A key unknown is whether a clean sweep raises the risk that a Trump administration will push through more extreme policy measures, such as larger, less-targeted tariffs,"" May said in a research note. ""Uncertainty over Trump's stance on the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East also adds to the risk of greater instability in both regions, which could take a toll on regional, and even global, growth,"" he added.

The prospect of a second Trump presidency had long been viewed as negative for Europe and the European Union more broadly. Yet, analysts at Signum Global Advisors said in a research note on Wednesday that ""the magnitude of that truth remains underappreciated."" Indeed, they argued that several factors mean the EU is likely to be ""the biggest loser of a second Trump era,"" citing trade tensions, an ongoing frustration with key European policy decisions and Trump's likely desire to double down on America's advantage at attracting capital relocation.

Asia

Analysts at Macquarie Group said Thursday that, at face value, Trump's election victory is ""bad news for Asia,"" particularly China, but the region is ""more prepared"" than in 2016, when he first moved into the White House.

""A key tenet of Trump's campaign was higher tariffs. While well telegraphed, the headwinds that are likely to sweep across Asia, particularly China, should spike volatility and compress multiples as uncertainty prevails,"" analyst at Macquarie Group said in a research note. ""A counter-balance to this is a likely acceleration in China stimulus measures,"" they added. ""The Chinese government has already outlined its ambitions to support economic growth at the 5% level and address property market woes to support domestic consumer confidence."" Mitchell Reiss, an American diplomat and distinguished fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, said there are likely to be some differences to the Trump playbook this time round.

Vice President Kamala Harris blasted Donald Trump on Wednesday for his reported praise of Adolf Hitler and said the Republican presidential nominee ""wants unchecked power."" Harris, the Democratic nominee, spoke at her residence in Washington, D.C., a day after reports of recent interviews with Trump's former White House chief of staff John Kelly, who recounted Trump's comments about the Nazi leader while Trump was president. Follow: Election 2024 live updates: Trump and Harris await Presidential election results ""It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans,"" Harris said. ""Yesterday, we learned that Donald Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired four-star general, confirmed that while Donald Trump was president, he said he wanted generals like Adolf Hitler,"" she said. ""Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal to the United States Constitution, he wants a military that is loyal to him.""

Harris' statement came less than two weeks before the Nov. 5 presidential election, which she noted in issuing a warning about Trump. Millions of Americans already have cast ballots in the contest in states that allow early voting. ""Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable,"" Harris said. ""And in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions. Those who once tried to stop him from pursuing his worst impulses would no longer be there and no longer be there to rein him in.""",Oct 23 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/harris-trump-hitler-election-john-kelly.html
Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally overshadowed by his allies’ crude and racist remarks,"Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a rally at Madison Square Garden, in New York, U.S., October 27, 2024. Andrew Kelly | Reuters

Former President Donald Trump delivered his standard lines on topics from immigration to the economy Sunday at a packed rally at Madison Square Garden, an event that was designed to be the start of his closing argument nine days out from Election Day at a venue off the battleground map that he has wanted to campaign at for years. But Trump's remarks in his hometown, New York City, which went for more than an hour, were overshadowed by comments made by warm-up speakers in the roughly five hours before his prime-time address. They included a comedian's racist jokes about Latinos and Black Americans and were condemned by multiple Republican members of Congress, as well as speakers who used increasingly inflammatory language to describe Vice President Kamala Harris. At the World's Most Famous Arena and before one of his largest rally crowds of the cycle, Trump railed against opponents he sees as ""the enemy from within,"" described the media as ""the enemy of the people,"" referred to Harris' ""low IQ"" and described her as a ""vessel"" for those aforementioned opponents, and said in a potential war with China the U.S. ""would kick their ass."" ""It's just this amorphous group of people, but they're smart and they're vicious, and we have to defeat them,"" Trump said in explaining his use of ""the enemy from within."" ""And when I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy. … They've done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we're fighting,"" he continued. It was the lesser-known speakers before Trump took the stage, however, who made big waves outside the arena.

David Rem, who announced his candidacy for mayor of New York on stage, echoed a rallygoer who called Harris ""the devil"" and added that she is ""the Antichrist."" Conservative media personality Tucker Carlson joked that Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, would be ""the first Samoan Malaysian low IQ, former California prosecutor ever to be elected president."" But no comments generated more attention than an opening routine from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who spoke early in the afternoon. His jokes included saying Latinos ""love making babies"" because ""there's no pulling out. They don't do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country."" Then he targeted Puerto Rico, describing it as ""a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now."" Then he told a joke about how he and a Black friend ""carved watermelons"" together. There was an uncomfortable reception to his punch lines in the arena. Within hours of his remarks, multiple pro-Trump GOP members of Congress condemned him.

Rep. María Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., said she was ""disgusted"" by his ""racist comment calling Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage,'"" adding the ""rhetoric does not reflect GOP values."" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said the joke ""bombed for a reason,"" was ""not funny"" and ""not true."" And Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., said Hinchcliffe's comments were ""completely classless & in poor taste."" ""I'm proud to be Puerto Rican,"" Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., who is locked in a competitive House race, posted on X. ""My mom was born and raised in Puerto Rico. It's a beautiful island with a rich culture and an integral part of the USA. The only thing that's 'garbage' was a bad comedy set. Stay on message."" The Trump campaign sought to distance itself from Hinchcliffe's routine. In a statement, senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said: ""This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign."" The Trump campaign had hyped up the event as what amounted to Trump's final pitch to voters in the closing days of the election. And he did offer some new policy positions from the stage, among them that he would ""support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or loved one,"" which comes as Harris has heavily promoted her proposal to expand Medicare to allow it to cover long-term in-home care. Homing in on his core immigration pitch, Trump also said he wants ""any migrant who kills someone in the U.S."" to face the death penalty."" And he offered insight into his thinking about how Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former independent presidential candidate who is backing Trump's bid, would fit into a future administration.

Kennedy would ""go wild on health,"" Trump said. ""I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines."" Trump visited the Manhattan arena amid a stretch that has also seen him campaign in California and Colorado, two additional states that aren't among the front-line presidential battlegrounds and are virtually assured of going for Harris this fall. Trump has also planned a rally for Virginia on one of the final days of the campaign, visiting another state where Harris is the odds-on favorite to win. His campaign has said such events are ""high-impact settings"" where his remarks will break through in the key battlegrounds. But Trump and his supporters made it clear from the stage they actually think they can win New York. ""I had a friend of mine, smart guy, he's a billionaire, texted me this morning and he said, 'Why the hell are you guys wasting your time in New York City instead of going to a swing state?'"" businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who sought the GOP nomination this year, said in his remarks. ""You wonder what I told him? I said: 'Welcome to 2024. New York is a swing state.'"" Joe Biden won New York by 23 points in 2020. It hasn't voted Republican at the presidential level since it went for Ronald Reagan 40 years ago. But Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul won by a significantly narrower margin in 2022 than Biden did two years before. In his speech, Trump, who spent most of his life as a prominent New York real estate magnate, said a victory in the state ""would be such an honor,"" noting a Republican hasn't won in decades. ""They all say, 'Sir, you're wasting your money,'"" he said. ""I don't think so.""

Democrats for weeks have compared the Madison Square Garden event to a pro-Nazi rally that took place at a previous iteration of the famed arena in 1939. Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly said recently that Trump fits the definition of a fascist and spoke positively about Adolf Hitler. Trump denied having spoken positively of Hitler, but Harris has promoted Kelly's account, and she has called the account ""deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous."" ""I don't see no stinkin' Nazis in here,"" wrestling star Hulk Hogan said in his speech. ""I don't see no stinkin' domestic terrorists in here. The only thing I see in here are a bunch of hard-working men and women that are real Americans, brother.""

Wall Street dealmakers and corporate leaders expect the flood gates to open on merger and acquisition activity after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. And he'll likely have congressional help. Trump defeated Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, and Republicans claimed a majority of the Senate in elections this week. That red wave is expected to spell loosening regulations on deal-making, with plenty of pent-up demand. ""We know kind of where the world is headed in a Trump environment because we've seen it before,"" said Jeffrey Solomon, president of TD Cowen, on CNBC's ""Money Movers"" Wednesday. ""I think the regulatory environment will be much more conducive to economic growth. There will be lighter and targeted regulation."" Solomon added that the scaled-back regulation will be focused on certain areas ""of particular interest to the Trump administration,"" rather than a broad based reassessment of the entire landscape. In recent years, there has been greater scrutiny of pending deals by the Biden administration's Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, headed by Chair Lina Khan. Some have pointed to that dynamic as a chilling factor on deal flow. High interest rates and soaring company valuations have contributed, too. Khan said in September that ""when you see greater scrutiny of mergers, you can see greater deterrence of illegal mergers."" Her hard line has drawn harsh criticism, but now, there's optimism around a forthcoming FTC with a lighter hand. ""Assuming interest rates drop and you see corporate tax rates go down, the ingredients are there for a really active M&A market,"" said one top dealmaker, who talked to CNBC on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. On Wednesday, markets rallied on the Republican presidential win, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 1,500 points to a new record high.

Sector specific

Some sectors, including financial and pharmaceutical industries in particular, are likely to get a lift under a second Trump regime, experts said. Pharmaceutical executives are especially optimistic that lighter antitrust enforcement could clear the way for deal-making, said one health-care-focused M&A advisor, who added that antitrust enforcement could have ""hardly gotten worse"" under either administration but now believes things will improve ""meaningfully."" Khan has taken on scores of biopharma mergers over the last four years, arguing that monopolies will stifle the development of new drugs in certain disease areas and hurt consumer choice. Biotech company Illumina last year said it would divest diagnostic test maker Grail after heated battles with the FTC and European antitrust regulators. Also last year, the FTC blocked Sanofi's proposed acquisition of a drug in development for Pompe disease, a genetic condition, from Maze Therapeutics. Sanofi ultimately terminated that deal. ""Whether or not Lina Khan is bounced day one is a key consideration, but even if fewer changes at the FTC take place, there is no doubt this administration — at least on paper — will be far more amicable when it comes to business combinations,"" Jared Holz, Mizuho health-care equity strategist, said in an email on Wednesday. One top dealmaker expected an M&A uptick broadly, but agreed that pharmaceuticals and the financial sector were particularly poised for a resurgence. That deal-maker also noted that with the Senate flipping, more outspoken antitrust voices like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., could find it more difficult to push for DOJ or FTC investigations. In the financial sector regional banks recognize the need for scale, making them likely candidates for consolidation, said one former industry executive, noting that smaller banks had been getting gobbled up for ""some time."" That person expects the pace and size of those acquisitions to ramp up under a Trump presidency. Other industries, such as tech, may still face an uphill battle in getting deals done. One M&A advisor, who also spoke to CNBC anonymously, noted that Trump's disdain for Big Tech companies — historically active deal-makers — might keep them on the sidelines. On Wednesday, tech leaders took to social media to congratulate Trump. Apparent GOP opposition to the CHIPS Act means that semiconductor consolidation might be challenging, the advisor noted, while cautioning it is still too early to know what a Trump presidency would mean. CNBC previously reported that Qualcomm recently approached Intel about a potential takeover. ""I think the simplest way to put it is more deals, less regulation with the administration having its thumb on the scale, perhaps with a willingness to pick winners and losers,"" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Integrated Media, which specializes in digital media investments.

Eyes on retail, media

A Trump presidency could usher in a number of retail deals that have been hamstrung by the FTC. Kroger's bid to take over grocery chain Albertsons could have a better chance of getting approved under Trump, as could Tapestry's proposed acquisition of Capri . The merger between Kroger and Albertsons is currently under review by a federal judge, while Tapestry is working to appeal a federal order that granted the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction against the tie-up. ""The hostile approach of the FTC to mergers and acquisitions will almost certainly be reset and replaced with a worldview that is more favorable to corporate dealmaking,"" said GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders. ""This does not necessarily mean that big deals like Kroger-Albertsons will be waved through, but it does mean others like Tapestry-Capri will receive a far warmer reception than they have under the Biden administration."" Meanwhile, ongoing turmoil in the media industry has led many to consider consolidation as the next step for the sector. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav on Thursday highlighted opportunities that could come up if regulations were to loosen, doubling down on comments he made earlier this year at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference. ""We have an upcoming new administration. … It's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different, that would provide a real positive and accelerated impact on this industry that's needed,"" Zaslav said on an earnings call. Broadcast station group owner Sinclair on Wednesday echoed a similar sentiment. ""We're very excited about the upcoming regulatory environment,"" CEO Chris Ripley said during an earnings call. ""It does feel like a cloud over the industry is lifting here."" Still, the track record between the previous Trump administration and the Biden administration for media industry deals is split. Trump's DOJ allowed Disney to buy Fox's assets, but then sued to block AT&T's deal for Time Warner. Under the Biden administration, Amazon's $8.5 billion deal for MGM and the merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery Communications were both waved through, but a federal judge blocked the $2.2 billion sale of Simon & Schuster to Penguin Random House. Skydance Media and Paramount Global agreed to merge earlier this year and expect to receive regulatory approval in 2025.",Nov 7 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/wall-street-expects-trump-presidency-will-unlock-deal-making.html
"Here's what the Trump presidency could mean for the housing market, experts say","1. Deregulation to increase affordability

At the end of Trump's first presidency, he signed an executive order creating ""Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing: Federal, State, Local and Tribal Opportunities."" ""That could be a blueprint going forward,"" said Dennis Shea, executive director of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Terwilliger Center. During his 2024 campaign, Trump called for slashing regulations and permit requirements, which can add on to housing costs for homebuyers. Experts say that regulatory costs trickle down to the prices homebuyers face. ""We will eliminate regulations that drive up housing costs with the goal of cutting the cost of a new home in half,"" Trump said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Sept. 5. About 24% of the cost of a single-family home and about 41% of the cost of a multifamily home are directly attributable to regulatory costs at the local, state and federal level, Tobin said. ""If we reduce the regulatory burden on home construction or apartment construction, we're going to lower costs [for] the consumer,"" Tobin said.

2. Impacts on construction workforce

Trump has also blamed rising home prices on a surge of illegal immigration during the Biden administration. However, experts say that most undocumented immigrants are not homeowners. Instead, they live in homes owned by U.S. citizens, Channel said. If a mass deportation were to happen, such homes would remain occupied, he added. Yet, proposals like mass deportations and tighter border control could impact housing affordability, Tobin said. About a third, or 31%, of construction tradesmen in the U.S. in 2022 were immigrants, according to NAHB, which analyzed 2022 Census data. ""Anything that threatens to disrupt the flow of immigrant labor will send shock waves to the labor market in home construction,"" Tobin said. It's been difficult to recruit native-born workers into the construction industry, experts say. According to a 2017 NAHB survey, construction trades are an unpopular career choice for young American adults. Only 3% showed interest in the field, the poll found.

watch now

Therefore, a mass sweeping of available workers can create a labor shortage in construction. And with fewer workers, wages might increase, which ""will likely be passed onto consumers"" through higher home prices, Channel said. What's more, it will take longer for construction companies to complete housing projects and therefore slow down efforts to increase supply, he added. While ""we are doing a better job"" training the domestic workforce through trade schools, apprenticeship programs and other initiatives, the industry still heavily relies on immigrant labor, Tobin said.

3. Tariffs could hike building costs

Trump has proposed a 10% to 20% tariff on all imports across the board, as well as a rate between 60% and 100% for goods from China. A blanket tariff at 10% to 20% on raw building materials like lumber could push housing costs higher, as well as materials for home renovations, experts say. ""Any tariffs that raise the cost of the products are going to flow directly to the consumer,"" Tobin said. On average, construction costs for single-family homes is around $392,241, according to a data analysis by ResiClub, a housing and real estate data newsletter. ""It depends on what the tariffs look like,"" said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. ""There could be varying impacts.""",Nov 11 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/11/what-trumps-presidency-could-mean-for-the-housing-market-in-the-us.html

"What to expect when President Trump tries to make tax cut promises reality, even with GOP sweep in Congress","Attendees wear ""No Tax On OT"" hardhats during the closing campaign event with former US President Donald Trump, not pictured, at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024.

Mnuchin noted that the original goal in 2017 was a 15% corporate income tax linked to businesses that support U.S.-based manufacturing and jobs, but Stamper said that would be ""massively expensive.""

The reflexive thinking that a traditional GOP caters to the interests of big business when it comes to tax policy isn't necessarily the case judging from campaign efforts. ""Look at which tax cuts were getting the most focus on the campaign trail. A lot were more populist individual tax cuts,"" Stamper said. ""Can they really have a corporate wish list leapfrog those? It's a tough sell. I would say it takes some tax increases companies were afraid of off the table, and in 2025, it gives the GOP the chance to rethink, not just blindly extend, the 2017 tax cuts in current form.""

""Conservatives don't have the stomach to do all of the 2017 cuts and keep campaign promises on the deficit,"" said Dustin Stamper, head of the tax legislative affairs practice at Grant Thornton. ""They are going to have to make some hard choices on priorities.""

But for U.S. corporations, ""I don't think people can necessarily assume, when all is said and done, there is not revenue pressure that will show up on the corporate ledger,"" he said.

Traditional GOP tax policy might be thought of as favoring more business tax cuts. But for corporations, the only certainty at this point, according to Rohit Kumar, co-leader of PwC's national tax office and a former deputy chief-of-staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is that the odds of a dramatic tax increase have been ""taken off the table.""

""The top priority is extending the Trump tax cuts and the signature part of his program. I think that should be easy to pass in Congress, particularly if the Republicans control the House as well,"" Mnuchin said .

Any GOP majority will still be a relatively narrow one, complicating the path of tax policy, government funding and the debt ceiling debate. But one development that should help Trump is expectations that lawmakers will be even more deferential to him than they were during his first time. Already, those vying for Senate leadership posts have entered into a competitive game to show Trump how far they will go for his wishes.

Kumar said to expect one of the first big discussions on Capitol Hill, assuming the GOP maintains control of the House of Representatives, to be about the extension of the 2017 tax cuts and how to finance them without increasing the deficit. ""There will be some who say it should all be deficit-financed, and that's more than $4 trillion.""

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending the Trump tax cuts for the next 10 years would add $4.6 trillion to the deficit.

$4.6 trillion deficit and debate over whether tax cuts pay

In traditional conservative economic circles, there is an argument often made that tax cuts are self-financing, at least partially if not wholly, as a result of the economic growth that results from the policy. And there are powerful figures on the Hill when it comes to tax policy who are seen as still hewing to this philosophy, such as Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo.

But Stamper says this view ""is starting to fray with conservatives on the House side,"" and adding as much as $4.6 trillion to the deficit will make this faction with the GOP uncomfortable with no offsetting revenue.

Notably, House Speaker Mike Johnson has voiced support for the traditional view of funding tax cuts through economic growth.

If the Trump administration can convince the House and Senate in a sweep scenario that a big deficit-financed tax bill is the right policy, that could create some flexibility for the broader suite of tax cuts proposed, but Kumar said the reality is that ""some in the GOP are starting from the position of having to pay for every penny. Getting these GOP lawmakers on board, he added, ""might be more heroic.""

""Talk to lawmakers on Capitol Hill and they are already justifiably concerned about having the political bandwidth to address expiring provisions, let alone pick up additional tax cuts to carry across the finish line,"" Kumar said.

It's also what PwC described as a ""must-pass year"" for the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act policies, with failure to act resulting in ""across-the-board tax increases on virtually every individual taxpayer and automatic increases in some business taxes.""

Trump may be the ""most pro-stock market president in history,"" but for businesses, Kumar added, ""I start from the position that additional tax decreases will be very difficult to obtain, given there are several trillion in individual taxes expiring.""

Individual tax cuts versus Social Security, business tax breaks

History shows that when it comes to the battle between individual and business tax cuts, contrary to popular perception, individual tax issues are always politically dominant issue.

In recent years, Hill battles over a research & development tax credit for corporations died on multiple occasions due to GOP concerns about the Child Tax Credit that was on the other side of the bargain. ""Changes on the individual side dominate even when there is buzz about tax relief on both sides of the ledger,"" Kumar said.

Corporations would like to see action on a host of issues, from corporate income tax rates to the excise tax on stock buybacks enacted during the Biden administration, bonus depreciation, the R&D tax credits, and small business tax policy.

Any new individual tax cut promises made by Trump will face similar hurdles. ""Adding new individual tax relief suffers from the same obstacle: get in line behind the cost of all the expiring provisions,"" he said.

Hedge fund manager and Trump ally John Paulson, who had been rumored as a potential Treasury Secretary candidate before bowing out of consideration, told the New York Times in an interview ahead of Election Day that there is a way to pay for new tax cuts by lowering their total cost through narrowing eligibility requirements.

""You need to keep the concept of what he wants to achieve, and put guardrails around it so you achieve the goals, but lower the revenue impact,"" Paulson said.

In a revenue-constrained environment, this ""little of everything"" approach could be pitted against the ""a lot of a few things"" approach, what Kumar described as ""the art of the doable.""

The Trump administration and GOP members on the Hill are expected to move relatively quickly, and use the reconciliation process in a bid to enact tax policy with only Republican votes, as was the case in 2017 when the TCJA was enacted. That simple majority process is the best path for the expiring 2017 tax cuts, but would be a more difficult road for other provisions discussed on the campaign trail, such as Social Security tax cuts, with reconciliation rules stipulating no changes to Social Security.

But that may be one of the bargains that the GOP has to make. When it comes to the effectiveness of reconciliation to address the 2025 expirations, Republicans may not ""let any particular provision force them off that tool,"" Kumar said. ""The political penalty would be in excess of upside from something you can't do in reconciliation.""

""Social Security will be the hardest to achieve,"" Stamper said. ""There may be other ways to write rules but there are hard limits to what can be done through reconciliation. ... But we know they won't get near the 60 votes needed to do whatever they want, and the only viable option is reconciliation,"" he said.

Even using this approach, PwC cautions that challenges in reaching an agreement could delay action on a tax bill until late 2025.

Trump tariffs and government revenue

The Trump administration does have new arguments to make about how its policies will limit the deficit impact of new tax cuts, predominantly, in the form of aggressive trade tariffs. By some estimates, tariffs as outlined by President-Elect Trump could add $2 trillion to $3.3 trillion in revenue, but that is a figure estimated in isolation from the parallel finding that tariffs would serve as an additional tax on households running into the thousands of dollars annually. Even the trillions generated from tariffs would ""fall well short of what is needed to fully offset the revenue losses of making the expiring provisions of the 2017 tax cuts permanent,"" according to the Tax Foundation.

Kumar said the tariffs are not insignificant math in the coming tax battle, representing as much as two-thirds of the cost, but it would require some flexibility on the Hill when it comes to how tax law is scored. Tariffs revenue would not be officially scored as part of any tax legislation, requiring House and Senate Republicans to be willing to consider revenue from sources not in the bill or CBO estimates. The GOP would need to be willing to see sufficient political cover in that approach, and there is a recent precedent — offered by the Democrats.

When passing the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, it was $80 billion in additional IRS funding that got West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin on board, with the CBO writing a memo saying that if spent correctly, the funding would allow the IRS to ultimately raise $200 billion in revenue — a net gain of $120 billion. ""Manchin pointed to it and said, 'This is why I am comfortable voting.' We would be asking the GOP to do something similar,"" Kumar said.

There is also the opportunity to repeal aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, another complicated effort given the placement of many benefits in red states and districts, and also not a tax promise that was discussed at the same level or volume during the campaign.

""If you believe in the concept of political capital, that accrues through things you were talking about actively on the campaign trail and you feel more pressure to fill the promises made the loudest,"" Stamper said. As a result, it would make sense for the GOP to ""pick a few,"" and pick measures that ""seem most practical and achievable.""

Stamper thinks there will be pressure to pursue the no tax on tipped income measure since it was among the first promises made on the campaign trail and various versions of it have support from both political parties. (Kamala Harris supported the policy as well.)

Removing the limit on SALT deductions put in place in Trump's 2017 tax act alone could add $1 trillion to the total cost of a new tax bill. ""There are some major tradeoffs there,"" Stamper said. ""Lots of GOP members in districts in high tax states that really hate the SALT cap, but the House and Senate majority could be narrow.""

National debt and the bond market

It will be some months before the Trump administration reveals its hand. Some data points may come in the form of a Treasury Secretary nominee appearing before a Hill finance committee. But the first detailed look at which campaign proposals are being pursued will come in a budget proposal that the new president sends to Capitol Hill, typically in the spring. That can often be delayed in the first year of a presidency, but in this case the timing could change based on whether Trump's term is considered a first or fifth year.

There are additional ideas under consideration in a second Trump term that can influence overall government spending, such as the government efficiency effort to potentially be headed by Elon Musk. However, even if that were to come to pass, appropriations bill reality on the hill is that every dollar spent is a dollar that every recipient in every district will put up a fight over. And the biggest spending items of all, mandatory spending across government health-care programs, Social Security, interest on debt and the Defense budget, each double-digit percentage items in the federal budget, will add to the uphill battle against the deficit. Trump has made clear he has no interest in taking on entitlements and a GOP sweep would potentially make that even more political unpalatable.

All of these mandatory spending items are growing relative to GDP at a worrisome rate, with interest on the national debt growing faster as a percentage of total spending than any other budget item, and expected to continue to rise. But neither of the two political parties typically wants to take the heat, and risk in the next election cycle, that can come from major entitlement program changes, with divided government thought by many to be the better bet for action. That implies that the deficit will continue to grow, and that is what the bond market has been signaling in recent months, and was signaling even before election results were clear. Bond yields have been rising even though the Federal Reserve as begun cutting interest rates and that has been attributed, at least in part, to growing concerns about the deficit from the market, and belief that these concerns are becoming persistent.

The current national debt total is nearly $36 trillion and there is the potential for close to $5 trillion added to the deficit over a decade in the cost of a renewed 2017 tax plan, without additional new tax policy measures. While there is now greater attention to the bond market and the potential macroeconomic effects of higher deficits, the reality in Washington, D.C., is that long-term economic concerns aren't usually the deciding factor.

""The arc of history here reminds us that every time long-term deficit concerns come into conflict with near-term policy, near-term wins,"" Kumar said. ""It's batting about 1.000."" And that may be the most encouraging political factor for passage of tax legislation with a price tag that could run as high as $5 trillion. ""You don't get that without that maxim being consistently true across both parties over 40 years,"" he said.",Nov 11 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/11/trump-tax-cut-promises-gop-deficit-hawks-congress-debt.html
Trump names campaign manager Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff,"Susie Wiles, senior advisor of Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump attend a campaign rally of Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump at PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S., November 4, 2024.

President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday named co-campaign chair Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, one of the most important nonelected posts in Washington.

She will be the first woman in that role.

Wiles, 67, a Florida native, is one of the most respected operatives in Republican politics. Along with helping helm Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, she was his state director in Florida during the previous two contests.

""Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,"" Trump said in a statement Thursday. ""Susie is tough, smart, innovative and is universally admired and respected.""

Trump called his 2020 campaign ""successful,"" even though he lost the race to Joe Biden. For years, he has continued to make baseless claims that that election was stolen.

Before she joined Trump's team, Wiles helped lead Rick Scott to victory as governor of Florida in 2010. He is now a U.S. senator. Wiles was also brought in to help save the 2018 campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won after initially having floundered.

After Trump's resounding victory Tuesday over Vice President Kamala Harris, there was an overwhelming sense that Wiles was the front-runner to be White House chief of staff.

""If she wants it, it's hers,"" a Trump adviser told NBC News on Thursday morning. ""Her standing with Trump and what she just pulled off [winning by a huge margin] makes it an easy choice if she wants it.""",Nov 7 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/trump-names-campaign-manager-susie-wiles-as-white-house-chief-of-staff.html 
CNBC's Inside India newsletter: How will the next Trump administration impact India?,"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi shakes hands with former U.S. President Donald Trump before a meeting at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on February 25, 2020.

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

Donald Trump decisively won the U.S. presidential election, becoming one of only two American leaders who have retaken the keys to the White House after a spell out of office.

Just as in 2016, investors are grappling with policy uncertainty surrounding his presidency and what might come in the following year.

Yet, the outcomes are likely to be vastly different from eight years ago — at least as far as India is concerned.

Manufacturing

At first glance, Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign appears double-edged and at odds with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" initiative.

Taxes on goods imported from China into the U.S. will likely benefit India, most analysts say, as companies shift manufacturing to the South Asian nation to avoid duties. Global trade changed considerably over the past four years — benefiting India — as President Joe Biden retained much of Trump's tariffs on China.

""Potential tariff or non-tariff barriers on Chinese imports in the U.S. and India's domestic manufacturing thrust with Make in India, could be positive for Indian [electronics manufacturing services] companies in areas like PCBs [electric circuits], semiconductors, mobile phones, cables and wires, among others,"" said Macquarie Capital's head of India research Aditya Suresh, citing cable and wire maker Polycab as an example of a stock that stands to benefit in this scenario.

Analysts also suggest that the benefits from supply chains reorienting, with companies basing themselves in India and out of China, will outweigh the impact of universal tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S.

However, Trump took unilateral measures during his previous reign, targeting India with tariffs by removing the country from a special trade program known as the Generalized System of Preferences. About $5 billion worth of exports from India to the U.S. have had duties applied to them since 2019, according to the Observer Research Foundation.

Tax rises and tax cuts

Import duties can raise U.S. consumer prices and push up inflation alongside bond yields . Higher U.S. Treasury yields often usurp money away from emerging markets rapidly, including India, in today's viscous market environment.

Why invest in high-risk equities overseas when Uncle Sam is offering 4.5% every year risk-free on your investment?

Foreign investors have already begun walking with their wallets, selling $1.5 billion worth of Indian stocks this month on top of the $11 billion in October. Last month, the Nifty 50 index fell by 6% and logged its worst monthly performance since March 2020.

Slashing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, if Republicans take control of both houses of Congress, will also boost U.S. stock markets. That makes it harder for Indian equities to outperform just as Mumbai-listed stocks start to struggle to meet earnings expectations.

Immigration

President-elect Trump campaigned on curbing illegal immigration in the United States, and just as long as the new administration's focus remains on ""illegal,"" the Indian IT sector remains shielded. However, if unemployment continues to rise, as it has over the past few quarters, policy uncertainty risk becomes front and center.

""IT services could see an impact with U.S. being the dominant end market as well as potential changes to immigration, if any,"" said Citi economists Samiran Chakraborty and Baqar Zaidi.

Companies such as Tata Consultancy Services , HCL Tech , and U.S.-listed Infosys are heavily reliant on work permits to bring employees from India into the U.S. However, over the years, the share of foreign workers employed at these companies has reportedly fallen to less than half, making them more resilient to changes in visa rules. Additionally, since the Covid-19 pandemic, most companies have trimmed their costs with remote working.

Energy

On the one hand, analysts expect Indian interests to be aligned with those of the United States regarding oil prices . Trump's previous term in office, whether intentionally or coincidently, saw moderate to low oil prices. Market observers expect that to be repeated in his second term.

As India imports over 90% of its oil needs, New Delhi will likely welcome any move by the U.S. to keep oil prices low.

A quick resolution of the war in Ukraine — Trump's campaign promise — would also prove to be negative for oil prices.

On the other hand, India is also hoping to become an exporter of renewable energy products and judging by the stock market's reaction to the news of the U.S. election results, that sector is unlikely to be in Trump's good books.

Mumbai-listed wind turbine maker Suzlon Energy 's shares tumbled after the U.S. election results. Although the company earns just 1.5% of its total revenue from the U.S., sales have grown by 42% over the past year, according to FactSet data. Will it continue to grow in the future?

Harris' closing argument: America needs a new generation of leaders after a decade of Trump-era 'fear and division',"US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks on The Ellipse just south of the White House in Washington, DC, on October 29, 2024.

Vice President Kamala Harris worked to balance two central messages in her closing argument to voters Tuesday evening: The first is that former President Donald Trump poses a real danger to the country if he is returned to office, and the second is that Harris represents a new chapter of American leadership.

""On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemy's list,"" Harris said to a crowd of roughly 60,000 supporters on and around the Ellipse lawn in Washington, framed by a view of the White House. ""When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.""

The Ellipse is also infamous as the site of Stop the Steal rally on January 6, 2021.There, Trump called on his most loyal supporters to ""fight,"" shortly before they violently attacked the Capitol.

And while Harris used that symbol to occasionally mention what she sees as Trump's threat to American democracy, she spent a large chunk of her speech summarizing her own policy platform.

Just a week out from Election Day, the speech was one of Harris' final efforts to win voters over on her candidacy and turn the election into a referendum on the Trump era of American politics, which she described as a decade of chaos.

""It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America,"" she said.

""I know that many of you are still getting to know who I am,"" Harris added, before listing various planks of her policy platform.

She highlighted specific proposals aimed at lowering the cost of living, strengthening the middle class and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.

""I recognize this has not been a typical campaign,"" the vice president said, nodding to the historic past several months, during which Trump was nearly assassinated and President Joe Biden abruptly ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris to lead the Democratic ticket.

Ahead of Tuesday's keynote address, Harris sat for five local news interviews Tuesday targeting voters across the battlegrounds in places like Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh.

Both Harris and Trump are vying to convince voters that they would be a departure from the status quo, as polls regularly find respondents dissatisfied with the direction of the country.

In turn, Harris has worked to paint herself as the non-incumbent candidate who represents a new generation of American leadership — though that is a delicate balance given her current role in the Biden administration.

""I have been honored to serve as Joe Biden's vice president,"" Harris said Tuesday night. ""But I will bring my own experiences and ideas to the Oval Office. My presidency will be different.""

Meanwhile, Trump has tried to remind voters of her position as second-in-command in the current administration, capitalizing on a general mood of discontent, especially on issues like the economy and the border.

Trump also delivered remarks Tuesday, which his campaign billed as his final message to voters.

In the three months since Harris took over Biden's well established campaign operation, she has significantly eroded Trump's polling advantage. She has also raised more than $1 billion, a jaw-dropping feat at this stage in the election cycle.

Harris has also capitalized on some key endorsements from superstars like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, along with Republicans who crossed the aisle to support her. Most visibly, former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney.

Despite the polling gains and her cash advantage, the presidential race remains a dead heat going into its final week, with polling consistently rating the candidates as tied within key battleground states and nationally.",Oct 29 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/harris-trump-closing-argument-speech-washington-2024-election.html

""He measured his success in his first term by how well the stock market did. You know, it seems to me very unlikely he's going to implement policies that are going to be bad for the stock market.""

The market already reached new heights in reaction to Trump's election win as investors bet that his promises of tax cuts and deregulation will propel growth and benefit risk assets.

Progressives gear up for their first big fight if Harris wins: Protecting Lina Khan,"FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan (L), and Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic Presidential Candidate. Reuters (L) | Getty Images (R)

Avoiding a confirmation fight

While the prospect of a Trump comeback has motivated progressives to rally around Harris in the near term, many still worry about the direction of the party, particularly as it welcomes more affluent and center-right voters who are turned off by the MAGA-infused GOP. Will Democrats continue to be a populist, worker-oriented party? Or will the electoral realignment cause them to start catering more to business? If Harris loses, Democrats will have bigger problems, of course. But if she wins, activists and party stakeholders will be looking at what she does with Khan as one clue about how she sees the future of the party. ""It'd be a strategic blunder for Harris to pick an ugly fight over Lina Khan's future when there's already strong consensus among Democrats. Moderate senators like Bob Casey and Jackie Rosen are actively campaigning on the FTC's work to lower prices,"" said a Senate Democratic aide, who was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. ""Progressives are ready to fight, but if Harris caves to her billionaire donors it will be her prosecutor brand and the entire Democratic Party that gets bruised in an unnecessary brawl."" Cuban's call for Khan's ouster led Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to issue a warning to the ""billionaires ... trying to play footsie"" with Harris: ""Anyone goes near Lina Khan and there will be an out and out brawl. And that is a promise,"" she said on X. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also threw in for Khan, calling her ""the best FTC chair in modern history."" The Harris campaign declined to comment for this story. Progressives have inertia on their side. Khan, whose term expired last month, can remain in the role until she is replaced. Removing her would not only infuriate the left but it could provoke a confirmation fight with Senate Republicans over her replacement. Some in the progressive movement believe Harris should simply leave her there without going through confirmation again in the Senate if need be. Khan has broad support among Democrats and even some Republicans, including moderates outside the progressive movement. ""Khan has a lot of allies in Congress,"" said Deiseroth. ""Keeping her is the path of least resistance that will make the most people on the left happy."" Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry and its allies also want to replace Gensler atop the SEC, since he has taken a skeptical view of the nascent industry. The main pro-Crypto super PAC Fairshake has spent more than $204 million on the 2024 elections, cultivating a slew of new allies in Congress and in Harris' orbit, including Cuban. Harris herself has said relatively little about her thoughts on cryptocurrency, which makes progressives worry that in the absence of strong views of her own, and little organized opposition from crypto skeptics, they could have a hard time being heard. Jeff Hauser, the founder of the progressive watchdog Revolving Door Project, said he's hoping Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, the current chair of the Senate Banking Committee, will win his tough re-election contest to serve as a countervailing voice inside the party. ""The more an issue touches on crypto, the less confident I am in her team,"" he said.

Trump tariff threat looms large on several Asian countries — not just China — says Goldman Sachs,"President Donald Trump meets business leaders at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, in November, 2017.

Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. elections has raised the specter of higher tariffs on China — but it may not be the only Asian country that faces this predicament, according to Goldman Sachs.

While the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China has decreased somewhat since the Trump administration, deficits with other Asian exporters have risen significantly and may come under increased scrutiny, Andrew Tilton, Goldman's chief Asia-Pacific economist, said in a recent note.

""With Trump and some likely appointees focused on reducing bilateral deficits, there is a risk that — in a sort of 'whack-a-mole' manner--burgeoning bilateral deficits could eventually prompt U.S. tariffs on other Asian economies,"" he said.

A tariff is a tax on imported goods, but it isn't paid by the exporting country. So U.S. tariffs will be paid by companies looking to import products into the country, raising their costs.

""Korea, Taiwan, and especially Vietnam have seen large trade gains versus the U.S.,"" Tilton observed, adding that Korea's and Taiwan's positions are reflective of their ""privileged positions"" in the semiconductor supply chain, while Vietnam has benefited from the redirection of trade from China.

In 2023, South Korea's trade surplus with the United States reportedly reached a record $44.4 billion, the largest surplus with any country, with car exports making up almost 30% of all shipments to the U.S.

Taiwan's exports to the United States in the first quarter of 2024 hit a record high of $24.6 billion, increasing 57.9% compared with the same period last year, with the largest export growth stemming from information technology and audiovisual products.

Meanwhile, Vietnam's trade surplus with the U.S between January and September stands at $90 billion.

India and Japan also run trade surpluses with the U.S., with Japan's surplus remaining relatively stable and India's increasing moderately in recent years, said Goldman Sachs.

Going forward, these Asian trading partners might try to lower these surpluses and ""deflect attention"" via various means, such as shifting imports toward the U.S. where possible, Tilton expects.

""Trade policy is where Mr Trump is likely to be most consequential for Emerging Asia in his second term as U.S. president,"" Barclays Bank analysts wrote in a note dated Friday.

Trump's proposed tariffs are most likely to inflict ""greater pain"" on more open economies in the region, with Taiwan more exposed to that threat than Korea or Singapore, the bank's economists led by Brian Tan wrote.

""We see Thailand and Malaysia in the middle, with Thailand estimated to take a slightly larger hit,"" the note added.

U.S. data shows that the U.S. trade deficit with China narrowed to $279.11 billion in 2023, from $346.83 billion in 2016.

Although U.S. trade with China dwindled following the implementation of tariffs in the first Trump administration, trade volumes were channeled to third countries instead such as Vietnam, Mexico, Indonesia and Taiwan instead, Mari Pangestu, former minister of trade in Indonesia, said last Thursday.

""But if you look at the supply chain, actually most of the components are still coming from China. We call it lengthening the supply chain. So in Trump 2.0, two things will happen. He will start noticing that [trade] is still going to China,"" she said during the FT Commodities Asia Summit held in Singapore following the announcement of Trump's victory.

""This is going to increase protection. Not just towards China, but to countries that have bilateral deficits with the U.S.,"" Pangestu said.

Regardless of tariffs, Goldman still expects continued pressure for the relocation of certain supply chains from China to Southeast Asia, India or Mexico in particular.

U.S. President-elect Trump has announced his intention to impose a blanket tariff ranging from 10% to 20% on all imports, along with additional tariffs of 60% to 100% on products imported from China. Goldman expects the U.S. to impose additional tariffs averaging 20% on Chinese products in the first half of 2025.",Nov 11 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/11/trump-tariff-threat-looms-large-on-many-asian-countries-not-just-china.html
"Harris proposes 1 million forgivable loans to Black entrepreneurs, as Trump makes inroads","Democratic presidential nominee and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris delivers remarks during a campaign event at a fire station, in Redford Charter Township, Michigan U.S., October 4, 2024.

Vice President Kamala Harris unveiled an ""Opportunity Agenda"" proposal for Black men Monday, which includes plans to provide 1 million forgivable loans to Black entrepreneurs and new pathways to help Black Americans succeed in the legalized marijuana industry.

""This agenda is a further realization of Vice President Harris' Opportunity Economy,"" said former Rep. Cedric Richmond, a Harris campaign co-chair, in a statement. ""An economy where people don't just get by, but get ahead. Where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.""

Harris' announcement is aimed at increasing her support among Black male voters, and comes in the final weeks of an extremely close race between the Democratic vice president and Republican former President Donald Trump.

The plan outlined Monday would provide 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs and others to start a business. The loans would be financed through partnerships between ""mission-driven lenders,"" community oriented banks and the Small Business Administration, the campaign said.

The agenda also includes training and mentorship programs to help Black men get jobs in high-demand industries, and greater investments in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to recruit and retain Black male teachers.

The PSLF program provides student loan forgiveness after 10 years to borrowers who work in certain nonprofit and government jobs. Black men make up less than 2% of public school teachers in the U.S., according to the findings of the National Teacher and Principal Survey for the 2020-21 school year.

A victory in November would make Harris the first Black woman and the first South Asian person ever elected president of the United States.

What a potential Harris administration could actually do to protect abortion access,"Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at Shell Energy Stadium in Houston, Texas, Oct. 25, 2024. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images

Vice President Kamala Harris has made abortion a central issue in her bid for the White House, pledging that if elected she will expand and protect women's ability to terminate a pregnancy. The vice president's promises come as the country still reels from the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed the constitutional right to abortion in the U.S. for half a century. Since that ruling, 13 states have completely banned abortions. ""One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to simply agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body,"" Harris said during her closing remarks Tuesday evening at the Ellipse lawn in Washington. In response, the crowd of more than 60,000 supporters cheered loudly. But what could Harris actually do to support abortion access in a post-Roe landscape? The question is central to a key dynamic underway in the presidential election: a partisan gender divide with few precedents in modern politics. An October NBC News poll showed a gender gap of 30 percentage points between Harris and Republican Donald Trump, with male voters breaking for Trump by 16% and female voters for Harris by 14%. This split between male and female voters is inextricably tied to the issue of abortion. According to the final New York Times election poll, abortion and the economy were tied among female likely voters as their top issue. Among all registered voters, men and women, only the economy ranked higher than abortion in its impact on voter choices. If Harris were elected president, however, she would likely find it very difficult to restore the right to an abortion nationwide, said Alina Salganicoff, a senior vice president and the director of the Women's Health Policy Program at nonprofit health research organization KFF. Even so, she said, a Harris administration could increase the availability of medication abortions and, crucially, it could fight Republican and activist attempts to further limit reproductive rights.

Restoring Roe-era protections is unlikely

Restoring a right to abortion across the U.S. would be challenging, if not impossible, experts say. It would require a significant change in the composition of the Supreme Court or an act of Congress. ""Both are hard to imagine in the near future,"" Salganicoff said. Harris has said she would sign a bill from Congress reestablishing abortion rights, but it's unlikely such legislation would reach the Senate's current 60-vote threshold. A bill in May 2022 that would effectively codify a right to abortion failed in the Senate, with a 49-51 vote. All Republicans opposed the measure.

Some Democratic lawmakers, including Harris, have voiced support for eliminating the filibuster in the Senate, which would allow bills to pass with a simple majority instead of the 60 votes currently required to end debate over legislation and advance it in the 100-member Senate. ""I've been very clear, I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe, and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom,"" Harris said in September during an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio. It's uncertain Democrats will secure even a simple majority in the Senate in the Nov. 5 election, which would be necessary to undo the filibuster, said Mary Ziegler, a legal historian of the U.S. abortion debate. However, that could change in the 2026 midterm elections, Ziegler said. Even with enough votes, some Democrats may worry that lowering the Senate voting threshold could backfire on them and abortion access, she said. ""Democrats historically have been anxious about that because then they don't have tools to defeat a new abortion ban if Republicans were to pass one,"" Ziegler said.

Other ways of protecting abortion in the U.S.

Harris supports a repeal of the Hyde Amendment, a congressional rider that limits federal spending on abortions to cases of rape, incest or life-threatening pregnancies. As a result of the restriction, women on Medicaid can be forced to pay out-of-pocket for an abortion, which can cost $600 or more in some cases. The provision affects low-income women and women of color the most, experts say. ""Harris has been really vocal about supporting the repeal of the Hyde Amendment,"" Ziegler said. But once again, ""she'd need Congress"" to do so, Ziegler said. ""If Democrats don't control Congress, it's going to be hard."" Still, she added, ""Having a president pushing for it would be significant.""

Harris could also pursue several paths to make medication abortions more available. In 2023, medication abortions accounted for 63% of abortions in the U.S., a rise from 53% in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute. ""There are likely many reasons for the increase, including the relatively recent availability of abortion medication through telehealth,"" Salganicoff at KFF said, adding that Harris could look for more ways to make the pills accessible. A Harris administration would not enforce the Comstock Act, a controversial federal law passed in 1873 that bans the mailing of obscene matter. In the conservative governing blueprint Project 2025, which former President Donald Trump has tried to disavow, the authors call for using the Victorian-era law as another kind of abortion ban, prohibiting using the mail to distribute abortion pills and other abortion-related materials. ""They're arguing that if Planned Parenthood orders a scalpel from a medical supply company, that's a federal crime,"" Ziegler said.

Regardless of who wins the White House, an anti-abortion group could bring a case to the Supreme Court and persuade the justices that the Comstock Act should be applied as a ban on mailing abortion materials, Ziegler said. But enforcement of that ruling would be left to the U.S. Department of Justice, she said, and that would be another area where Harris could make a difference. ""A Harris administration wouldn't be able to change what the Supreme Court is saying, but it could de-prioritize those prosecutions,"" Ziegler said. ""The DOJ always has limited resources, and prioritizes some prosecutions over others.""

Harris could also oppose efforts by Republicans and anti-abortion groups to invalidate the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, which is used to terminate pregnancies, experts said. Her administration would also likely fight other legal challenges to further restrict abortions, such as state laws that ban emergency abortion care for patients when their health is in jeopardy. The Biden administration has argued that depriving people of this care violates the EMTALA, or the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. That federal law requires hospitals to offer health-preserving treatment to those in need who come in to their emergency rooms. ""Several states with abortion bans only have a life exception, not one for health,"" Salganicoff said.

"Mark Cuban says 'It's the Harris campaign vs. Elon,' not Trump","Vice President Kamala Harris is campaigning for president against Elon Musk at least as much as she is against former President Donald Trump, Mark Cuban said Monday, as he advocated for the Democratic nominee as the pro-business choice.

""It's the Harris campaign versus Elon, not even versus Trump,"" the billionaire investor and former ""Shark Tank"" host said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

Cuban took a swipe at the Tesla and SpaceX CEO over Musk's promise to give $1 million per day to the winner of a swing-state voter sweepstakes, calling it ""innovative"" and ""desperate.""

But Cuban later predicted that if Harris wins, she ""100%"" could mend her relationship with Musk.

Cuban's remarks were the latest volley between the two billionaires, who have taken on increasingly prominent campaign roles while ramping up attacks against each other.

Musk, who has contributed tens of millions of dollars to a pro-Trump super PAC, repeatedly mocked Cuban's looks, after Cuban said that few other CEOs are backing the GOP nominee.

Cuban shot back on Thursday: ""You can't stop thinking about me @elonmusk Can you?""

""It's ok. I understand. If I supported a candidate that was so incompetent I had to take over and fund their ground game, I would be looking for a distraction too,"" Cuban added in the post on X, the social media platform Musk owns.

Cuban called out Musk again Monday morning on CNBC.

Asked for his view on the latest polls, which broadly show a neck-and-neck race between Harris and Trump, Cuban said, ""Nobody really knows, and so really it comes down to get out the vote.""

""And the crazy thing is, it's the Harris campaign versus Elon, not even versus Trump,"" said Cuban.

Musk, the world's richest man, has indeed emerged as one of the Trump campaign's most prominent surrogates, as well as one of the biggest spenders in the 2024 election. He has led get-out-the-vote efforts in the key swing state of Pennsylvania and given nearly $75 million to his America PAC between July and early September alone.

Trump now regularly boasts of having Musk's support, and has suggested that the CEO could take on a prominent role in his administration if he wins the election.

Musk, in turn, is embracing his status as one of Trump's top backers.

On Saturday, Musk said he would randomly give $1 million per day to registered voters who sign a petition for that PAC.

""It's innovative and it's desperate,"" Cuban said of that giveaway on CNBC. ""You only do that because you think you have to.""

Cuban conceded that a sweepstakes is ""not a bad idea,"" but he wasn't convinced that it would work.

""It just as easily could backfire,"" he said, ""but you don't know until you try.""

Cuban went on to deliver a multipronged argument for Harris as a better presidential candidate for small businesses and the economy while contrasting her with Trump.

He said that Harris has promised not to raise taxes on Americans making $400,000 a year or less, which Cuban noted is a group that covers most small-business owners.

Cuban, the founder of Cost Plus Drugs, also pointed to Harris' focus on lowering health care and pharmaceutical prices by taking on pharmacy middlemen. He argued that those savings could offset inflation for households and small businesses.

""She has come out and talked about it. Donald Trump hasn't said a word.""

He also argued that Harris' approach to addressing illegal immigration would be better for businesses than the mass-deportation plan put forward by Trump.

""I sat in front of restaurant owners and I asked, 'What would it be like if all of a sudden you've got a knock on your door and there was somebody from Stephen Miller squad asking you for the names and addresses and immigration status of everybody that works for you?'"" Cuban said.

""That's not how you can run a country.""

Cuban also repeated his criticisms of Trump's vow to use sweeping tariffs as a main tool of both his economic and foreign policy. Cuban said it was ""insane"" that Trump proposed using tariffs to deter a Chinese incursion into Taiwan.",Oct 21 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/cuban-harris-elon-musk-trump-election.html

President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is planning to kill the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Ending the tax credit could have grave implications for an already stalling U.S. EV transition. And yet representatives of Tesla — by far the nation's largest EV seller — have told a Trump-transition committee they support ending the subsidy, said the two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Elon Musk, one of Trump's biggest backers and the world's richest person, said earlier this year that killing the subsidy might slightly hurt Tesla sales but would devastate its U.S. EV competitors, which include legacy automakers such as General Motors . Repealing the subsidy, which has been a signature measure of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is being discussed in meetings by an energy-policy transition team led by billionaire oilman Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, the two sources said.

The group has had several meetings since Trump's Nov. 5 election victory, including some at his Florida Mar-a-Lago club, where Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has also spent considerable time since the election. Representatives with the Trump transition and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing nearly all major automakers besides Tesla, also did not immediately respond. The alliance last month in an Oct. 15 letter urged Congress to retain the EV tax credits, calling them ""critical to cementing the U.S. as a global leader in the future of automotive technology and manufacturing."" Trump repeatedly pledged to end Biden's ""EV mandate"" on the campaign trail, without spelling out specific targeted policies. The energy-focused transition team has determined that some of the clean-energy policies in Biden's IRA will be tough to roll back given that the programs have already started allocating money, including to Republican-dominated states where the programs are popular, the sources said. Trump's energy transition team views the consumer EV credit as an easy target, believing that eliminating it would get broad consensus in a Republican-controlled Congress as part of a larger tax-reform bill.

Trump picks Rep. Matt Gaetz as attorney general,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., is seen outside the U.S. Capitol after the last votes before the August recess on Thursday, July 25, 2024.

President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will nominate Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida as U.S. attorney general.

Gaetz has submitted his resignation from Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson revealed at a news conference Wednesday evening. The resignation will not take effect until it is announced on the House floor.

Trump, in his Truth Social post announcing Gaetz's selection, wrote that the 42-year-old lawmaker ""has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice.""

Gaetz replied on X, ""It will be an honor to serve as President Trump's Attorney General!""

The selection is the clearest example yet of how Trump, having sworn off many of his former staffers as ""RINOs"" — Republicans in Name Only — or enemies of him and his MAGA agenda, is making loyalty a key qualification for his second administration.

If the Senate confirms him, Gaetz will succeed Attorney General Merrick Garland, who led the Department of Justice as it conducted a sex-trafficking investigation of the congressman.

The DOJ ultimately declined to charge Gaetz.

Gaetz has been the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation into whether he engaged in sexual misconduct or illicit drug use.

But Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday that ""the House Ethics Committee would have no further jurisdiction over the person, no further authority over them"" if they were no longer in Congress.

House Ethics Chair Michael Guest, R-Miss., told reporters earlier Wednesday, ""If Mr. Gaetz were to resign because he is taking a position with the administration as the Attorney General, then the Ethics Committee loses jurisdiction at that point.""

Gaetz, who has denied any wrongdoing, in September said that he would no longer voluntarily participate in the panel's probe.

Punchbowl News reported Wednesday that his resignation came just two days before the panel was set to vote on releasing a report on its probe.

The lawmaker, who has carved out a reputation as a staunch and vocal Trump loyalist, has aggressively criticized the DOJ investigation and prosecution of the president-elect by special counsel Jack Smith.

In October 2023, Gaetz filed the original motion to oust then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, his fellow Republican. A band of eight Republicans led by Gaetz would ultimately join with all House Democrats in removing McCarthy as speaker, plunging the GOP conference into chaos.

Gaetz was traveling with Trump, billionaire Elon Musk and others Wednesday during the president-elect's first trip to Washington, D.C., since defeating Vice President Kamala Harris, NBC News reported.

Trump's selection of Gaetz came as a major surprise even to his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill.

Just a day earlier, Johnson, whose projected majority had already been slimmed after Trump tapped GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to join his incoming administration, said, ""I don't expect that we will have more members leaving.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told Punchbowl News she was ""shocked"" by Gaetz's selection.

""This is why the Senate's advise and consent process is so important,"" Collins told the news outlet. ""I'm sure that there will be many, many questions raised at Mr. Gaetz's hearing.""

Asked by a HuffPost reporter whether Gaetz has the character to be attorney general, Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, replied, ""Are you s------- me?""",Nov 13 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/trump-taps-rep-matt-gaetz-as-attorney-general.html
Trump's election victory sparks dismay — and defiance — among architects of the Paris climate accord,"Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, listens to a question as he visits Chez What Furniture Store which was damaged during Hurricane Helene on September 30, 2024 in Valdosta, Georgia.

Donald Trump's election victory on Wednesday sparked a palpable sense of dismay among the climate community, with two key architects of the landmark Paris Agreement warning that the result will stall global efforts to protect the environment.

Trump will defeat his Democratic rival Kamala Harris and return to the White House for a second four-year term, according to an NBC News projection.

It marks a historic and somewhat improbable comeback for one of the most polarizing figures in modern American politics.

The 78-year-old, who has called the climate crisis ""one of the great scams,"" has pledged to ramp-up fossil fuel production, pare back outgoing President Joe Biden's emissions-limiting regulations and pull the country out of the Paris climate accord — again.

The 2015 Paris Agreement is a critically important framework designed to reduce planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions. It aims to ""limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels"" over the long term.

Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Agreement, said Trump's election victory ""is a setback for global climate action, but the Paris Agreement has proven resilient and is stronger than any single country's policies.""

Tubiana, a French economist and diplomat who now serves as CEO of the European Climate Foundation, said the context today is ""very different"" to Trump's first election victory in 2016.",Nov 6 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trumps-election-victory-sparks-dismay-among-climate-community.html
"Nate Silver: Don't trust the Trump swing in 2024 presidential election polls, betting markets data","Data expert Nate Silver is known for making big calls on elections and at the poker table, and right now, those two worlds have converged as both presidential election polls and betting markets show momentum building for Donald Trump and declining for Kamala Harris with less than a week to go before Election Day.

Silver is on the record since last week as saying the odds favor Trump — he laid out his call in a New York Times op-ed — but he also described it as a ""gut instinct"" rather than more certain data science. In an interview with CNBC's ""Closing Bell: Overtime"" anchor Jon Fortt at the CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit in New York City on Tuesday, Silver laid out several big caveats about current polling and betting markets.

Silver told Fortt that his current model shows the odds favoring Trump, who holds a 55% to 45% win probability advantage over Harris.

But he also said for any anecdotal example he can offer as to why Trump's momentum is peaking, ""there is a counter example.""

Trump's momentum in the polls has narrowed or erased Harris's lead in some key swing states, but Silver says he thinks that after two cycles in a row in which the polls were ""pretty bad"" and plenty of criticism pointed at the polling industry ever since 2016, ""a lot of pollsters are throwing up their hands.""

""They're printing a tie,"" Silver said at the CNBC event, giving the example of a hypothetical pollster conversation: ""'Harris is up 3%? Let's say 1%. Trump up by 4? Let's say 1.5%. There is what we call herding, where people are gravitating towards the consensus. They don't want opinions too out of line.""

Another factor that could be skewing the polls is if Trump's voters are more ""charged up and excited,"" which might lead them to partake in more polls than they have historically, and lead Harris-leaning voters to partake in polls less.

Political polling is never as precise as people expect, Silver said, noting that in most scenarios if you modeled a 52%-48% edge and it turned out to be the reverse, that would still be pretty close. But political polling is an exception, and it is getting even more difficult for the polls to get things right.

The polls in recent elections have been off by three to four points ""systematically, across the board,"" Silver said, so recent small swings in polls favoring Trump are ""swamped by the uncertainty ... tripping off the noise, basically,"" he said.

Five percent of people answer polls, ""and they are weird,"" Silver said.

Most people no longer even have the landline phones which past election cycle polling history relied on. ""Old white people answer the phone, but others vote,"" he added.

Why the betting markets may be all 'vibe and chatter'

The betting markets show a much bigger edge for Trump, with major wagers placed on Polymarket, Robinhood jumping into the action, and presidential election contracts surging in popularity.

Wall Street research reports from big banks and billionaire investors including Ken Griffin and Stanley Druckenmiller have been pointing to recent action in stocks and bonds as a sign that there is greater conviction about a second term for Trump. Shares of Trump Media , which runs the former president's Truth Social social-media platform, had surged in recent trading, too, though they remain extremely volatile, down 22% on Wednesday.

Critics have raised concerns that the election betting markets are potentially being manipulated. But Silver, who is a consultant to one of the leading prediction markets, Polymarket, says he wouldn't pay much attention to the betting markets data right now, as they simply may not be very accurate at this moment in the election cycle. In principle, they can account for additional information such as early voting and historical data, but there is limited historical data on elections for the prediction markets to use as a basis for accuracy, making most of these calls ""calibrated based on vibe and chatter"" rather than useful information, Silver said.",Oct 30 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/nate-silver-dont-trust-trump-swing-in-polling-prediction-markets.html
"Harris distances herself from Biden, bashes Trump in tense Fox News interview","Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris arrives for a campaign event at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan, October 4, 2024.

Kamala Harris on Wednesday distanced herself from President Joe Biden and bashed her Republican presidential rival Donald Trump in a heated interview with Fox News anchor Brett Baier.

""Let me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency,"" Harris said on the conservative news network, after Baier pressed her on whether the vice president would do anything differently than the incumbent.

""And like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas,"" the Democratic nominee said.

The 26-minute interview on Fox's ""Special Report"" was focused heavily on the issue of immigration, and Harris again blamed Trump for killing a bipartisan bill aimed at addressing the crisis at the southern border.

The interview was tense from the first exchange, when Baier repeatedly interrupted Harris' opening answer about immigration.

""You have to let me finish please ... I'm in the middle of responding to the point you're raising, and I'd like to finish,"" Harris said early on.",Oct 16 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/16/harris-trump-biden-fox-news-interview.html

Harris plays cleanup on Biden 'garbage' comment,"Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris talks to reporters before boarding Air Force Two at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on October 30, 2024.

Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday distanced herself from President Joe Biden's controversial comment that appeared to label supporters of former President Donald Trump as ""garbage.""

""I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,"" Harris told reporters before the Democratic presidential nominee flew to Raleigh, North Carolina, for campaign events.

""You heard my speech last night. I believe the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not,"" Harris said. ""I will be a president for all Americans.""

Harris also said that Biden had ""clarified"" the comment he made Tuesday.

But she underscored that her campaign is searching for any votes that she can get — and is anxious not to lose any — with less than a week before Election Day.

""I'm going to be spending full time talking to people no matter who they voted last time,"" Harris said.

The vice president said she had spoken with Biden on Tuesday night, but that they did not discuss what he had said earlier in the night.

Biden had been on a video call Tuesday about outreach to Latino voters, when the conversation turned to the several racist jokes comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made at a rally for the GOP nominee and former president in New York City on Sunday.

""Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage,'"" Biden said on the call.

""They're good, decent, honorable people,"" Biden said, referring to Puerto Ricans. ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American. It's totally contrary to everything we've done.""

That comment quickly drew criticism from Republicans backing Trump. Within hours, the White House took the rare step of releasing a revised transcript of Biden's remarks. In this version, it seemed that Biden was saying the ""garbage"" was Hinchcliffe's demonization of Latinos, not Trump supporters.

Biden himself then took the even more unusual step of making his own statement, insisting he did not mean to call Trump supporters ""garbage.""

""Earlier today, I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,"" Biden said in a tweet on X late Tuesday night.

""His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.""

Despite the cleanup efforts, Biden's comment — mangled or otherwise — threw a monkey wrench into the Harris campaign's plan to highlight her pledge to govern for all Americans, regardless of party.

Instead, Harris allies appearing on Wednesday's morning news shows had to answer questions about what Biden said.

Biden's comment also complicated the Harris campaign's plan to exploit the backlash to Hinchcliffe's joke about Puerto Rico.

Pennsylvania, which is perhaps the most prized swing state in the 2024 election, has nearly 500,000 Puerto Rican residents, who represent the largest share of Latino voters in the state.

Hinchcliffe's comment threatened to alienate at least some Puerto Rican voters in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.

In the 2016 election, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania by fewer than 45,000 votes, or less than 1% of the vote.

In 2020, Biden beat Trump in the state by fewer than 81,000 votes, a margin of less than 1.2%.",Oct 30 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/harris-rejects-biden-garbage-comment-trump-election.html
Kamala Harris could make history as America’s first woman president: What do women think about it?,"We're days away from what could be a historic election, in a highly unusual campaign season. America could get its first female president in Kamala Harris, a late entrant to the race. But unlike in 2016, when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee for the job, gender has not been a major talking point throughout the campaign. That seems to be intentional by Harris, who chooses to focus on policy over her identity. But what do women voters think about the possibility of having the first-ever female president, and where does it fall on their list of priorities? The gender split at the polls is wide: Harris leads Donald Trump among women by 54% to 42%, while Trump leads Harris among men, 55% percent to 41%, according to The New York Times/Siena College Poll between Oct. 20 to 23. CNBC Make It spoke with women across the U.S. about the issues influencing their vote. We spoke to students, mid-career professionals, executives and small-business owners who identify as Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Some of the women we talked to still feel scarred by getting their hopes up for a Clinton win in 2016, and feel less excited and more jaded about seeing a woman on the ballot again. Others said that, regardless of the outcome, this election represents progress by helping to normalize the idea of a woman as U.S. president. Here's a snapshot of what women think about having a female candidate at the top of the ballot for just the second time in history: Interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.

It's comforting to see another woman on the presidential ballot. In 2016, when Hillary was the nominee, it felt like this major, crazy shock. But now, it almost feels normal to me. I haven't decided who I'm voting for but gender hasn't influenced what I'm thinking at all. It just comes down to each candidate's policies and who might be the better leader for our country. I do think that seeing a woman on the ballot will, hopefully, encourage more women to vote, even if they don't vote for Harris. It's a great change that's been needed for so long. But I think it's going to be a major adjustment for everybody in the U.S. no matter who wins the election.

Annie Lazan, 24, human resources assistant in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey

In 2016, I really was so confident that we would elect our first woman president. I remember going to the polls with my mom and older sister, and being so proud to watch them cast their vote for [Hillary] Clinton, and we all woke up shocked when she lost to Trump. I'll be voting for Harris, and I hope that one day, I can tell my children that I played a role in electing our first woman president. But I'm not just voting for her because of her gender, I think she's truly qualified for the job. I mean, her track record is phenomenal. I know politics are complicated, and I don't think it's fair to expect her to be some kind of savior and fix all of the problems in the U.S. But I've appreciated a lot of the promises she's made during the campaign, and whether or not she makes good on them, it feels like a step in the right direction for our country.

Bushra Amiwala, 26, member of the Skokie School District Board of Education, Chicago, Illinois

In 2016, it seemed beyond overdue that we would have our first woman president in the U.S., and it garnered so much momentum and excitement. But I think today, seeing a woman on the ballot simply isn't enough. It doesn't feel as exciting or charming. Sometimes I wonder if we are being lenient and not pressing Harris as hard on certain issues, just because people want to see a woman in office. I probably will be voting for Vice President Harris, but I have conflicted feelings about it. On the one hand, she's been part of the same administration that's been involved in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and as a Muslim American, that's an important issue to me. I know a lot of people who live in non-swing states who are choosing to vote third party for this purpose of making a statement that candidates need to earn their vote, and they're not impressed with Harris' approach to a lot of issues. We're not just going to applaud because this is a candidate that looks like us, that's beyond the minimum at this point.

Sydney Van Dyke, 27, library worker in Overland Park, Kansas

My first election that I was able to vote in was the 2016 election with Clinton versus Trump. At the time, I thought it was going to be a landslide, like 'We're about to have our first woman president.' I was a little more excited back then, because I had a certain faith in humanity that I don't really have anymore. And so I'm excited, on the one hand, because we have a woman candidate again, and she is a person of color this time. And I think that's a step in the right direction, but it's just worrisome to me who she's up against. I feel like a lot of the novelty of a woman running for president ran out after the 2016 election, which is crazy. It just kind of feels like I have show up and do this because the world might end. I'm being dramatic, but that's how it feels. A second Trump presidency sounds like it would just be a bad thing for everyone.

It’s emotional just to be alive during a time where a woman is even on the ballot. Sess Lee, 37

Lauren Simmons, 30, author of ""Make Money Move"" in Los Angeles

It always feels significant seeing a woman on the ballot. I was really excited seeing all the women candidates going through the presidential nomination, Republican and Democrat. I was excited for Nikki Haley. When there are more women in the pool and more conversations that represent women and the issues that we go through, and holding a seat at the highest power in the world – it's just a beautiful experience. I think we have been ready for a woman president. The numbers show back in 2016 we were ready. Hillary won the popular vote. That momentum hasn't been lost. I am cautiously optimistic. Not because I'm not ready for there to be a female president, but because no one wants to go through that heartbreak a second time.

Signe Espinoza, 31, executive director at Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Advocates in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania

Abortion is top of mind for me heading into this election. I want to ensure that all women have full access to sexual, reproductive health care in this country. It's been really special and powerful to see Kamala Harris prioritize this issue during her role as vice president and throughout her campaign. I'm looking forward to seeing Harris win. I never thought I'd see a woman of color, someone who looks like me, on the presidential ticket in my lifetime. Women know how to get things done. I think she brings incredible lived experience and perspective that our country needs in this moment to move forward.

Brianna Doe, 31, founder of Verbatim, a marketing agency, in Phoenix

One of the candidates being a woman is not the reason why I'm voting for her, but her way of approaching women's health and bodily autonomy does play a huge role. For lack of a better term, I'm scared about what the future holds for myself and for my future children if I have children. I think a significant portion of the U.S. is ready for a woman president. I also think there's a significant portion of the U.S. that is not ready, and I will say that one thing that scares me if she gets elected — the backlash. I don't think everybody in the U.S. will ever be ready for a woman president, but I don't think everybody in the U.S. was ready for a Black president either.

Sami Sage, 35, co-founder of Betches Media in New York City

The future of our free democracy is my biggest concern. I would like to be able to have another free and fair election and have them for the rest of my life. It is impossible to separate the candidates' genders from who they are and the standards they've been held to. It's not the deciding factor — I wouldn't vote for every woman or not vote for every man. In this case, the candidates' genders have shaped who they are in a particular way that has led to the behaviors and morals that I do and don't align with.

Sess Lee, 37, hair salon owner in Arlington, Texas

It's emotional just to be alive during a time where a woman is even on the ballot. We've come so far. I'm planning to vote for Kamala. What I respect about her is that she not only has an impressive resume working in law and politics, but she has a blended family. She decided not to have children of her own and makes no apologies for it. Hearing her speak about her ambition and the unfair expectations placed on women has empowered so many women of different colors, of different cultures. Even if Kamala wins, I don't think everybody in the U.S. is ready for a woman president, just like they weren't ready for a Black president. She's been getting torn apart ten times worse than Trump on this campaign. But I think Kamala can handle the heat, and overall, I'm excited to see what she accomplishes as president if she wins.

Ariel Washington, 39, works in health-care consulting in Lincoln, Nebraska

I don't know if my gender does factor into my vote. It's wonderful to be able to vote for a woman, but I am most concerned with the policies that the person has. It is exciting to see somebody just younger in the office. It is exciting to see a woman running for office that could actually win it. That's not why I'm voting for her. It is truly the policies that she says that she stands for, and I don't agree with her on everything. The bar is higher for her. Things that are fine for the other candidate to do are not fine for her. The attacks have been particularly sexist in nature. It is different. And so for her to be able to still be the nominee and still be polling where she's polling, and this be a close race, does definitely feel significant. She had to be that much better and on a shorter timeline than normal for a presidential campaign to get where she is. So I think that's a big deal.

Nadia Rahman, 39, digital communications consultant and political organizer in San Francisco

I have decided that I am not voting for either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. My number one issue is the genocide in Gaza and the U.S.'s role it being complicit in it. I am Muslim American. I am also Pakistani American. I'm not Palestinian myself, but I'm an ally to the Palestinian community. Not only is it the moral question of the genocide in Gaza and the Biden-Harris administration's role in it, but … the way it's being portrayed in the media here has skyrocketed the level of anti-Arab racism and Islamophobia. The only thing that could change my mind would be going beyond the empty calls for a ceasefire, like actually securing a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before the election, and putting an arms embargo on Israel to stop the murder.

The main question I'm asking myself heading into this election is: Are we better off today than we were four years ago? Jill Homan, 49

Adriane Schwager, 41, CEO of GrowthAssistant, a hiring platform, in St. Louis, Missouri

I think we have a fundamental issue of the rights around women's bodies being part of the government, and while that is a political issue, I believe there will always be an unfair power dynamic of having control over one gender's bodies but not another. In that way, how can you actually really be equal? I'd love for a woman to be elected U.S. president in my lifetime and in my child's lifetime for younger generations of America to see that actually more than one gender can sit in that office. The impressions that are made now really play to the voting decisions of the future, too.

Meghan O'Connor, 45, resource specialist for a fundraising organization in Kansas City, Missouri

I've got several transgender members of my family, and there's been a lot of hype and fear-mongering around transgender people during this election. So it's very important to me to have a candidate who will keep my family safe and allow them the rights to be a human and have access to appropriate medical care. The fact that we have so many young women going out to register to vote is important, and I think that is going to make a difference in the polls and in the numbers we have voting for Harris. I think Harris is just bringing a lot of new people into the process who haven't necessarily felt included before.

Jill Homan, 49, finance executive in Archer Lodge, North Carolina

The main question I'm asking myself heading into this election is: Are we better off today than we were four years ago? For me, that answer is no. I was better off in a Trump administration. The most important issues to me, as a voter, are the economy and immigration, and I just think Trump is the better candidate to address those issues. People are feeling the strain of this economy, and I think people are also feeling the strain under Harris' lack of leadership as vice president. I think Americans and myself want to change course and put us in a better direction. As a member of the LGBTQ community, too, I do believe Trump is a terrific ally and has been a strong supporter on issues in that space; I know people disagree. As a woman and a mother, I'm a fierce defender of maintaining Title IX, and I think Trump is a strong ally on that issue as well. What you'll find with Republicans is that we're not leading with the color of our skin or our gender or sexual identity. That's not how we identify. We identify first as Americans. So I'm supporting Trump because of his policies, and his plan to make our country stronger.

Dr. Jennifer Ashton, 55, founder and president of Ajenda, a women's health company, in New York City

I just sent in my ballot for Harris, and I wasn't totally happy about it. I'm what I call a financial conservative and a social moderate or liberal. On the issues, I come down as a centrist, which is why I'm now a registered Independent. I've found it really hard to tease out differences between the individual and the party. With Harris, I like the individual, but I don't like a lot of what the party is standing for today. And I can say with Trump, I don't like the individual and don't like a lot of what the party is standing for today, but there are things that I do support. As a physician and as a women's health specialist, I'm incredibly concerned with the jeopardy and the effect on women's lives and men's lives as a result of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. I think that it puts everyone, not just women, in a very precarious health situation. It really comes down to who's leading the parties at any given time. To me, what's really needed now more than ever is a leader who is an incredible communicator. Going back to the pandemic, which I covered extensively as the chief medical correspondent for ABC News, we saw the pitfalls of poor communication, and I think that that was part of the impetus for the endemic of misinformation and disinformation that we're seeing right now, whether it's in health or politics.

Sallie Krawcheck, 59, CEO and founder of Ellevest in New York City

The most important issues to me in this election are any and all issues that affect women and their families, and that help them financially. So that is not just about which candidate can drive a stronger economy, but also very much about women's reproductive rights and paid family leave. Instead of asking 'Is the U.S ready for a woman president?' maybe the better question is if the U.S. will be better off with a woman president and the different perspective she would bring?

13 former Trump administration officials sign open letter backing up John Kelly's criticism of Trump,"White House chief of staff John Kelly listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a briefing with senior military leaders in the Cabinet Room of the White House October 5, 2017 in Washington, D.C.

Thirteen former Trump White House officials signed an open letter backing up former Trump chief of staff John Kelly, who told the New York Times that Trump fits the definition of a fascist.

""We applaud General Kelly for highlighting in stark details the danger of a second Trump term. Like General Kelly, we did not take the decision to come forward lightly,"" the letter said. ""We are all lifelong Republicans who served our country. However, there are moments in history where it becomes necessary to put country over party. This is one of those moments.""

Politico was first to report on the letter.

The letter, released by the Harris campaign, is signed by former officials including former press secretary Stephanie Grisham, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security Miles Taylor, and Olivia Troye, former national security adviser to Mike Pence. All three former Trump administration officials have become high-profile critics of his after his presidency ended.

Troye and Grisham spoke at the Democratic National Convention this year. Troye was also one of the signatories of a letter in August from over 200 Republican officials backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.

In his interview with the Times, released Tuesday, Kelly also said he observed Trump on multiple occasions praising Adolf Hitler. His comments came on the same day the Atlantic reported that Trump said he wished he had generals like Hitler.

In their letter, the former Trump officials said Kelly's claims were ""disturbing and shocking."" They added that ""because we know Trump and have worked for and alongside him, we were sadly not surprised by what General Kelly had to say. This is who Donald Trump is.""

Trump on Thursday denied ever having said positive things about Adolf Hitler, including that he needed ""the kind of generals that Hitler had.""

The Harris campaign has been highlighting Kelly's comments about his former boss, releasing a new ad on Thursday using Kelly's audio published by The New York Times.

In remarks Wednesday, Harris said that Kelly's claims are ""a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best, from the people who worked with him side by side in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.""

She added that ""in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions.""

A Harris campaign official told NBC News that the campaign's focus group of undecided voters this week found Kelly credible and non-partisan, leading some to further question voting for Trump.",Oct 25 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/25/13-former-trump-administration-officials-sign-open-letter-backing-up-john-kellys-criticism-of-trump.html
"Trump again refuses to release current health records, as Harris questions his fitness","Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, addresses the media as he arrives at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport on October 18, 2024, in Detroit, Michigan.

Donald Trump on Friday dismissed more questions about whether he would release his current medical records, doubling down on refusing to provide a health update even as Kamala Harris works to sow doubts about his fitness for the presidency.

The 78-year-old Republican nominee, when asked if he will release his health records, suggested that he has already shared enough information about his medical status.

""Yeah, my health records – I've done five exams over the last four years. You've got them all,"" Trump told a reporter on an airport tarmac after landing in Detroit, Michigan, on Friday afternoon.

Trump then appeared to suggest that he was too busy campaigning against Vice President Harris, the Democratic nominee, to devote time to update his records.

""Obviously, I'm in the middle of a very big and very contentious fight,"" he said. ""We're leading. I've given my health exams.""

Trump added that he has ""done cognitive tests twice, and I've aced them. Meaning a perfect score.""

""I want to see her do a cognitive test because she couldn't ace because she wasn't born smart,"" he said, before walking away from the press.

The Trump campaign did not respond to CNBC's request for additional comment on Trump's remarks in Michigan.

Trump told CBS News in August that he would ""very gladly"" release his medical records, but his campaign has not done so.

Harris, who turns 60 on Sunday, released a detailed health report from her White House doctor on Oct. 12. That same day, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung claimed in a statement that the Republican nominee ""has voluntarily released"" multiple health reports.

Cheung pointed to a three-paragraph letter from Dr. Bruce Aronwald, which was shared last November and related to an exam of Trump that was conducted more than a year ago.

Cheung also referred to two memos penned in July by Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas, who formerly served as Trump's White House physician. Those memos focused on the injury Trump sustained when he narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a July 13 campaign rally.

Harris, meanwhile, has recently ramped up her health-focused attacks on Trump, who would become the oldest person in U.S. history elected president if he prevails in the Nov. 5 election.

During a rally in North Carolina on Sunday, she put a spotlight on Trump's refusal to release a comprehensive health report, along with his decision not to agree to a second debate.

""It makes you wonder, why does his staff want him to hide away? One must question, one must question, are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America? Is that what's going on?"" Harris said.",Oct 18 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/18/trump-health-records-harris-exhausted.html
Exxon CEO says Trump should keep U.S. involved in global effort to address climate change,"President-elect Donald Trump should keep the U.S. involved in global efforts to address climate change, Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods said Tuesday.

Trump should try to bring a ""common sense"" approach to the annual U.N. Climate Change Conference and ""continue to have the U.S. influence policy around the world,"" Woods told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. Woods spoke from the climate conference, which kicked off this week in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement in 2017 and is expected to do so again in his second term. President Joe Biden signed an order to rejoin the agreement on his first day in office in 2021, a decision that Exxon supported.

Trump slammed the Paris Agreement as ""horribly unfair to the U.S."" and vowed to rescind all unspent funds under the Inflation Reduction Act in an address to the Economic Club of New York in September. He made energy policy a central part of his campaign platform, calling for unconstrained fossil fuel production.

Exxon has plans to invest $20 billion through 2027 in carbon capture and storage technology, hydrogen fuel, and lithium mining in the U.S. for electric vehicle batteries.

Woods told CNBC on Tuesday that Exxon's investments in technologies to lower emissions depend on federal tax credits that were established or expanded under the IRA. He warned that the company's investments in these technologies would change if the incentives are weakened or repealed.

""There needs to be an incentive to reward those investments and generate a return,"" Woods said. ""If we find that those incentives dissipate or go away entirely, then that would definitely change our investment plans.""

Wood previously said Exxon's oil and gas production levels will not change, at least in the short term, in response to the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.

""I'm not sure how 'drill, baby, drill' translates into policy,"" Woods told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Nov. 1, referencing one of Trump's campaign slogans.

The CEO said Exxon has not faced constraints on its shale production under the Biden administration. Exxon's production levels are based on how much money the company can return to shareholders, not which political party is on office, he said.

Biden says Elon Musk was an 'illegal worker' when he began U.S. career,"Biden says Elon Musk was an 'illegal worker' when he began U.S. career
text :  President Joe Biden called out Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, now a Republican megadonor and Trump campaign surrogate, for hypocrisy on immigration on Saturday, saying Musk launched his long career in the U.S. as an ""illegal worker"" before becoming the world's wealthiest man.

The president made these remarks at a campaign event to support Democrats that took place in Pittsburgh on Saturday.

Labeling Musk as former President Donald Trump's wealthy new ""ally,"" Biden said, ""That wealthiest man in the world turned out to be an illegal worker here when he was here,"" referring to Musk.

""He was supposed to be in school when he came on a student visa. He wasn't in school. He was violating the law. He's talking about all these 'illegals' coming our way,"" Biden added.

He then criticized Trump and Republicans for failing to sign legislation that would fix ""the problem with the border."" He added, ""We have fewer people crossing the border illegally now — or crossing the border period — than at any time since his third year as President of the United States.""

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Biden's remarks.

Musk recently completed a series of ""town hall"" events in the same swing state of Pennsylvania, where he sought to convince voters to back Trump and Trump's policies.

Foreign automaker stocks slide on Trump tariff fears,"Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign town hall meeting, moderated by Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in Flint, Michigan, U.S., September 17, 2024. Brian Snyder | Reuters

DETROIT — Stock prices of foreign automakers, including Chinese and German manufacturers, fell sharply on Wednesday amid concerns the U.S. will hike tariffs on imported vehicles under President-elect Donald Trump. European-traded shares of BMW and Mercedes-Benz were off around 6.5%, while Porsche was down by 4.9% and Volkswagen declined 4.3%. Shares of U.S.-traded Chinese automakers such as Li Auto and Nio also were down 3.3% and 5.3%, respectively. Over-the-counter shares of BYD , which aren't publicly listed in the U.S. but can be bought through a broker, declined 4.5%. Trump has repeatedly said he will increase tariffs on many products, including new cars and trucks from China, Europe and Mexico, where many automakers, including Europeans, have established manufacturing hubs. U.S.-traded shares of Japanese automakers Toyota Motor and Honda Motor closed Wednesday up less than 0.5% and down 8%, respectively. Both also reported declines in quarterly earnings earlier in the day. Trump made several proclamations regarding tariffs during his campaign, including calling for a more than 200% duty or tax to be levied on imported vehicles from Mexico. He also has threatened, as he did during his first term in office, to increase imports on European vehicles.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon German automaker stocks

Honda Executive Vice President Shinji Aoyama warned of increased costs to the company's operations if there are increases in tariffs. He said Honda produces roughly 200,000 vehicles annually in Mexico and ships about 160,000 of those to the U.S. ""That is a big impact,"" he said when discussing the company's most recent financial results. ""It is not just Honda. … All of the companies are subjected to the same situation. And, in short, I wouldn't think that the tariff will be imposed soon."" Aoyama later added, ""Maybe we would go for production elsewhere not subject to U.S. tariffs."" Most major automakers have factories in the U.S. However, they still heavily rely on imports from other countries, including Mexico, to meet U.S. consumer demand. General Motors , Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis also have plants in Mexico. So do Toyota, Honda, Hyundai -Kia, Mazda, Volkswagen and others. Under the previously negotiated North American Free Trade deal, and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, that replaced it, automakers increasingly have looked to Mexico as a less expensive place to produce vehicles than in the U.S. or Canada.",Nov 6 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/foreign-auto-stocks-slide-trump-tariff-fears.html
Weak and pathetic': Trump seethes as Mark Cuban campaigns for Harris,"Former President Donald Trump on Saturday railed against fellow billionaire Mark Cuban, who has been vigorously campaigning for his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.

""Mark Cuban is a Loser,"" Trump wrote in a Saturday Truth Social post. ""Wouldn't take his phone calls anymore while at the White House, and he went rogue. A weak and pathetic 'bully,' he's got nothing going. Really low clubhead speed, a total non-athlete!""

Trump's insults come several days after Cuban mocked the Republican presidential nominee's tariff proposals at a Harris campaign rally.

""Let me just tell you, this man has so little understanding of tariffs, he thinks that China pays for them,"" Cuban said of Trump at a Harris rally in Wisconsin on Thursday.

Trump has proposed a 20% universal tariff on all imports and an even higher 60% rate for Chinese imports. The plan has faced criticism from economists, who note that U.S. importers and consumers would ultimately shoulder the cost burden of such a hardline approach.

The animosity between two billionaires is a stark pivot from 2015 when Cuban praised Trump as the ""best thing to happen to politics in a long time,"" in a ""Fox & Friends"" interview.

Trump in turn thanked him for the kind words.

Cuban ended up endorsing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. And in the years since, his once-friendly relationship with Trump has only grown icier.

This election cycle, Cuban has become a regular Harris campaign surrogate as the vice president works to frame herself as a pro-growth capitalist.

The former ""Shark Tank"" host could have his sights on a government position of his own, repeatedly floating the idea of replacing Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, for example.

Meanwhile, Trump has enlisted Elon Musk as his own mega-billionaire campaign surrogate, fueling another rivalry with Cuban.

""You can be one of the world's greatest entrepreneurs literally of the last century and be a f---ing troll at the same time,"" Cuban said of Musk in a Friday interview on ""Real Time With Bill Maher.""",Oct 19 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/19/trump-seethes-mark-cuban-campaigns-harris.html
Trump accuses Taiwan of stealing U.S. chip industry. Here's what the election could bring,"Former President Donald Trump reiterated his frustration with Taiwan over the weekend when he appeared on ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast and accused Taiwan of stealing America's chip industry.

Trump criticized the U.S. CHIPS Act and said he would implement tariffs on chips from Taiwan if elected president. Such tariffs would impact the global leader in chip building, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , whose customers include companies such as Nvidia and Apple .

Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor closed down 4.3% on Monday.

""You know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business ... and they want protection,"" Trump said during his appearance on the podcast, which was published Saturday.

Every hyperscaler working on their own in-house chip, including Amazon , Google and Microsoft , depends on the Taiwanese company for manufacturing. UBS analysts estimate over 90% of the world's advanced chips are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel and Samsung are among the companies trying to compete, but they have faced a series of setbacks.

Given the broader geopolitical concerns surrounding Taiwan and the risk of a China invasion, pressure has been growing on U.S. companies to build an alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor in the U.S.

Intel, which has emerged as a poster child for the CHIPS Act, has faced many challenges. ""We want to get leading-edge infrastructure built here in the U.S., and to be honest, from a policy standpoint, it really shouldn't matter all that much who is building it,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told CNBC.

Rasgon added that the idea that Taiwan had stolen our chips industry is ""ridiculous.""

Taiwan Semiconductor is on tap to receive nearly $7 billion from the U.S. Commerce Department to build its Arizona foundry as part of the CHIPS Act. On the company's earnings call two weeks ago, the company's CEO, CC Wei, said its Arizona plant was making progress, with volumes expected to ramp in 2025.

The U.S. Commerce Department funds have yet to be allocated to Taiwan Semiconductor or other major semiconductor firms. Funds are expected to be allocated by the end of this year as long as specific milestones are met.

Trump also suggested foreign companies shouldn't be able to enter the U.S. and use government money. ""That chip deal is so bad,"" he said. ""We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in and borrow the money and build chip companies here. They're not going to give us the good companies anyway.""

Mizuho analysts recently wrote that a Trump win would be bad for Taiwan Semiconductor. Analysts at Citi are debating how much tariffs could increase the costs across the chip supply chain. They add that tariffs wouldn't be easy for governments to navigate. ""[Tariffs] would require complex audits across thousand of devices, which contain a variety of chips,"" the Citi analysts wrote.

Markets have been keeping a close eye on the risk surrounding Taiwan, given how dependent Silicon Valley is on Taiwan Semiconductor's chips. Earlier this summer, when Trump made similar comments about Taiwan, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) lost $675 billion in market cap in one week. Taiwan Semiconductor fell more than 10%.

U.S. companies that either have manufacturing facilities or are in the process of building them, such as Intel, Global Foundries and Texas Instruments, outperformed on the expectation that if Trump wins, he'll favor the domestic players.

However, a broader trade war could also challenge the sector. ""[Under a Trump presidency], there are potentially big tariffs against China, which, as we have seen before, will elicit a China reaction as we saw with Micron,"" Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy and a top-ranked tech analyst, told CNBC.

But experts warn that if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the election, it's not an ""all clear"" for the semi trade. Some of the harshest export controls on China implemented under the Biden administration dramatically affected how much Nvidia and other semiconductors can sell into the country. Pre-export controls, Nvidia's business in China generated over 25% of total sales. China now accounts for less than 10% of Nvidia's revenue.",Oct 28 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/28/trump-accuses-taiwan-of-stealing-us-chip-business-on-joe-rogan-podcast.html
Lower taxes? Surging crypto? 3 ways a Trump presidency could affect your money,"Former President Donald Trump has won the U.S. presidential election, according to NBC News.

After months on the campaign trail, Trump and running mate J.D. Vance now turn toward enacting the policy agenda they proposed to voters with the help of a Congress that is likely to skew Republican.

The Trump administration inherits an electorate anxious not only about the election itself but also about the candidates' potential impact on the issues that affect their personal finances. Some 57% of investors reported angst or fear surrounding the race's outcome, according to a recent survey from Betterment, with inflation, tax increases and a potential recession among their most common worries.

Leah Millis | Reuters

Now that Donald Trump has been elected president, many individual investors are wondering what that means for their money. The markets rallied last week on news of Trump's win, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing past 44,000 for the first time on Friday. Yet, when it comes to long-term performance of the markets and policies that Trump proposed on the campaign trail, financial advisors say it's best to take a wait-and-see approach before making any big money decisions. ""If clients have a financial plan, have a long-term strategy that meets their goals, our best advice is to stay with that plan and strategy,"" said Jude Boudreaux, a certified financial planner who is a partner with The Planning Center in New Orleans. ""Then we'll make adjustments as more details come forward,"" said Boudreaux, who is also a CNBC FA Council member. Lee Baker, a CFP and owner of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta, said he's also told clients not to make wholesale financial changes now. ""That's not to suggest that, based on the policies, that there might not be tweaks or tilts, depending on how things play out,"" said Baker, who is also a CNBC FA Council member.

Markets may be volatile

The markets reacted favorably to Trump's win. However, it remains to be seen whether that upward trajectory will continue. ""One thing that I've cautioned people about is don't necessarily confuse the market pop that we saw being an affirmation of all things Trump,"" Baker said. Markets generally don't like uncertainty, and experts say the postelection rally is evidence of that.

watch now

""The markets could be reacting with relief that this toss-up election actually really did produce a clear, undisputed winner,"" said CFP Stacy Francis, CEO of Francis Financial, based in New York City. Many investors expect Trump to lead with faster economic growth and more market-friendly policies, said Francis during a Friday webcast on what Trump's presidency could mean for investors' money. Francis is also a CNBC FA Council member. For individual investors, it's still best to base asset allocations on their individual situation, such as personal goals, time horizon and risk tolerance, said Marguerita Cheng, CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Those factors should not change based on the outcome of the election, said Cheng, a CNBC FA Council member. Because Trump is expected to be easier on regulation, some investors expect to see a boost for energy, financial and industrial stocks. To mitigate risk, individuals may get exposure to those sectors by investing in a broad-based index, she said. Ultimately, market moves do not necessarily depend on who is president. ""The stock market tends to perform well no matter which party holds the White House,"" Francis said.

Lower taxes could be extended

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in 2017 during Trump's first presidential term, ushered in lower tax rates. That legislation — which included a higher standard deduction, a $2,000 child tax credit and a $10,000 cap on the state and local deduction — is due to expire at the end of 2025. With Trump's election, many of the tax changes could be extended, advisors say.

Both individuals and corporations are expecting tax cuts with Trump's win, Francis noted during her Friday webcast, which may have also been a factor in last week's stock market surge. ""These tax cuts are expected to lead to somewhat faster economic growth in both 2026 as well as 2027,"" Francis said. On the campaign trail, Trump also floated the idea of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, as well as on tips and overtime pay. While those policies would put more money in Americans' pockets, Francis noted, other experts say it's too soon to count on those changes.

Collinson, who helps lead the international trade and government relations division at the lobbying firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg, said she is fielding ""dozens and dozens and dozens"" of calls from anxious U.S. companies looking to protect themselves from Trump's hardline tariff plans by finding loopholes and exemptions.

""Absolutely everyone is calling,"" Collinson told CNBC. ""It is nonstop.""

Over the course of the 2024 campaign, Trump made universal tariffs a core tenet of his economic platform, floating a 20% tax on all imports from all countries with a specifically harsh 60% rate for Chinese goods.

That hyper-protectionist trade approach sent chills up the spines of economists, Wall Street analysts and industry leaders who warned that across-the-board tariffs could make production — and in turn, consumer prices — more expensive, just as they were recovering from pandemic-era inflation spikes.

""The threat of tariffs has alarmed retailers and a wide range of other U.S. businesses,"" David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, told CNBC. ""Our members have been working on contingency plans since President Trump secured the nomination.""

Ron Sorini, a principal at the lobbying firm Sorini, Samet & Associates, echoed that sentiment, noting that he takes at least two to three calls a day to field companies' concerns about the proposed tariff ramp-up, especially in China.

""[Companies] question where they should go, and how do they get the components out [of China]? How do they get the whole supply chain out?"" Sorini said.",Nov 12 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/trump-tariffs-companies-scramble-lobbyist-loopholes.html
"Capital gains tax hikes 'entirely off the table' under President-elect Trump, Republican Congress, economist says","Former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during an election night event at the West Palm Beach Convention Center on Nov. 6, 2024. Jim Watson | Afp | Getty Images

President-elect Donald Trump's victory means higher individual taxes, including levies on investments, are less likely for top earners, experts say. Vice President Kamala Harris proposed higher long-term capital gains tax rates during her campaign — raising the top rate to 28% from 20% — for those making more than $1 million annually. Long-term capital gains rates apply to assets owned for more than one year. Harris' plan veered from President Joe Biden's 2025 fiscal year budget, which called for 39.6% long-term capital gains taxes on the same top earners. Higher capital gains tax rates, however, are ""entirely off the table,"" under a Trump presidency and Republican-controlled Congress, said Erica York, senior economist and research manager with the Tax Foundation's Center for Federal Tax Policy.

Republicans secured control of the Senate on Tuesday and could maintain a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, which creates a ""trifecta"" in the White House and both chambers of Congress. Even with partial Republican control, ""it's most likely that capital gains tax policy just stays put where it is,"" York explained. For 2024, investors pay long-term capital gains rates of 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on taxable income. Assets owned for one year or less are subject to regular income taxes. You calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income. The taxable income thresholds will increase in 2025.

Changes to 'net investment income tax'

Higher earners also pay the net investment income tax, or NIIT, of 3.8% on capital gains, interest, dividends, rents and more once modified adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds. The MAGI limits for NIIT are $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for married couples filing together and don't adjust for inflation. Combined with long-term capital gains taxes, higher earners currently pay up to 23.8% on investments. ""Republicans may try to get rid of the net investment income tax,"" said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. But ""that's a big item"" that could add significantly to the federal budget deficit, he said.

Trump's proposed tariffs could raise prices for consumers and slow spending,"For retailers and consumers finally feeling some relief from inflation, President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs proposal introduces fresh uncertainty around how prices could change during his presidency, analysts said Wednesday.

Trump, who NBC News projects won a second term in a decisive victory, said during his presidential campaign that he would impose a 10% to 20% tariff on all imports, including tariffs as high as 60% to 100% for goods from China.

Companies, retail trade groups and industry analysts have warned the move could fuel higher prices on a wide range of Americans' purchases such as sneakers and party supplies.

""The adoption of across-the-board tariffs on consumer goods and other non-strategic imports amounts to a tax on American families,"" National Retail Federation CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement Wednesday. ""It will drive inflation and price increases and will result in job losses.""

Earlier this week, the NRF released a study on the impact of Trump's proposed tariff increases and said they would lead to ""dramatic"" double-digit-percentage price spikes in nearly all six retail categories that the trade group examines. Those categories are apparel, footwear, furniture, household appliances, travel goods, and toys.

The cost of clothing, for example, could rise between 12.5% and 20.6%, the analysis found.

The CEO of E.l.f. Beauty, which primarily relies on China to manufacture its beauty products, told CNBC in a Wednesday interview it could be forced to raise prices if the proposed tariff hikes take effect.

""We do have pricing power. If we saw we needed to leverage pricing, we would,"" said E.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin. ""It will depend on what we see in terms of the tariffs. It depends on the magnitude of the tariffs.""

In a research note Wednesday, GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said tariff hikes would ""create an enormous headache"" for retailers, which are likely to pass those costs on to consumers. The result is likely to be softer spending from already price-conscious shoppers.

""Despite Trump's assertions to the contrary, tariffs are paid by the companies or entities importing goods and not by the countries themselves. This means the cost of buying products from overseas, whether directly or as an input for manufacturing, would rise sharply,"" said Saunders.

""Given the trade between Chinese manufacturers and US retailers, a strict tariff policy would mean retailers initially either taking a massive hit on profits or being forced to put up prices, which would fuel inflation and dampen retail volume growth,"" he said.

Over time, supply chains would adjust to this change in tariff policy but it would be ""incredibly disruptive"" in the short term, said Saunders.

""The small hope is that the tough talk on tariffs is more of a negotiating ploy and that what is finally implemented will be relatively modest in scope,"" he said.",Nov 6 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-proposed-tariffs-consumer-prices.html

Plus, most of Trump's tax policy requires Congressional approval, which could be challenging, depending on control of the Senate and House of Representatives and support within the Republican party. While Republicans secured a Senate majority, control of the House remains uncertain. If Democrats flip the House, we could see ""more gridlock"" in Congress, which could stall Trump's agenda, Gleckman explained.

UK's ruling Labour Party rejects accusations of U.S. election interference,"British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer speaks with leaders from across the UK during the International Investment Summit on October 13, 2024 in London, England.

The U.K.'s ruling Labour Party has rejected accusations by former U.S. president Donald Trump's campaign team that the British party's members have interfered in the upcoming U.S. election.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign team on Monday accused the Labour Party of ""blatant foreign interference"" in the vote, after party volunteers travelled to several battleground states in the U.S. to help campaign for Democratic nominee and current Vice President Kamala Harris.

""It is common practice for campaigners of all political persuasions from around the world to volunteer in U.S. elections. Where Labour activists take part, they do so at their own expense, in accordance with the laws and rules,"" a Labour Party spokesperson said in emailed comments to CNBC.

The U.K.'s Prime Minister Keir Starmer also rejected accusations earlier on Wednesday during a visit to Samoa in the South Pacific.

""The Labour Party has volunteers, [they] have gone over pretty much every election,"" he said, according to the BBC.

""They're doing it in their spare time. They're doing it as volunteers. They're staying, I think, with other volunteers over there,"" he noted.

Asked if the row risked damaging his relationship with Donald Trump, the prime minister said ""no,"" pointing to a dinner the two politicians enjoyed at Trump Tower in New York last month, the British public broadcaster reported.

President Joe Biden has forgiven over $166 billion in student debt—see how much in each state,"President Joe Biden made student debt relief a focus of his administration.

The mass forgiveness he promised on the campaign trail was struck down by the Supreme Court, and some of his other debt relief initiatives, like the Saving on a Valuable Education plan and his negotiated rulemaking plan, are currently tied up in court.

But his administration has still managed to clear $166.5 billion in student loans, according to Department of Education data.

Through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, income-driven repayment — including a group of borrowers able to get forgiveness through the SAVE plan before it was blocked — total and permanent disability discharge and borrower defense to repayment discharges, about 4.4 million borrowers nationwide have had their debt waived under Biden.

Elon Musk is $70 billion richer since Trump victory due to Tesla stock surge,"Elon Musk on stage before Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York, NY on Sunday, October 27, 2024.

Elon Musk spent $44 billion to buy Twitter, now known as X, and at least $130 million to help get Donald Trump elected president.

It's a combination that's paid off handsomely. Since Trump's victory last week, Musk is about $70 billion richer on paper.

Most of Musk's wealth is wrapped up in his holdings of Tesla , and in the four trading days since the election, the electric vehicle maker's stock has soared by about 39%. That's lifted the company's market cap well past $1 trillion.

Musk's net worth has swelled to $320 billion, according to Forbes, putting him close to $90 billion ahead of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the world's second-richest person. Ellison, a close friend of Musk's and a former Tesla board member, is a longtime Republican donor who's seen his own Trump bump, with Oracle's 10% increase lifting his net worth by about $20 billion.

For Musk, getting Trump back into the White House became another full-time job. He funded a swing-state operation to register right-leaning voters, and he led rallies as a surrogate for his favored candidate. He started $1 million giveaways to registered voters who signed one of his America PAC petitions, and he faced a lawsuit over running an illegal lottery in Pennsylvania.

Musk also used X, the social media platform he acquired in 2022, to constantly tout his support for Trump while frequently spreading misinformation about his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as topics like immigration and voter fraud.

Now, Musk is trying to make sure he cashes in on his investments.

After the election last week, Musk briefly joined Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, NBC News reported. Other outlets, including The New York Times and ABC, have reported that Musk has been weighing in on staffing decisions for the next administration, and he's spent a lot of time since the election at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

How President-elect Trump can influence the U.S. economy,"When President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House in 2025, he will assume a key position within the U.S. economy.



On the campaign trail, the former President promised to eliminate regulations that hold back key U.S. industries and extend tax cuts that expire after 2025. He also proposed raising tariffs that affect prices of foreign goods imported to the U.S.



""Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've done for the world,"" the former President said at the September presidential debate.

The goal of the tariffs is to generate revenue and bring industrial jobs back to the country. The side effect could be higher retail prices for many U.S. consumers.



""Ironically, this would not promote a revitalization of the industrial sector,"" said Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.



The President-elect has also promised to embark on a large deportation operation when he enters office.



Analysts believe Trump's fiscal ideas could influence the trajectory of employment, inflation, and more in the U.S. -- particularly if the Republican party wins both chambers of Congress.

"Trump targets Washington Post, CBS with long-shot legal actions over Harris coverage, ads","The Washington Post office in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, June 27, 2024.

Days before the presidential election, former President Donald Trump and his campaign have launched legal actions against two major media outlets, claiming that they are illegally helping Vice President Kamala Harris through their news coverage and advertising.

Legal experts said Trump's efforts are frivolous.

The Republican's campaign on Thursday filed a Federal Election Commission complaint accusing The Washington Post of making ""Illegal Corporate In-Kind Contributions"" to Harris.

The campaign based its accusation on a Semafor report which said that the Post, as part of a ramped-up paid advertising campaign on social media, highlighted numerous articles critical of Trump versus more neutral coverage of the Democratic nominee.

The FEC complaint alleges that Semafor's report indicates that the Post ""is conducting a dark money corporate campaign in opposition to President Donald J. Trump.""

That claim is ""completely preposterous,"" Columbia Law School Professor Richard Briffault told CNBC.

""There is no evidence in the allegations of any coordination between the Post and the Harris campaign,"" said Briffault, who specializes in campaign finance regulation and political law.

The Post's ads ""at most"" constitute independent expenditures protected by the Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC, which broadened the rules on corporate election spending, he said.

""And as the Trump letter acknowledges there is no express advocacy of Harris so the Post's actions don't count as independent expenditures,"" Briffault added.

""This is litigation by press release and not more serious than that.""

A spokesperson for the newspaper told CNBC in a statement Friday, ""As part of The Washington Post's regular social media marketing strategy, promoted posts across social media platforms reflect high-performing content across all verticals and subjects.""

""We believe allegations suggesting this routine media practice is improper are without merit,"" the spokesperson said.

Also on Thursday, Trump filed a federal civil lawsuit against CBS Broadcasting, seeking $10 billion in damages over the network's editing of a ""60 Minutes"" interview with Harris that aired in early October.

The 19-page suit, which accuses CBS of unlawfully interfering in the election to help get Harris elected, is solely based on the network airing two different portions of Harris' answer to the same question.

In an excerpt of the interview that aired on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Harris is shown delivering one part of the answer.

But ""60 Minutes"" showed a different portion of Harris' response.

Trump has repeatedly claimed on social media and at campaign rallies that the editorial move constitutes the ""biggest media scandal in broadcast history.""

He has demanded that CBS lose its broadcast license, which is issued by the federal government.

""60 Minutes"" on Oct. 20 slammed Trump for accusing the program of deceitful editing, calling his claim ""false.""",Nov 1 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/trump-media-legal-action-fec-harris-election.html
"Trump plan to 'end all taxes' on overtime pay would benefit millions of Americans, but it's going to be uphill battle","Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. October 15, 2024.

The millions of Americans who work overtime have a little more reason to hope for tax relief.

Republicans this week eked out a slim majority in the House, winning 218 seats, with a few races still uncalled. This means a Republican trifecta and more chance of passing proposals floated by President-elect Trump on the campaign trail, including one that would scrap taxes on overtime.

Details on the proposal are scant and some Democrats have called the overtime tax promise ""as fake as his tan."" It may not be the top priority of the new administration when it comes to tax cuts, or the easiest to pass, but the overtime proposal is likely to be part of broader discussions on tax reform.

""The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,"" Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition team, wrote in an email.

Here's what workers need to know about the overtime proposal and what it could mean for their pocketbooks:

A bill already introduced in Congress, and some state action

Trump unveiled his tax-free overtime proposal on the campaign trail in September but didn't offer details. ""As part of our additional tax cuts, we will end all taxes on overtime,"" he said at a rally in Tucson, Arizona. ""If you're an overtime worker, when you're past 40 hours a week, your overtime hours will be tax-free,"" Trump said.

There's already a bill in Congress that was introduced in July by Congressman Russ Fulcher, a Republican from Idaho. The Keep Every Extra Penny (KEEP) Act has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means and also doesn't have a lot of details beyond saying: ''Gross income shall not include overtime compensation required under section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards 9 Act of 1938.'' There hasn't been any further action on this bill since July.

There have been mixed results at the state level to exempt overtime pay from income tax. Alabama passed a bill in 2023 that temporarily exempts overtime pay from state income tax. It's in effect for tax years that begin after December 31, 2023, and end prior to January 1, 2027. A similar effort proposed in Wisconsin stalled earlier this year.

Hourly workers would receive most of the benefit

Millions of American workers currently work overtime and could be impacted by a change in policy on how these earnings are taxed. This could translate into savings of a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars for higher earners who put in a lot of overtime, tax policy professionals said.

""It could be a fairly expansive policy in terms of who it could reach,"" said Joseph Rosenberg, senior fellow at The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. But it would also be very costly in terms of reducing revenue for the federal government, he added.

Department of Labor data show that there were 97.7 million employed workers last year who were eligible for FLSA-overtime protections. That represented 60% of household employment in 2023 and about two-thirds of wage and salary employment, according to a report from The Budget Lab at Yale, citing DOL data. Among these, 82.1 million were hourly workers and 15.6 million were salaried workers, the report said.



It's important to note, however, that being eligible under FLSA doesn't necessarily equate to actually working overtime. The Budget Lab noted that 7 million Americans regularly worked overtime last year; 6.4 million of these workers were hourly workers; while 600,00 were salaried. That translates to about 8% of hourly workers in the U.S. and about 4% of salaried employees who work FLSA-qualified overtime on a regular basis, according to John Ricco, associate director of policy analysis at The Budget Lab. Meanwhile, about 7% of hourly workers and 70% of salaried workers do not qualify for FLSA, the report said.

What's more, on Friday, a U.S. District Court in Texas overturned a Department of Labor rule that had expanded the salary cap for workers eligible for overtime pay starting in July, after a legal challenge brought by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and supported by many industries. The court had already blocked the rule in Texas and Friday's decision now vacates the DOL rule nationwide, which would have cover as many as four million more workers. Congress is not bound by DOL rules in how it defines provisions in tax legislation.

While it could be a big tax benefit for some workers, it still wouldn't impact the vast majority of U.S. workers, given that the U.S. population is more than 300 million and the workforce is more than 168 million people. ""This is not likely to be a huge share of the workforce who would be impacted, depending on how tightly Congress defines overtime pay,"" said Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a research think tank.

Cost to government could reach $3 trillion over decade

The Tax Foundation estimates it could cost the federal government between $225 billion to slightly over $3 trillion over 10 years, depending largely on how Congress designs the law, Muresianu said.

For example, would it be designed as just an income tax or would it be a payroll tax exemption as well? ""A payroll tax exemption would reach lower down in the income distribution, but that has additional implications for the financing of Social Security and Medicare, as well as impacts on future benefits which are tied to the taxes that people pay on their income,"" Rosenberg said.

The hefty federal deficit could be a stumbling block to passing any number of Trump's various tax proposals beyond extending the 2017 cuts. Extending the Trump tax cuts for the next 10 years — as Republicans have proposed — would add $4.6 trillion to the deficit, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Including all of the new tax cuts proposed could bring the total price tag to roughly $10 trillion over a decade, according to multiple estimates.

It's possible Republicans will be more willing to act on these costly initiatives, hoping to make up for some of the cost with revenue generated by new tariffs on imports, estimated at up to $3 trillion in new government revenue.",Nov 15 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/president-trump-income-tax-cuts-overtime-pay-congress.html

Including Larsen's August contribution of $1 million worth of XRP tokens, the billionaire has given more than $11.8 million to PACs supporting the Harris campaign, making him one of the crypto industry's largest individual donors this cycle.

Larsen, who's backed candidates across the aisle the last few years, told CNBC in an interview that his comfort level with Harris comes from conversations he's had with people inside the campaign and what he's seen from the vice president since she replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket in July.

It helps that Harris is from the Bay Area.

""So I think she gets it at a fundamental level, in a way that I think the Biden folks were just not paying attention to, or maybe just didn't make the connection between empowering workers and making sure you have American champions dominating their industries.""

Trump vows to deport millions. Builders say it would drain their crews and drive up home costs,"Construction of a KB Home single-family housing development is shown in Menifee, California, on Sept. 4, 2024. Mike Blake | Reuters

Both presidential candidates promise to build more homes. One promises to deport hundreds of thousands of people who build them. Former President Donald Trump's pledge to ""launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country"" would hamstring construction firms already facing labor shortages and push record home prices higher, say industry leaders, contractors and economists. ""It would be detrimental to the construction industry and our labor supply and exacerbate our housing affordability problems,"" said Jim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders. The trade group considers foreign-born workers, regardless of legal status, ""a vital and flexible source of labor"" to builders, estimating they fill 30% of trade jobs like carpentry, plastering, masonry and electrical roles.

Either I make half as much money or I up my prices. And who ultimately pays for that? The homeowner. Brent Taylor President of Taylor Construction Group, Tampa, Fla.

Nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants were living in the U.S. as of 2022, the latest federal data shows, down from an 11.8 million peak in 2007. The construction sector employs an estimated 1.5 million undocumented workers, or 13% of its total workforce — a larger share than any other, according to data the Pew Research Center provided to NBC News. Industry experts say their rates are higher in Sun Belt states like Florida and Texas, and more pronounced in residential than in commercial construction. For Brent Taylor, home building has been ""a very, very difficult industry the past few years, and it seems to only be getting worse."" His five-person, Tampa-based business hires subcontractors to perform all the labor, and if those firms' employees ""show up on my jobsite because they work for that company, I don't know if they're legal or not,"" he said. The labor pool is tight already, with the U.S. construction industry still looking to fill 370,000 open positions, according to federal data. If work crews dwindle further, ""now I can only do 10 jobs a year instead of 20,"" Taylor said. ""Either I make half as much money or I up my prices. And who ultimately pays for that? The homeowner.""

Rhetoric or reality?

You’d lose so many people that you couldn’t put a crew together to frame a house. Stan Marek CEO of the Marek Family of Companies

We have to have a serious conversation in this country about immigration policy and reform, and we can no longer delay it. Jim Tobin CEO of the National Association of Home Builders

""The rhetoric on immigration, it's at 11,"" Tobin said. ""We have to have a serious conversation in this country about immigration policy and reform, and we can no longer delay it."" Marek, who has long advocated for more ways for undocumented people to work legally in construction, said reforms are decades overdue. As an employer, ""I do everything I can to make sure everybody's legal,"" he said, even as the industry's hunger for low-cost labor has created a shadow economy that he says often exploits the undocumented workers it depends upon. ""We need them. They're building our houses — have been for 30 years,"" he said. ""Losing the workers would devastate our companies, our industry and our economy.""

'The math is just not there'

There is evidence that foreign-born construction workers help keep the housing market in check. An analysis released in December 2022 by the George W. Bush Institute and Southern Methodist University found U.S. metro areas with the fastest-growing immigrant populations had the lowest building costs. ""Immigrant construction workers in Sun Belt metros like Raleigh, Nashville, Houston, and San Antonio have helped these cities sustain their housing cost advantage over coastal cities despite rapid growth in housing demand,"" the authors wrote. But builders need many more workers as it is. ""The math is just not there"" to sustain a blow from mass deportations, said Ron Hetrick, a senior labor economist at the workforce analytics firm Lightcast. ""That would be incredibly disruptive"" and cause ""a very, very significant hit on home construction,"" he said. Private employers in the field have been adding jobs for the past decade, with employment levels now topping 8 million, over 1 million more since the pandemic, according to payroll processor ADP. But as Hetrick noted, ""the average high school student is not aspiring to do this work,"" and the existing workforce is aging — the average homebuilder is 57 years old. Undocumented workers would likely flee ahead of any national deportation effort, Hetrick said, even though many have been in the U.S. for well over a decade. He expects such a policy would trigger an exodus of people with legal authorization, too.

""I also want to speak to the comments that have been recently made by the speaker of the House,"" Harris said in Milwaukee to a group of reporters. ""It is just further evidence of everything that I've actually been talking about for months now, about [former President Donald] Trump's intention to implement Project 2025.""

""We've talked repeatedly about their intention to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Now to get rid of the CHIPS Act,"" she added.

Speaker Johnson, R-La., made the comment at a Friday campaign event in New York for House Rep. Brandon Williams, R-N.Y., a vulnerable GOP candidate in one of the most closely watched House races of this election cycle.

""I expect that we probably will, but we haven't developed that part of the agenda yet,"" Johnson said in response to a reporter asking whether the GOP would try to repeal the law.

The CHIPS Act passed Congress with bipartisan support in 2022. The law has unlocked nearly $53 billion of funding to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors, which are crucial for the growth of strategic industries such as artificial intelligence. The federal government has announced more than $30 billion of investments under the law as of August.

Harris has turned manufacturing investment into one of the central planks of her economic platform.

""It is my plan and intention to continue to invest in American manufacturing, the work being done by American workers upholding and lifting up good union jobs,"" Harris said in Milwaukee. ""That is the way we are going to win the competition with China for the 21st century.""",Nov 2 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/02/harris-critcizes-speaker-johnson-republicans-repeal-chips-act.html
Trump doubles down on tariff plan that voters hate,"Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign town hall meeting in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, U.S. October 20, 2024.

A majority of voters are less likely to support a candidate who promotes universal tariffs, according to NBC News polling released Sunday, marring a cornerstone economic proposal of former President Donald Trump's campaign.

The poll found that 44% of respondents said they would be less inclined to vote for a candidate supporting a tariff as high as 20% on imports across the board. Meanwhile, 35% said they would be more likely to support someone with that tariff proposal, while 19% said it made no difference.

The poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from Oct. 4 to Oct. 8 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Despite the unpopularity of universal tariffs among voters, Trump has dug in on the hardline proposal.

""The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States, so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,"" Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg Editor in Chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago last Tuesday.",Oct 20 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/20/trump-tariffs-election.html

LONDON — President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs could prove a boon for the U.K., with analysts pointing to potential exemptions, economic upswings and the likely resumption of trade deal talks. Britain may be hoping that its ""special relationship"" across the Atlantic — as well as Trump's affinity for Brexit — are enough to spare it from the most punitive of proposed trade levies. But analysts suggest the incoming president's main motivation is likely to be purely economic. ""The U.K.'s benefit is it's not in the trade war crosshairs. It just doesn't have that same need to level the playing field and level the trade imbalance,"" Jonathan Pingle, chief U.S. economist at UBS, told CNBC Tuesday. Trump has long argued that global trade imbalances disadvantage the U.S. economy, with domestic production in particular being undercut by foreign goods. As such, in his 2024 campaign, he vowed to impose 10% to 20% tariffs on all foreign imports — a rate he said would rise to 60% to 100% for Chinese goods. The U.S. is the U.K.'s largest trading partner, with trade between the two countries totaling £304.3 billion ($388 billion) in the four quarters to the end of the second quarter of 2024. As such, tariffs could serve a severe blow to the British economy. Unlike China and the EU, however — with whom the U.S. runs a large trade deficit — the U.K.'s trade balance is far tighter, and largely centered on the services sector, which is less likely to provoke tough measures from a protectionist Trump administration, analysts say.

I suspect there is some ground for the U.K. to agree some kind of concession [or] carve-out ... That might mean any tariffs are watered down. Paul Dales chief U.K. economist at Capital Economics

""Trump is also unlikely to think that the U.K. is taking advantage of the U.S. like he thinks China and to a lesser extent the EU is,"" Andrew Wishart, senior U.K. economist at Berenberg said in emailed comments Monday. In fact, the U.K. could actually expect to see lesser levies, or indeed immunity, from the plans, according to Capital Economics' chief U.K. economist, Paul Dales. ""I suspect there is some ground for the U.K. to agree some kind of concession [or] carve-out, should the U.S. place tariffs on imports from the U.K.,"" Dales, told CNBC via email Monday. ""That might mean that any tariffs are watered down or cancelled after a while."" While economists have warned that Trump's proposed tariffs would be broadly inflationary for the global economy, Capital Economics forecast in a pre-election note that the impact of tariffs would be either small — or perhaps even positive — for the U.K. economy, as a result of currency fluctuations and potential allowances.

Striking a U.S.-U.K. free-trade deal

That potential for special U.K. allowances has once again raised the specter of a possible bilateral trade deal between the two nations. A U.K.-U.S. free trade deal was touted as one of the key benefits of Brexit, with ""Leave"" campaigners suggesting such a deal could be secured in short order following Britain's departure from the EU. But progress has since been slow. When contacted by CNBC, the Trump campaign did not directly comment on the possibility of special trade allowances for the U.K., nor a wider trade deal. However, a transition spokeswoman said Trump's election win had given him a ""mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail.""

The U.K. government, meanwhile, said that it was looking ""forward to working closely with President Trump to improve UK-US trading relations to support businesses on both sides of the Atlantic."" It follows reports over the weekend that Trump could be willing to strike a deal with Britain due, in part, to the president-elect's support for Brexit. Former political appointee Peggy Grande told the Independent newspaper on Sunday that trade tariffs were likely to hit the EU more than Britain because Trump wanted to see a ""successful Brexit."" Meanwhile, Democratic Governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, told the Telegraph that Trump may treat the U.K. more favorably because he has an ""sympathy for somebody who leaves a bureaucracy.""

I don't think Trump cares about the U.K. exercising its Brexit freedoms ... it's an attempt to divide and conquer Europe. Mujtaba Rahman Eurasia Group's managing director

Others were less sanguine about Trump's support for U.K. sovereignty, however, suggesting instead that the former president's key motivation may be to assert control over the continent. ""I don't think Trump cares about the U.K. exercising its Brexit freedoms, but I do think it's an attempt to divide and conquer Europe,"" Mujtaba Rahman, Eurasia Group's managing director for Europe, told CNBC by phone.

"Trump Media loses $19.2 million in third quarter, surprise Election Day filing reveals","Trump Media , which experienced a flurry of trading activity Tuesday as a possible proxy for Donald Trump's presidency chances, revealed after the closing bell Tuesday a loss for the third quarter along with a slight drop in already-meager revenue.

The Truth Social parent lost $19.2 million during the period. Revenue fell 5.6% to just $1.01 million from the year-earlier period. The filing was not telegraphed to investors beforehand and came as a surprise to traders not expecting it on Election Day, the very day the former president and Trump Media majority owner squares off against Vice President Kamala Harris.

Shares rose more than 6% in after-hours trading following the filing. Earlier in the day, the stock gave up an 18.6% surge to close 1.2% lower. The shares could move in the after hours or on Wednesday depending on the election results.

Trump Media, which trades under the ticker DJT, has seen volatile trading lately. Over the past week, it is down more than 34%. However, it is still up 93% year to date.

Volume for the stock more than doubled its average 30-day volume.

Trump Media also reported about $2.6 million in revenue and a net loss of $363 million for the first nine months of 2024. On top of that, the company boasted that it ended the third quarter with $673 million in cash and investments, along with no debt.

""This has been an extraordinary quarter for the Company,"" CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement. Trump Media is continuing to ""explore additional possibilities for growth.""

The stock dropped more than 20%, following a 5.9% pop on Wednesday after the Republican was elected the 47th president of the United States and is set to return to the White House for another four years.

Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group , President-elect Donald Trump's media company, plunged on Thursday, giving back the rally in the previous session triggered by his election victory.

Trump Media, which is the operator of Truth Social, was viewed as a proxy for Trump's election odds in the past few months. The stock had shot up as much as 60% early Wednesday as Trump was projected to defeat Vice President Kamala Harris. It later pared gains in the regular trading session.

The media company, majority owned by Trump, went public in March via a blank-check merger and now trades under ticker DJT — Trump's initials.

Trading in the name has been particularly volatile since its market debut. Investors have largely turned a blind eye to the company's fundamentals. Trump Media released a surprise earnings statement after the bell Tuesday that showed the company lost $19.2 million in the third quarter.

"Trump victory drives gold to near 2-month lows as investors pile into equities, cryptocurrencies","Gold inched lower on Thursday, pressured by a stronger U.S. dollar and rising Treasury yields, while investors awaited a key inflation report to assess the Federal Reserve's policy path.

Gold prices extended their decline to a near two-month low Thursday amid risk-on sentiment and as the dollar continues to strengthen following Donald Trump's election victory last week.

Spot prices of the yellow metal have dropped nearly 7% since the election results last week to $2,559.2 per ounce. Gold futures on the New York Mercantile exchange were trading at $2,567.3.

The recent slide — gold has declined in six of the seven sessions since Trump's victory — follows a series of record-breaking milestones for bullion over the past year.

""There's a pause in the bull market in gold and silver, and that may continue for the next couple of weeks or so,"" said Citi's global head of commodities research Maximilian Layton.

He elaborated that gold prices are likely to trade lower as U.S. equities rally on prospects of lower tax and regulations. Trump's return to the White House had sent U.S. stocks to record highs though the rally has taken a breather.

The postelection risk-on sentiment has also lifted cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin briefly trading above $93,000 for the first time on Wednesday on hopes that Trump will make good on a slew of promises to the industry.

""Trump looking like he's going to have a red sweep and higher deregulation, lower tax environment has led money into equities, money into bitcoin, and money out of gold,"" Layton told CNBC.

The dollar index has also climbed to a one-year high, making greenback-priced gold expensive for holders of other currencies.

""The rise in the U.S. dollar reflects how markets have priced in Trump's inflationary policy agenda, which primarily includes tax cuts and tariffs,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Vivek Dhar wrote in a note dated Wednesday.

Equities are in ""euphoria territory"" right now as they price in market-friendly outcomes of the elections, said Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at treading services firm MKS Pamp. ""Until this Trump trade honeymoon phase runs its course, gold and silver are amidst repricing to a less bullish trajectory,"" she said.

In spite of the slide in gold prices, market watchers are still optimistic on the fundamentals of the bullion.

The underlying drivers of the gold market are still in place, Layton said. After Trump's election victory, there has been increasing speculation about his tariff proposals and their potential impact on the global economy.

""As that happens, people will be buying gold and silver to hedge those downside risks,"" said Layton.

Additionally, central bank demand for gold is expected to remain strong, if not grow, due to the U.S. fiscal outlook and increasing geopolitical tensions, according to financial services firm Canaccord Genuity. Central banks purchased record amount of gold in the first half of 2024.

""If President-elect Trump's second term is anything like his first, with a confrontational approach to friends and foes alike, we believe strong international demand for gold as a reserve asset is likely to continue relative to demand for treasuries,"" the bank's analysts wrote in a report.

A mix of rising debt, geopolitical tensions and central bank demand are expected to support higher gold prices, said Canaccord Genuity.",Nov 14 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/14/trump-victory-drives-gold-to-near-2-month-lows-as-investors-pile-into-equities-cryptocurrencies.html
"Trump promised no taxes on Social Security benefits. It's too soon to plan on that change, experts say","Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump arrives to speak at his rally during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, in Palm Beach County Convention Center, in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., November 6, 2024.

On the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a notable promise to retirees: No taxes on Social Security benefits.

Now that Trump has won a second presidential term, that may prompt Social Security's beneficiaries to wonder whether that change may come to pass.

But nixing those taxes may be a difficult task, even if Trump has a Republican majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Any changes to Social Security would require at least 60 Senate votes, and Republicans would therefore need some Democratic support to pass those changes.

Just eliminating taxes on benefits, without any other changes to make up for that loss in revenues, would worsen the program's current funding woes, experts say.

""It's hard for me to imagine that Democrats would be willing to provide votes to get over that 60-vote threshold and weaken Social Security solvency,"" said Charles Blahous, senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, who has also served as a public trustee for Social Security and Medicare.

""I think a lot of Republicans would have heartburn about it, too,"" he said.

Ending taxes on Social Security benefits — along with other Trump proposals to end taxes on tips and overtime, impose tariffs and deport immigrants — would ""dramatically worsen"" Social Security's finances, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found in a recent report.

The Trump campaign has pushed back on those findings, calling the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ""consistently wrong"" in a statement to CNBC when the report was released.

The campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, about where the proposal stands on Trump's priority list following his inauguration.

The Social Security trust fund used to help pay retirement benefits is projected to run out in 2033, according to the program's actuaries. At that time, beneficiaries could see across-the-board benefit cuts, though the president may have the ability to determine how those reductions are distributed among beneficiaries, according to recent research.",Nov 6 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-promised-no-taxes-on-social-security-benefits-here-what-experts-say.html
Trump calls for investigation of 'rumors' he plans to sell Trump Media stock,"This illustration shows an image of President-elect Donald Trump next to a phone screen that is displaying the Truth Social app, in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 21, 2022.

Trump Media shares soared Friday after President-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed he has no plans to sell off his stake in the Truth Social operator, and called on authorities to investigate whoever suggested otherwise.

Trump's announcement, posted on Truth Social, was his first personally written statement since his stunning victory against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in Tuesday's presidential election.

DJT shares shot up more than 10% immediately following Trump's post, triggering a temporary trading halt due to volatility.

""There are fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth,"" the Republican said in the post Friday morning.

""THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING!"" Trump said. ""I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities.""

Trump is the majority owner of Trump Media. His stake as of Friday was worth more than $3 billion.

The company on Election Day posted a net loss of $19 million in the last quarter on revenue of just more than $1 million. But its stock nevertheless closed higher Wednesday, as Trump's political triumph buoyed his fans who have bought into the company as a way to support him.

#EndtheFed': Elon Musk endorses plan to let presidents meddle with Federal Reserve after Trump election win,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk (R) joins former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the site of his first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 5, 2024.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the billionaire backer of newly minted President-elect Donald Trump, endorsed the idea of allowing presidents to intervene on Federal Reserve policy.

In response to a Thursday social media post from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, which called for the Fed to be under the direction of the president, Musk on Friday posted the ""100"" emoji used to convey agreement.

Sen. Lee had punctuated his post with ""#EndtheFed.""

Though brief, Musk's comment reflects a broader pressure campaign on Fed independence that could take shape in the next Trump administration.

On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he would not resign from his post if Trump asked him to do so. That marked the revival of what could again evolve into a contentious relationship between the Fed chair and the president-elect.

The tradition of Fed independence aims to give the central bank the ability to shape monetary policy decisions — such as raising or lowering interest rates — based solely on the future health of the U.S. economy.

But during his first term in office, Trump was not shy about breaking from tradition and publicly disparaging Powell and his policy decisions.

Over the course of the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump also often flirted with the idea of giving himself a say in Fed policy if he were to win the White House again.

""I feel the president should have at least [a] say in there,"" Trump said in August at a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. ""I think that in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.""",Nov 9 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/09/elon-musk-endorses-trump-intervene-federal-reserve.html
"Trump Media closes up 8% after rollercoaster trading session with heavy volume, several halts","Shares of Trump Media rose more than 8% Tuesday after whipsawing in the company's heaviest and most volatile trading day since going public.

The company majority owned by Donald Trump, which trades as DJT on the Nasdaq, experienced five separate halts within the first two hours of frenzied, high-volume trading.

The first five-minute halt occurred at 9:36 a.m. ET, when shares were trading up around 14%.

Dogecoin and other memecoins surge as Trump wins presidential election,"In this photo illustration, the Elon Musk's twitter account seen displayed on a mobile phone screen with a Dogecoin logo in the background.

Memecoins surged Wednesday as former President Donald Trump clinched a second term in office.

Dogecoin surged more than 15% and Shiba Inu gained 6%, according to Coin Metrics. The moves came as bitcoin rose to a fresh record above $76,000.

NBC News projects that Trump will defeat his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, after winning 276 Electoral College Votes, including some key swing states.

""With the crypto markets experiencing low volatility in the lead up to the election as the industry looks to gain clarity on future regulatory conditions, traders are bracing for volatility once results start to come out,"" said Chris Chung, CEO at Titan, a decentralized exchange aggregator built on the Solana blockchain. ""Certain sectors that have buoyed prices, such as the renewed interest in memecoins, may experience major price movements as individual states report election results.""

In the lead-up to Election Day, memecoins and AI-related crypto tokens outperformed the overall crypto market. The sector of the crypto market is used as a measure of retail investors' risk appetite.

A ramp-up of memecoin activity is a sign that retail investors are participating and have appetite to speculate much further down the risk curve, Ryan Rasmussen, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, told CNBC.

""Given that memecoins have low market caps and liquidity, I'm not surprised to see them skyrocketing alongside the broader crypto rally,"" he said. ""If crypto sells off, I'd expect the same outsized move in memecoins to the downside.""

""I'd urge long-term investors to not place too much emphasis on memecoin activity,"" he said. ""In the long term, there will be very few winners in the memecoin market, and with thousands of coins launching daily, picking a specific memecoin is akin to buying a lotto ticket.""

The president-elect is seen as the more favorable candidate for the broader crypto market beyond bitcoin as he has promised a more cypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission if elected for another term.

""Trump has largely been seen as extremely positive for the cryptocurrency markets, and any indication of a possible victory will likely push prices up extremely quickly in anticipation of a flood of capital being deployed,"" Chung said.

""Dogecoin specifically could also be rallying on ""the very real prospects that Elon Musk [a long-time Dogecoin proponent] could be appointed to head the Department of Government Efficiency in a Trump admin,"" said Nic Puckrin, co-founder and CEO at crypto education platform Coin Bureau.

Trump says Musk and Ramaswamy will lead government efficiency group,"President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that Elon Musk and former Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy will lead an efficiency group when his second term begins in January.

Trump wrote in a post that the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, will ""become, potentially, 'The Manhattan Project' of our time."" He also said the group would, ""pave the way"" for his next administration to ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.""

Trump didn't specify where cuts will take place or when the department may be formed. Congress hasn't created or funded such an office. He said the group's ""work will conclude no later than July 4, 2026.""

Musk's involvement in the envisioned group was previously promised by Trump and touted by the Tesla CEO, who spent an estimated $200 million backing the Republican nominee's 2024 campaign, as a reason to put the former president back in the White House. Musk, who also runs defense contractor SpaceX, has reportedly been stationed at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida since election night.

Ramaswamy, who challenged Trump in the Republican primary, is co-founder of investment firm Strive Asset Management. He has opposed the widespread adoption of environmental, social and governance, or ESG, principles by companies.

How Trump's victory could change abortion rights in America,"Anti-abortion demonstrators listen to President Donald Trump as he speaks at the 47th annual ""March for Life"" in Washington, D.C., Jan. 24, 2020.

Voters in seven out of 10 states approved ballot measures this week to safeguard abortion rights, a hot-button issue that helped drive Americans to the polls.

But President-elect Donald Trump's victory early Wednesday could make access to the procedure more vulnerable and uncertain across the U.S., health policy experts warned, leaving the reproductive well-being of many women hanging in the balance.

Trump has waffled considerably on his position on abortion, most recently saying he would not support a federal ban and wants to leave the issue up to the states. But Trump and his appointees to federal agencies could further restrict abortion on the federal level through methods that won't require Congress to pass new legislation.

""The more restrictions we see on abortion over the next four years, the worse health outcomes are going to be. People are suffering and dying unnecessarily,"" said Katie O'Connor, senior director of federal abortion policy at the National Women's Law Center.

Abortion access in the U.S. has already been in a state of flux in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the federal constitutional right to the procedure — a decision Trump takes credit for since he reshaped the court. As of last year, more than 25 million women ages 15 to 44 lived in states where there are more restrictions on abortion than before the court's ruling in 2022, PBS reported.

Experts say a further crackdown on abortion by the Trump administration could put the health of many patients, especially those who are lower-income or people of color, at risk.

""As long as we have a government that is not fully committed to abortion access for everyone who seeks it, there is going to be chaos and confusion on the ground around what is legal and what is available,"" O'Connor said. ""It's going to contribute to the ongoing health-care access crisis we're seeing with abortion.""'

It's unclear what Trump's actions around the issue could look like. There is little public support for Congress to pass nationwide bans on abortion, according to a poll conducted in June by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. At least 70% of Americans oppose a federal ban on abortion or a ban on the procedure at six weeks.

If Trump does decide to curb access, experts say, that could include limiting the use of medication abortion, particularly when it is administered through telehealth or delivered by mail.

Medication is the most common method used to end a pregnancy in the U.S., accounting for 63% of all abortions in the U.S. last year, according to a March study by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access.

In a statement, Trump's campaign said he ""has long been consistent in supporting the rights of states to make decisions on abortion.""",Nov 7 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/how-trumps-victory-could-change-abortion-rights-in-america.html
"An AI-powered bot army on X spread pro-Trump and pro-GOP propaganda, research shows","Kirill Kudryavtsev | AFP | Getty Images

An army of political propaganda accounts powered by artificial intelligence posed as real people on X to argue in favor of Republican candidates and causes, according to a research report out of Clemson University. The report details a coordinated AI campaign using large language models (LLM) — the type of artificial intelligence that powers convincing, human-seeming chat bots like ChatGPT — to reply to other users. While it's unclear who operated or funded the network, its focus on particular political pet projects with no clear connection to foreign countries indicates it's an American political operation, rather than one run by a foreign government, the researchers said.

The presence of a seemingly coordinated domestic influence operation using AI adds yet another wrinkle to a rapidly developing and chaotic information landscape. The network identified by the Clemson researchers included at least 686 identified X accounts that have posted more than 130,000 times since January. It targeted four Senate races and two primary races and supported former President Donald Trump's re-election campaign. Many of the accounts were removed from X after NBC News emailed the platform for comment. The platform did not respond to NBC News' inquiry. The accounts followed a consistent pattern. Many had profile pictures that appealed to conservatives, like the far-right cartoon meme Pepe the frog, a cross or an American flag. They frequently replied to a person talking about a politician or a polarizing political issue on X, often to support Republican candidates or policies or denigrate Democratic candidates. While the accounts generally had few followers, their practice of replying to more popular posters made it more likely they'd be seen.

Fake accounts and bots designed to artificially boost other accounts have plagued social media platforms for years. But it's only with the advent of widely available large language models in late 2022 that it has been possible to automate convincing, interactive human conversations at scale. ""I am concerned about what this campaign shows is possible,"" Darren Linvill, the co-director of Clemson's Media Hub and the lead researcher on the study, told NBC News. ""Bad actors are just learning how to do this now. They're definitely going to get better at it."" The accounts took distinct positions on certain races. In the Ohio Republican Senate primary, they supported Frank LaRose over Trump-backed Bernie Moreno. In Arizona's Republican congressional primary, the accounts supported Blake Masters over Abraham Hamadeh. Both Masters and Hamadeh were supported by Trump over four other GOP candidates. The network also supported the Republican nominee in Senate races in Montana, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as North Carolina's Republican-led voter identification law. A spokesperson for Hamadeh, who won the primary in July, told NBC News that the campaign noticed an influx of messages criticizing Hamadeh whenever he posted on X, but didn't know who to report the phenomenon to or how to stop them. X offers users an option to report misuse of the platform, like spam, but its policies don't explicitly prohibit AI-driven fake accounts. The researchers determined that the accounts were in the same network by assessing metadata and tracking the contents of their replies and the accounts that they replied to — sometimes the accounts repeatedly attacked the same targets together. Clemson researchers identified many accounts in the network via text in their posts that indicated that they had ""broken,"" where their text included reference to being written by AI. Initially, the bots appeared to use ChatGPT, one of the most tightly controlled LLMs. In a post tagging Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, one of the accounts wrote: ""Hey there, I'm an AI language model trained by OpenAI. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"" OpenAI declined to comment. In June, the network reflected that it was using Dolphin, a smaller model designed to circumvent restrictions like those on ChatGPT, which prohibits using its product to mislead others. In some tweets from the accounts, text would be included with phrases like ""Dolphin here!"" and ""Dolphin, the uncensored AI tweet writer."" Kai-Cheng Yang, a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University who studies misuse of generative AI but was not involved with Clemson's research, reviewed the findings at NBC News' request. In an interview, he supported the findings and methodology, noting that the accounts often included a rare tell: Unlike real people, they often made up hashtags to go with their posts.

 Independent review finds systemic Secret Service failures enabled first Trump assassination attempt,"Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump is assisted by guards during a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show in Butler, Pennsylvania, U.S., July 13, 2024. Brendan Mcdermid | Reuters

An independent, bipartisan review identified ""numerous mistakes"" by the Secret Service and ""specific failures and breakdowns"" that enabled the assassination attempt that injured former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pa., in July. The panel, made up of four former senior law enforcement and government officials, also warned of another catastrophic security lapse if the Secret Service does not immediately undertake ""fundamental reform."" ""The Secret Service has become bureaucratic, complacent, and static,"" the panel wrote in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who oversees the organization. ""The Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission,"" they added. ""Without that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again."" The Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the review. A spokesperson previously told NBC News that the agency had ""developed a plan for an agency-wide paradigm shift"" to address known issues around staffing, training, and use of technology.

Biden heading to Berlin for talks on defense, trade and Ukraine ""The increasing demand placed on the agency during this dynamic threat environment has resulted in our people being pushed to the limit,"" said Anthony Guglielmi, the chief of communications for the Secret Service. ""We recognize that this is not sustainable, and we cannot risk another mission failure."" The panel conducted 58 multi-hour interviews of individuals from the Secret Service, federal, state, and local law enforcement and reviewed over 7,000 documents, according to its report. The panel members and staff also traveled to Butler where they surveyed the site of the attempted assassination. The group said they identified ""deep flaws in the Secret Service, including some that appear to be systemic or cultural"" including a ""lack of critical thinking among Secret Service personnel"" and agents' unwillingness to ""speak up"" regarding potential threats.

Long list of failures

The new report reflects much of what was previously reported about the Secret Service's failures before and during the July 13 rally. No personnel from the Secret Service or any other federal state or local law enforcement agency, for example, were specifically tasked with securing the roof of the building that the gunman fired at Trump from. Mitigating the line of sight from the building to the stage with physical barriers if needed should have been a standard operating procedure for the Secret Service and ""represents a critical security failure,"" the review said. Trump's Secret Service detail did additional advance work prior to the rally, including a counter-sniper advance, specifically because the leader and assistant leader of Trump's personal detail had been read in on intelligence ""related to a long-range threat against former President Trump by a foreign actor, though not specific to the Butler rally. The Trump campaign later said that Trump had been briefed by US intelligence officials on ""real and specific threats"" from Iran to assassinate him. ""Ironically, Crooks' method of attempted assassination embodied the very sort of threat which the intelligence warned against"" the report concluded. In a footnote, the report notes that ""the panel has encountered some evidence that Trump Campaign staff expressed resistance regarding the placement of certain heavy equipment and/or vehicles at the site,"" which could have been used to mitigate line of site risk.

Carlos Osorio | Reuters

The report said it was ultimately the responsibility of the Secret Service to ensure appropriate mitigations are in place and ""escalate areas of difference between campaign staff and the service to their proper resolution."" Two hours before the assassination attempt, Crooks was able to operate a drone at the rally site at 3:51 p.m. for approximately 11 minutes. His drone went undetected because the Secret Service's counter drone system had a technical issue and was inoperative for many hours. In the end, the system did not start working more than a half hour after Crook used the drone. The report also describes the failure of Secret Service or local law enforcement officials to find Crooks, despite his being first identified as suspicious more than ninety minutes before he opened fire on Trump. Crooks was first identified by a local counter sniper team member about to go off duty. He sent a text to other counter snipers warning that Crooks had snuck into a parking lot that was intended to be off limits and had been blocked off by physical barriers. Most importantly, the leadership of Trump's Secret Service detail was never informed of a person acting suspiciously in the crowd before the former President took the stage, or in the minutes after Crooks had positioned himself on the roof of the building and was preparing to shoot. It was only at 6:09 pm, four minutes after Trump began to speak, that a Pennsylvania State Trooper stationed with Secret Service in the security room conveyed verbally that Crooks was the suspicious individual who had been ranging the stage and was now on the roof of a building.

A political action committee supporting former President Donald Trump has raised about $7.5 million in cryptocurrencies. Contributors to the Trump 47 joint fundraising committee donated bitcoin, ether and XRP , as well as the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins tether and USDC, to the GOP presidential nominee's campaign, according to a Federal Election Commission filing submitted on Tuesday. The PAC said the latest filing covered donations in the period of July 1 through Sept. 30, but numbers included cumulative contributions. With the 2024 election just three weeks away and the contest in a virtual dead heat, according to polling averages, Trump is counting on a hefty dose of funding from the crypto community. The former president has positioned himself as the pro-crypto candidate in this election, a reversal from his previous stance during his time in the White House. In May, he became the first major presidential candidate to accept donations in digital tokens. Nearly half of all the corporate money flowing into the election has come from the crypto industry, according to a recent report from the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen. The sum was raised from a mix of contributors, with Coinbase, Ripple, and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz accounting for most of those business donations. The industry has raised roughly 13 times the amount it brought in during the last presidential election year. At least 18 donors gave more than $5.5 million in bitcoin to Trump 47, the filing shows. Another seven people gave around $1.5 million in ether.

Contributors hailed from more than 15 states, including a few battlegrounds, plus the American territory of Puerto Rico. Their professions include Lockheed Martin software engineer, Duthie Power Services sales engineer and a producer for Esperanza Entertainment. David Bailey, CEO of media group BTC, gave more than $498,000 in bitcoin. Bailey was part of a small army of bitcoin fanatics who indoctrinated Trump in all things bitcoin and helped turned him from a skeptic to an evangelist. The process culminated in Trump headlining the biggest bitcoin conference of the year in Nashville, Tennessee, in July. Trump said in his keynote that his campaign had raised $25 million from the crypto industry, though he didn't specify the split between digital tokens and dollar donations. Among the new donors is Chase Herro, one of the co-founders of the Trump family's new crypto project World Liberty Financial. The platform, which has been described as a decentralized bank where customers will be encouraged to borrow, lend and invest in crypto, launched its token sale on Tuesday. So far, more than $10.2 million worth of WLFI tokens have been sold, far short of the initial fundraise goal of $300 million. The launch was plagued with technical issues, including the repeated crashing of the website where the sale was taking place. Mike Belshe, CEO of digital asset security company BitGo, has contributed almost $100,000 in bitcoin. Brian Murray, a partner at Craft Ventures, gave $6,560 in bitcoin. Craft was founded by pro-Trump venture capitalist David Sacks. Kresus Labs founder Trevor Traina gave more than $25,000 in ether, Chainstone Labs CEO Bruce Fenton donated $60,000 in bitcoin and Gary Cardone of Cardone Digital Ventures contributed over $840,000 in bitcoin. Ripple legal chief Stuart Alderoty contributed $300,000 in XRP, as CNBC previously reported. Alderoty attended a Trump fundraising event hosted by Sacks in San Francisco in June.

Alderoty is at odds with Ripple's billionaire co-founder Chris Larsen, who gave $1 million worth of XRP tokens to Future Forward, a super PAC that's supporting Vice President Kamala Harris' run for the White House. Future Forward began accepting donations in crypto in September. While Larsen shares the crypto industry's criticism of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the aggressive approach the Biden administration has taken toward companies in the space, the Ripple chairman said he has more confidence in Harris, in part because she's from the Bay Area. ""She knows people who have grown up in the innovation economy her whole life,"" Larsen told CNBC in an interview this week. ""So I think she gets it at a fundamental level, in a way that I think the Biden folks were just not paying attention to, or maybe just didn't make the connection between empowering workers and making sure you have American champions dominating their industries."" In addition to Larsen, Uniswap legal chief Marvin Ammori gave money to the Harris Action Fund. Like Ripple, Uniswap is battling claims it violated U.S. securities laws. On the pro-Trump side, billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss have led the charge, with an aggregate contribution of nearly $1.1 million each. Some of that money was refunded in September because it exceeded the maximum allowed.",Oct 16 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/15/trump-pac-has-raised-about-7point5-million-in-crypto-donations.html
Major Trump Media shareholder ARC Global unloads nearly all DJT stock,"One of the top shareholders of President-elect Donald Trump's media company has unloaded nearly his entire stake, a regulatory filing showed.

The Thursday night disclosure to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed that financial firm ARC Global Investments II and its manager, Patrick Orlando, no longer own more than 5% of Trump Media stock.

Orlando, the former CEO of the company that took Trump Media public in a special purpose acquisition company merger, and ARC, the sponsor of that merger, now hold just 30,147 DJT shares, or about 0.01% of the company's common stock, according to the SEC filing.

Trump Media reported in early September that ARC owned more than 11 million shares, equating to 5.4% of the company's outstanding stock.

In mid-September, a Delaware judge found that Trump Media breached an agreement with ARC and must grant it additional shares. The judge ordered that the parties work to make sure that ARC is able to sell or transfer its shares in time for the expiration of a lock-up agreement on Sept. 19.

As of Friday morning, ARC's diminished stake was worth about $850,000. ARC attorney Steven Fineman declined to comment on the sale.

Orlando and ARC indicated in the filing that the actions that required them to report the change took place Sept. 30. The timing of any specific stock sale was unclear.

The move by ARC and Orlando was revealed more than a month after another major stakeholder, United Atlantic Ventures, sold virtually its entire DJT stake.

Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social app, suffered a major sell-off in late summer and by the end of September was trading near its postmerger lows. But it saw a major stock rally in October that recovered most of those losses.

That surge came in the runup to the presidential election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Analysts say many of Trump Media's retail investors are fans of the Republican leader and are buying the company's stock as a way to support him and bet on his political fortunes.",Nov 15 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/djt-trump-media-stock-arc-global-patrick-orlando.html

"Trump plan would make Social Security insolvent in just 6 years, budget group says","""We find President Trump's campaign proposals would dramatically worsen Social Security's finances,"" the CRFB budget group said in a blog post.

The Republican nominee's proposals would also expand Social Security's cash shortfall by trillions of dollars and lead to even steeper benefit cuts in the coming years, said US Budget Watch 2024, a project of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Trump's agenda would make the popular government program, relied upon by millions of American seniors , insolvent in six years — shrinking the current timeline by a third, the group found.

The Trump campaign pushed back fiercely on the post.

""The so-called experts at CRFB have been consistently wrong throughout the years,"" spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNBC.

Trump ""will continue to strongly protect Social Security in his second term,"" Leavitt said. She claimed that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris posed the real threat to the program's solvency, arguing that her policies would usher in a flood of undocumented immigrants that would ""cause Social Security to buckle and collapse.""

Only certain noncitizens are eligible to qualify for Supplemental Security Income benefits.

Social Security trust funds are set to be exhausted by Fiscal Year 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Fiscal years begin in October.

The Social Security trustees' projections show the program's combined funds may only be able to pay full benefits until 2035. However, the trust fund Social Security relies on to pay retirement benefits may run out even sooner, in 2033.

Both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, have vowed to ""protect"" Social Security and the government-run health insurance program Medicare, while opposing any cuts.

At the same time, Trump has vowed to enact a growing list of tax cuts targeting key groups of Americans.

He has proposed eliminating taxes on seniors' Social Security benefits, ending taxes on service workers' tips and overtime wages, lowering the corporate tax rate even further, and imposing sweeping across-the-board tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods.

The tax-cut plans, along with Trump's pledge to carry out mass deportations as soon as he takes office, ""would all widen Social Security's cash deficits,"" the CRFB said in Monday's post.

Specifically, the group found that his agenda would:

Boost Social Security's 10-year shortfall by $2.3 trillion through FY 2035;

Accelerate its insolvency timeline to FY 2031 from FY 2034;

Cause a 33% across-the-board benefit cut in 2035 (up from the 23% cut the CBO currently projects);

Increase its annual shortfall by about 50% in FY 2035; and

Force an equivalent reduction of current benefits by about one third, or an increase in revenue by about one half, to restore Social Security's 75-year solvency.

Those findings are no surprise, given that Trump's plans involve cutting taxes that bring significant revenue to Social Security's trust funds, said Maria Freese, senior legislative representative at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

""If you cut income taxes and cut payroll taxes, then you're going to have an impact on Social Security,"" Freese said.

""Depending on the proposal that you're looking at, it could have a dramatic impact over time, and particularly when you're looking at a trust fund depletion date that's within the decade anyway,"" she said.

The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare has endorsed Harris for president.

""I don't believe the Trump campaign is looking to undermine Social Security,"" said Andrew Biggs, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and former principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration. ""I just don't believe it's front of mind for them as they put out various proposals.""

While certain proposals directly affect Social Security, such as ending taxes on benefits or certain kinds of income, other policies, such as curbing immigration, would also have consequences for the program, he said.

""It is such a large program that any policy that changes the economy or the tax code is likely to have some effect on Social Security,"" Biggs said. ""And likewise, Social Security is so big, any changes to Social Security will affect other things.""

With Social Security's funding depletion dates approaching, both campaigns could provide more details on how they would reform the program, he said.",Oct 21 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/trump-social-security-plan-insolvency-faster-study.html
Ukraine congratulates Trump — but a Republican win will scare Kyiv,"Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy meet at Trump Tower in New York City, U.S., September 27, 2024. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters

Ukraine congratulated Donald Trump ahead of him winning the U.S. election Wednesday morning, with Kyiv's leadership putting a brave face on a Republican victory that's seen as a bad outcome for the country in terms of military aid and, potentially, its territorial integrity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was among the first leaders to congratulate Trump, who declared victory in the presidential election early Wednesday morning. NBC News later projected him as president-elect, putting him on the path to become the 47th leader of the United States. Posting on X, Zelenskyy praised Trump on his ""impressive election victory"" and said he was optimistic that he and the former U.S. president, who has threatened to cut Ukraine funding quickly if elected, could work together toward peace in Ukraine. ""I appreciate President Trump's commitment to the 'peace through strength' approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together,"" Zelenskyy commented. It's possible that Republicans could achieve a clean sweep, winning control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. That would make it easy for a Republican administration to block future military funding for Ukraine.

Trump had previously boasted he could ""end the war"" in 24 hours if elected, signaling that he would pull the plug on Ukraine funding in order to force it into a negotiated settlement with Russia. Analysts say Ukraine could then be pushed into a ""bad peace"" with its powerful neighbor, and potentially forced to relinquish almost 20% of its territory in the south and east that's currently occupied by Russian forces. Ukraine is heavily reliant on its international partners for military, financial and humanitarian aid that enables it to continue functioning as a state, and fighting Russia after almost three years of war. The U.S. election, and the future of that funding and support, was seen as a make-or-break moment for Kyiv.

watch now

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine looked ""forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump's decisive leadership"" and that Kyiv ""continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States."" Ahead of the vote, a senior Ukrainian official told CNBC that a potential Republican halt to U.S. funding for Ukraine would be ""heavily unfavorable for Ukraine"" and that while Kyiv had its ""opinion about the different candidates,"" it hoped it could rely on U.S. support until it achieved victory and a ""just peace.""

Trump against more aid

Trump has been heavily critical of massive aid packages for Ukraine and has lambasted Zelenskyy, describing him in June as ""maybe the greatest salesman of any politician that's ever lived."" He suggested Ukraine's requests for — and receipt of — U.S. military aid packages were based on Zelenskyy's deftness and skills as a diplomat, rather than on Ukraine's actual needs. Trump added that ""every time he comes to our country, he walks away with $60 billion,"" referring to a major U.S. aid package wrangled over by Republicans and Democrats, and finally agreed in April.

To be sure, the stock is not necessarily a pure play on whether Trump wins. The stock is up a lot already this year and could be influenced by other factors, such as profit taking.

Indeed, Trump Media, which is majority-owned by Trump, has jumped more than 90% in 2024. But the stock has struggled recently as Vice President Kamala Harris appeared to gain momentum heading into Election Day. Shares have plummeted more than 34% over the past week despite a 12% jump on Monday.

Trump Media shares have seen huge retail trader inflows in the week's leading up to the election. It has also been the most-discussed stock on Reddit page WallStreetBets, which gained popularity during the GameStop fueled stock meme fad of 2021.

"Jeff Bezos defends Washington Post non-endorsement, says Americans 'don't trust' media","Amazon founder Jeff Bezos arrives for his meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the UK diplomatic residence in New York City, Sept. 20, 2021.

Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos on Monday defended his newspaper's controversial decision not to endorse a candidate in the presidential election as a ""meaningful step in the right direction"" to regain Americans' lost trust in news media.

But Bezos also said, ""I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it.""

""That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy.""

Bezos' comments in a Washington Post op-ed were published as the paper's editorial and circulation staff continued reeling from the paper's bombshell announcement Friday that it would no longer endorse candidates for the White House, after doing so for decades.

""Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,"" wrote Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon , who purchased the Post in 2013.

""No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, 'I'm going with Newspaper A's endorsement.' None,"" he wrote. ""What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence.""

""Ending them is a principled decision, and it's the right one.""

The op-ed — with the headline ""The hard truth: Americans don’t trust the news media — was published hours after NPR reported that The Washington Post had lost more than 200,000 digital subscribers since Friday's announcement by CEO Will Lewis of the end to endorsements.

Three members of the paper's editorial board have resigned from that panel, while retaining their staff roles at the Post, because of that decision.

Lewis has said that he made the decision.

But a Post article on Friday, citing four people who were briefed on the decision, reported that Bezos made that call, after a draft of the paper's endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris over GOP nominee Donald Trump was created.

Other news outlets have reported that Bezos pulled the plug on presidential endorsements.

In his op-ed Monday, Bezos wrote that the decision ""was made entirely internally.""

Bezos wrote, ""I would also like to be clear that no quid pro quo of any kind is at work here"" in deciding not to endorse a candidate.

He said that neither presidential campaign was consulted or told about the newspaper's decision.

But Bezos noted that Dave Limp, the CEO of his space exploration company Blue Origin, met with Trump on the same day Lewis announced the paper's decision.

""I sighed when I found out, because I knew it would provide ammunition to those who would like to frame this as anything other than a principled decision,"" Bezos wrote.

""But the fact is, I didn't know about the meeting beforehand. Even Limp didn't know about it in advance; the meeting was scheduled quickly that morning,"" Bezos wrote. ""There is no connection between it and our decision on presidential endorsements, and any suggestion otherwise is false.""

Bezos noted that in a recent Gallup poll, the media is the least trusted of 10 U.S. civic and political institutions.

""Something we are doing is clearly not working,"" he wrote.

Bezos said that newspapers, like voting machines, must be both accurate and have people believe they are accurate.

""It's a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement,"" Bezos wrote. ""Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn't see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose.""",Oct 28 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/28/washington-post-owner-jeff-bezos-says-in-op-ed-americans-dont-trust-the-news-media.html
Trump win and threat of more tariffs raises expectations for more China stimulus,"Chinese and U.S. flags flutter near The Bund, before U.S. trade delegation meet their Chinese counterparts for talks in Shanghai, China July 30, 2019. Aly Song | Reuters

BEIJING — Donald Trump's 2024 presidential win has raised the bar for China's fiscal stimulus plans, expected Friday. On the campaign trial, Trump threatened to impose additional tariffs of 60% or more on Chinese goods sold to the U.S. Increased duties of at least 10% under Trump's first term as president did not dent America's position as China's largest trading partner. But new tariffs — potentially on a larger scale — would come at a pivotal time for China. The country is relying more on exports for growth as it battles with a real estate slump and tepid consumer spending. If Trump raises tariffs to 60%, that could reduce China's exports by $200 billion, causing a 1 percentage point drag on GDP, Zhu Baoliang, a former chief economist at China's economic planning agency, said at a Citigroup conference.

Since late September, Chinese authorities have ramped up efforts to support slowing economic growth. The standing committee of the National People's Congress — the country's parliament — is expected to approve additional fiscal stimulus at its meeting this week, which wraps up Friday. ""In response to potential 'Trump shocks,' the Chinese government is likely to introduce greater stimulus measures,"" said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""The overlap of the NPC meeting with the U.S. election outcome suggests the government is prepared to take swift action."" She expects a stimulus package of more than 10 trillion yuan ($1.39 billion), with about 6 trillion yuan going towards local government debt swaps and bank recapitalization. More than 4 trillion yuan will likely go towards local government special bonds for supporting real estate, Su said. She did not specify over what time period.

Stock market divergence

Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks fell Wednesday as it became clear that Trump would win the election. U.S. stocks then soared with the three major indexes hitting record highs. In Thursday morning trading, Chinese stocks tried to hold mild gains. That divergence in stock performance indicates China's stimulus ""will be slightly bigger than the baseline scenario,"" said Liqian Ren, who leads WisdomTree's quantitative investment capabilities. She estimates Beijing will add about 2 trillion yuan to 3 trillion yuan a year in support. Ren doesn't expect significantly larger support due to uncertainties around how Trump might act. She pointed out that tariffs hurt both countries, but restrictions on tech and investment have a greater impact on China. Trump, during his first term as president, put Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei on a blacklist that restricted it from using U.S. suppliers. The Biden administration expanded on those moves by limiting U.S. sales of advanced semiconductors to China, and pressuring allies to do the same. Both Democrats and Republicans supported the passage of those newer export controls and efforts to boost semiconductor manufacturing investment in the U.S., Chris Miller, author of ""Chip War,"" pointed out earlier this year. He expected the U.S. to increase such restrictions regardless of who won the election. China has doubled down on bolstering its own tech by encouraging bank loans to high-end manufacturing. But the country had long benefited from U.S. capital as well as the ability to use U.S. software and high-end parts. Republicans gained a majority in the Senate for the next two years, according to NBC News projections, though control of the House of Representatives remains unclear. ""If the Republican Party gains control of Congress, protectionist measures could be accelerated, amplifying impacts on the global economy and presenting significant downside risks,"" Su said. She expects Trump will likely impose such tariffs in the first half of next year, and could speed up the process by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15% in response to a serious balance-of-payments deficit.

U.S. data shows that the trade deficit with China narrowed to $279.11 billion in 2023, from $346.83 billion in 2016. Su estimated that a 10% tariff increase on Chinese exports to the U.S. could reduce Beijing's real GDP growth by an average of 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points in the next two years, assuming other factors remain constant. China's exports to the U.S. fell by 14% last year to $500.29 billion, according to customs data on Wind Information. That's still up from $385.08 billion in 2016, before Trump was sworn in for his first term. Meanwhile, China's annual imports from the U.S. climbed to $164.16 billion in 2023, up from $134.4 billion in 2016, the Chinese data showed. Other analysts believe that Beijing will remain conservative, and trickle out stimulus over the coming months rather than release a large package on Friday. China's top leaders typically meet in mid-December to discuss economic plans for the year ahead. Then, officials would announce the growth target for the year at an annual parliamentary meeting in March. ""China will likely face much higher tariff from the U.S. next year. I expect policy response from China to also take place next year when higher tariff is imposed,"" Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note Wednesday afternoon. ""I also don't think the government will change the policies they already proposed to the NPC because of US election,"" he said.

Solar stocks sold off Wednesday after Donald Trump secured a second trip to the White House and Republicans won control of the Senate.

Solar stocks are falling on fears that Trump's second term would spell trouble for the Inflation Reduction Act, which has fueled a clean energy boom in the U.S. through tax credits to expand solar energy.

NBC News projected that Trump had gained a sizable Electoral College lead to win the presidency early Wednesday morning.

The benchmark Invesco Solar ETF closed nearly 11% lower, while the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF shed more than 7%.

Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell about about 10%. Residential solar stocks Sunrun and Sunnova plummeted more than 29% and more than 51%, respectively.

Inverter manufacturers Enphase and SolarEdge tumbled about nearly 17% and about 22%, respectively. Sun tracker manufacturers Nextracker and Array lost about 6% and nearly 22%, respectively.

Trump's campaign platform calls for the termination of the IRA, which he refers to as the ""Socialist Green New Deal."" The IRA is one of President Joe Biden's signature achievements. The law passed on party-line vote in 2022 without any Republican support.

The future of the IRA, however, will depend not only on whether Trump wins the White House, but whether Republicans also secure unified control of Congress.

"Trump Media CFO, two other insiders sell millions of dollars worth of DJT stock","The chief financial officer of Trump Media and two other corporate insiders sold more than $16 million worth of company stock in the week following the presidential election, according to new disclosures.

Most of the stock was sold by CFO Phillip Juhan, who in August adopted a trading plan that revealed his intention to sell 400,000 DJT shares by December 2025.

Trump Media director Eric Swider and Scott Glabe, the company's general counsel, each sold fewer shares of the company, whose majority owner Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 5.

Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social app, has a market capitalization of $6.3 billion despite reporting revenue of slightly more than just $1 million in the third quarter of this year.

The company, whose share price has dramatically fluctuated since the stock became publicly traded in late March, reported losses of $19.2 million for the quarter.

Truth Social's daily active user rate is minuscule compared to other social media apps.

Similarweb, a digital intelligence platform, reported that Truth Social had about 200,000 daily active users on Nov. 6, the day after Election Day. By contrast, the social media site X had 36.7 million users that day, Threads had 4.7 million users and Bluesky had about one million users.

Juhan, who is also Trump Media's treasurer, sold 320,000 shares on Friday at a price of $30.65 per share, or a total of $9.8 million worth of stock according to a Form 4 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Elon Musk attends Trump's first postelection meeting with House Republicans in D.C.,"Elon Musk, pictured in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 13, 2024, has hit out at the British government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Elon Musk on Wednesday joined President-elect Donald Trump for his first postelection meeting with the House Republican conference in Washington, D.C., an advisor to Trump told NBC News. Trump and Musk flew to the nation's capital together from Florida aboard Trump's plane.

The development is the latest example of how Musk, the world's richest man and one of the top backers of Trump's winning campaign, has grown his presence and influence in the future president's orbit.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has spent the past week in Palm Beach, where Trump, from his resort home Mar-a-Lago, has been assembling his second administration. Musk has been alongside Trump in nearly every meeting, The New York Times reported.

On Tuesday evening, Trump announced that ""the Great Elon Musk"" and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy would lead an outside commission called the ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" which aims to ""dismantle government bureaucracy"" and cut regulations.",Nov 13 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/elon-musk-trump-house-republicans.html
 Crypto's $245 million campaign finance operation filled airwaves with ads not about crypto,"Stand With Crypto's bus tour through five battleground states kicked off last week in Phoenix and Las Vegas. Logan Dobson/Stand With Crypto Alliance

LAS VEGAS — In Nevada's 4th Congressional District, a crypto PAC spent nearly $2 million on ads this cycle to support the reelection of Steven Horsford, a Democratic congressman who's voted in favor of some major pro-crypto bills. But watching the ads, you'd learn nothing about that agenda. ""He's leading on jobs, bringing good paying union jobs to Nevada and rebuilding our infrastructure,"" one 30-second commercial says. ""He capped insulin prices at $35 a month"" and ""worked multiple jobs to support his hard-working single mother and siblings."" The ad wraps up with the disclosure, ""Fairshake is responsible for the content of this ad."" Fairshake was the largest crypto-aligned super PAC in the 2024 election cycle, spending piles of cash to support crypto allies and vote out antagonists across the country. The group brought in $170 million, accounting for a huge chunk of the amount raised by crypto-related PACs and other groups, which totaled more than $245 million, according to Federal Election Commission data.

Crypto has accounted for nearly half of all corporate money flowing into the election, according to a report from nonprofit watchdog Public Citizen. No other sector is close. That includes oil companies and banks, which have historically been big political contributors. Crypto even outpaced Elon Musk, the world's richest person, who spent tens of millions of dollars to try to get Republican nominee former President Donald Trump back in the White House in his contest against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. A big part of the crypto industry's strategy when it came to distributing cash was to identify key races and then flood the zone. Industry advocacy group Stand With Crypto Alliance, launched by Coinbase last year, developed a grading system for the presidential race and for House and Senate candidates across the country, helping it determine where to spend. Horsford received an A grade based on his public comments and his voting history while in office. His campaign received money from Fairshake as well as individual donations from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, venture capitalist and longtime crypto investor Reid Hoffman, and billionaire twins Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss.

Nevada is home to two of the thirteen ""critical elections"" singled out by Stand with Crypto, a designation the group defines as races that are ""critical to the future of crypto in America."" In addition to Horsford's election, the other Nevada race is the Senate contest between Democratic incumbent Jackie Rosen and Republican challenger Sam Brown. Both candidates received an A grade. According to data shared by Stand with Crypto, 385,000 Nevadans are crypto owners, and more than 16,000 people in the state have signed up to be advocates for the group, which made a stop in Las Vegas in September as part of a multi-state tour. The other races deemed critical were for Senate in Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Massachusetts, Michigan, Wisconsin and Maryland, and for specific House contests in Colorado, Iowa and Oregon. To reach potential voters, Fairshake isn't talking a lot about crypto. Nor are its affiliate PACs, which have names like Defend American Jobs and Protect Progress. They've collectively spent more than $135 million this cycle, mostly on ads. ""Not mentioning crypto assets explicitly is probably a savvy move to avoid alienating voters who prefer traditional currencies and might be put off by connections to crypto,"" said David Nickerson, an associate professor of political science at Temple University who worked in the analytics department for President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.

watch now

The biggest single target of crypto money this cycle was Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Democratic chair of the Senate Banking Committee. Brown backed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in holding hearings on whether digital tokens were tied to terrorism. In December, Brown told journalists that he wasn't concerned about the crypto industry's rumblings against him. ""Bring 'em on,"" Politico quoted Brown as saying to a crowd of reporters. Some $40 million of crypto money has been directed at defeating Brown, and one PAC has paid for five ads designed to boost awareness of Republican rival Bernie Moreno, a blockchain entrepreneur. The race is crucial in determining which party will control the Senate. Protect Progress, a PAC affiliated with Fairshake, has given more than $10 million apiece to Senate candidates in Arizona and Michigan. In Arizona, the group favors Democrat Ruben Gallego, who is vying for the seat being vacated by Kyrsten Sinema. In Michigan, the preferred choice is Elissa Slotkin, who is currently a Democratic House member. Democratic Rep. Katie Porter of California lost in the primary for Senate after Fairshake spent over $10 million in ads against her. Defend American Jobs spent more than $3 million to support Republican Jim Justice in West Virginia, who has been declared the winner, replacing exiting Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.

Trump campaign accuses UK's Labour Party of election 'interference',"Republican presidential nominee former U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Greensboro Coliseum, in Greensboro, North Carolina, U.S. October 22, 2024.

Donald Trump's campaign has accused British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party of ""blatant foreign interference"" in the U.S. presidential election after its volunteers travelled to the United States to help campaign for Kamala Harris.

The campaign has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in Washington, calling for an immediate investigation into what it called ""apparent illegal foreign national contributions made by the Labour Party of the United Kingdom and accepted by Harris for President"".

The complaint cited media reports and a now deleted LinkedIn post from Sofia Patel, head of operations at Britain's Labour Party, who wrote that ""nearly 100"" current and former Labour party staff would be travelling to the U.S. in the coming weeks to help elect Harris, the Democratic vice-president.

""Those searching for foreign interference in our elections need to look no further than [the] LinkedIn post,"" the letter of complaint said. ""The interference is occurring in plain sight.""

The centre-left Labour Party, which sees the U.S. Democrats as its sister party, swept to power in July. Starmer has since sought to build ties with Trump, meeting him at his Trump Tower during a visit to New York in September.

Starmer, travelling on a flight to Samoa, told reporters he did not expect the complaint to strain relations with Trump if he wins the election on Nov. 5, adding Labour volunteers had gone to pretty much every U.S. election.

""They're doing it in their spare time, they're doing it as volunteers, they're staying I think with other volunteers over there,"" he said.

""That's what they've done in previous elections, that's what they're doing in this election and that's really straightforward.""",Oct 23 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/23/trump-campaign-accuses-uks-labour-party-of-election-interference-.html
Election betting: Appeals court fast-tracks CFTC challenge to Kalshi political bets,"People vote on the first day of Virginia's in-person early voting at Long Bridge Park Aquatics and Fitness Center on September 20, 2024 in Arlington, Virginia.

A federal appeals court has fast-tracked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's case challenging the right of the event exchange Kalshi to offer U.S. political election contracts.

The expedited appeal comes as Kalshi and another platform, Interactive Brokers , are offering an array of political contracts, including bets on the outcomes of the U.S. presidential election, U.S. Senate races, and party control of each chamber of Congress.

Kalshi touted its presidential election contracts on electronic signs in New York City's Times Square over the weekend.

The quick appellate schedule calls for the CFTC to file its legal brief by Wednesday and for Kalshi to respond with its brief by Nov. 15 — 10 days after Election Day. The CFTC will then have until Dec. 6 to file a reply to Kalshi's brief.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit directed the court's clerk to schedule oral arguments on the ""first appropriate date"" after that reply is filed.

It normally takes months in federal appeals courts for briefing and oral arguments to occur.

The CFTC had requested oral arguments on Dec. 2.

A commission spokesperson declined to comment on the schedule.

In an Oct. 2 court filing, the CFTC argued that a quick resolution of the appeal is in the public's interest.

The CFTC told the appellate court that election contracts ""are susceptible to market manipulation"" and also pose a risk to election integrity or how the public views the integrity of elections.

Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour, in a statement, said his company is ""confident"" that the law allows election contracts.

Kalshi is ""looking forward to continuing to show how powerful these markets are at promoting election integrity and bringing more truth to the system!"" Mansour said.

The CFTC in September lost a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., seeking to block Kalshi from offering contracts on which political parties would win control of both chambers of Congress in November.

The commission quickly appealed that ruling to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which promptly issued an injunction temporarily barring Kalshi from accepting congressional control contracts.

But the appeals court lifted that legal freeze on Oct. 2, saying the CFTC had failed to show that the commission or the public would be ""irreparably injured"" without that injunction remaining in effect during the appeal.

Kalshi resumed offering its congressional contracts, and then contracts on the outcome of the presidential election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, and other races.

As of Monday, Kalshi had booked more than $7 million in contracts on the presidential election outcome.",Oct 14 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/election-bets-appeals-court-fast-tracks-cftc-vs-kalshi-case.html
"A majority of Senate Republicans doubt Matt Gaetz will be confirmed as attorney general, sources say"," U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) arrives to a House Republican candidate forum to hear from members running for U.S. Speaker of House in the Longworth House Office Building on October 11, 2023 in Washington, DC.

More than half of Senate Republicans, including some in senior leadership positions, privately say they don't see a path for former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., to be confirmed as attorney general and would not support him to lead the Department of Justice, according to multiple people who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity.

While Gaetz's ability to be confirmed appears on the rocks among Senate Republicans, President-elect Donald Trump's team remains confident he will eventually be confirmed, even if it's after an ugly battle.

NBC News spoke to more than 15 additional Republican sources who agreed that there are not enough votes in the Senate to confirm Gaetz, and some estimated that closer to 30 Republicans consider him unqualified.

Gaetz and Trump attorney Todd Blanche are moving full speed ahead on trying to fill out the Justice Department, according to sources familiar with the planning. If confirmed, Blanche would serve in the powerful No. 2 position at the Justice Department, overseeing all U.S. attorney's offices throughout the country.

""President Trump and his team are focused on and confident in the confirmation of AG-designee Gaetz,"" a person familiar with Trump's thinking told NBC News.

Vice President-elect JD Vance and his aides have also been working the phones over the last two days to get a read on where senators stand on Gaetz.

Trump announced he was choosing Gaetz for the attorney general role on Wednesday, writing in a post on Truth Social, ""Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System. Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations, and restore Americans' badly shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.""

When the president-elect initially publicized his pick, many Republicans — except for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who got a heads-up from Trump — were in complete shock.

In his few terms in the House, Gaetz has often been embroiled in controversy.

He was investigated by the Justice Department in a case involving the alleged sex trafficking of a 17-year-old girl, though the former congressman, who resigned his post shortly after he was picked for attorney general, has always denied the allegations and has never been criminally charged.

On Thursday, though, a lawyer for the 17-year-old girl wrote in a post on X, saying, ""She was a high school student and there were witnesses"" when the alleged incident occurred.

The attorney, John Clune, also called for the release of a House Ethics Committee report detailing the committee's investigation into Gaetz, which has been ongoing for several years.

""If they want to send [the report] that'd be fine,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a staunch Trump ally, told reporters at the Capitol this week, though he added in a statement from his office that he planned to vote to confirm each of the president-elect's judicial nominees.

On Friday, Johnson said he would ""strongly request"" that the report not be released publicly, though several Republican senators have said they would like to view the report as part of their deliberation process ahead of a confirmation vote.

""I don't want there to be any limitation at all on what the Senate can consider,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters at the Capitol this week when asked whether the Senate Judiciary Committee should be privy to the report.

""We need to have a complete vetting of the nominees, not only so we know that the nominee is qualified, but also to protect the president,"" he added.

""I think when you're at this point, particularly given his abrupt departure from Congress just prior to that report coming out, considering the job that he is being appointed to, considering that the FBI is going to do a background check anyway, I can't imagine that the committee is not going to want to see it,"" said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. ""So, at the very least, those of us that will have a vote at some point, starting with the Judiciary Committee, should see that. And I can't imagine they won't.""

The House Ethics Committee was expected to meet on Friday to decide whether to release its report on Gaetz, whom it has been investigating on and off since 2021, according to a source with direct knowledge. The panel abruptly canceled the meeting, which House Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest, R-Miss., insisted was only postponed.

Later on Friday, an attorney for another woman interviewed by the House Ethics Committee said that his client ""testified to the House Ethics Committee that she witnessed Rep. Gaetz having sex with a minor at a house party in Orlando in 2017.""

Several Republicans shared that Gaetz, who was investigated by the very agency he could now oversee, has a ""steep hill"" to climb toward confirmation in the Senate.

""I would guess if we had a vote today on the Senate floor, it might be more than that,"" Cramer said Thursday when pressed whether 10 Senate Republicans could vote to oppose Gaetz — as Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal suggested to NBC News earlier that day. ""I have concerns that he can't get across the finish line, and we're gonna spend a lot of political capital … on something that even if they got it done, you'd have to wonder if it was worth it.""

NBC News spoke to additional sources who put the unofficial tally closer to 30. Republicans who oppose Gaetz now could still ultimately vote to confirm him when the time comes, especially if pressure from Trump mounts.

If Republicans wind up with 53 seats in the upper chamber after the recount in Pennsylvania's Senate race is concluded, Gaetz will not be confirmed if more than three GOP Senators vote against him (Vance could break a tie as the president of the Senate).        

Republicans like Cramer have also cautioned Trump not to jam someone like Gaetz through in a recess appointment, which would bypass the Senate confirmation process.

Shortly after he was projected to win the presidential election, Trump wrote a post on Truth Social urging Republicans running to be the next Senate majority leader to allow him to use recess appointments to confirm a Cabinet quickly.

This style of nomination would bypass the normal appointment process, leaving the Senate entirely out of the equation, by allowing Trump to appoint members of his Cabinet while both chambers of Congress are in periods of recess that last days or weeks.

The House and Senate currently gavel in for pro forma sessions while in recess to prevent the president from taking such steps to appoint Cabinet members.

Since the Truth Social post, Trump has not asked for any specific Cabinet pick, including Gaetz, to be confirmed via recess appointment.

""If the obstructionists are the other party, and you have the votes to confirm somebody, then I think you could make an ethical decision to provide that opportunity, that constitutional opportunity,"" Cramer said. ""On the other hand, if the opposition is preventing you from doing it with your own party, I think it runs a couple of risks. You could do it, but you'd have a very weak Cabinet secretary.""",Nov 16 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/16/a-majority-of-senate-republicans-doubt-matt-gaetz-will-be-confirmed-as-attorney-general-sources-say.html?__source=androidappshare
"Gold touches record peak on U.S. election jitters, Mid-East woes","Gold prices hit a record high on Tuesday, as uncertainties surrounding the U.S. presidential election and the Middle East conflict, along with expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, boosted bullion's appeal.

Spot gold was up 1% at $2,769.25 per ounce as of 10:17 a.m ET (1417 GMT), after hitting a record high of $2,772.42 earlier in the session.

U.S. gold futures settled 0.9% higher at $2,781.1.

Bullion thrives in a low interest-rate environment and is considered a hedge against market volatilities. Gold prices have surged more than 34% so far this year.

Gold is supported by safe-haven bets as geopolitical tensions and political uncertainty continue, with Japan now being added into the mix on the political uncertainty front after the weekend election, said Peter Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals.

Republican former U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris are also caught in a tight race for the White House.

On the geopolitical front, at least 93 Palestinians were killed or missing in an Israeli strike in northern Gaza, the Gaza health ministry said.

Investors await a series of economic data, including ADP employment, U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures, and payrolls report to further gauge the Fed's policy stance, with its next rate decision on Nov. 7.

Markets are currently pricing in a 98% chance for a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed in November.

""Gold should retain its upward bias and may even flirt with $2,800 in the days ahead, as long as U.S. election risks continue weighing on market sentiment, while Fed rate cut expectations remain intact,"" said Han Tan, chief market analyst at Exinity Group.

Gold prices' rally is set to extend into 2025, as a favourable U.S. interest rate backdrop and geopolitical tensions continue to burnish its appeal, a Reuters poll showed.

However, buyers in India brushed off record high prices, making purchases for the Dhanteras and Diwali festivals.

Trump victory deals latest heavy blow to a struggling Germany,"Olaf Scholz, Germany's chancellor, during a news conference at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, on Monday, Nov. 4, 2024. Krisztian Bocsi | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Donald Trump's election as U.S. president could mark yet another major blow for the struggling German economy. Germany narrowly, and unexpectedly, skirted a technical recession in the third quarter, with preliminary data showing its gross domestic product grew by 0.2% after a 0.3% contraction in the previous quarter. The print came after the German economy ministry in October said it was now expecting the country's economy will contract, rather than grow this year. Not only is the country's economy struggling to pick up pace, but a series of key indicators have also been painting a lackluster picture. That includes Germany's composite PMI, which rose slightly in October, but remained in contraction territory, according to data from S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank published Wednesday. Trump's victory could make matters worse. ""Donald Trump's likely election victory marks the beginning of the most difficult economic moment in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany,"" Moritz Schularick, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, said in a note after Trump claimed victory. ""In addition to the domestic structural crisis, the country now faces massive foreign trade and security policy challenges for which we are not prepared,"" Schularick said, adding that the economic policies outlined by Trump will put additional pressure on growth across Europe.

Reliance on exports

The German economy is heavily reliant on exports — and Trump is set to slap tariffs and other restrictions on imports. The German statistics office Destatis last month said that the U.S.' importance as a trading partner for Germany has been growing. The U.S. has been Germany's second largest trading partner behind China since 2021, but overtook Beijing in the first half of this year. Around 9.9% of German exports went to the U.S. in 2023 in terms of value, according to Destatis. Trump has previously suggested he could put blanket tariffs of 10% to 20% on almost all imports, if he were elected, regardless of their origin. German exporters may therefore now suffer, the ifo economic institute said in a note on Wednesday. ""German exporters ... must expect severe losses if Trump makes good on his threat to impose basic tariffs of 20 percent on US imports from all trading partners,"" it said. ""These measures by the re-elected US President would mean considerable economic damage of EUR 33 billion in Germany alone,"" ifo added, estimating that German exports to the U.S. could shed roughly 15% as a result. Morningstar DBRS meanwhile identified autos and chemicals as two of the sectors most exposed to potential Trump tariffs — both of which historically have been key pillars of the German industry. Lisandra Flach, director of the ifo Center for International Economics, said that Germany and the European Union must now take their own measures, as they need to anticipate the U.S. distancing itself from global cooperation. ""Germany and the EU must now strengthen their position through measures of their own. These include deeper integration of the EU services market and credible retaliatory measures against the US,"" she said.

That's a daunting challenge.,"Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan, U.S., November 1, 2024 (L), and Democratic presidential nominee U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign event in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., October 19, 2024.

A flurry of remarkably good economic news over the past week could create a daunting mandate for whoever is elected the next U.S. president: Don't mess it up.

Days ahead of the Nov. 5 election, inflation is expected to cool even further from its pandemic peaks, private job creation is beating estimates, pending home sales data is popping, consumer sentiment is surging toward optimism and gross domestic product is growing apace, though slightly below some expectations.

The S&P 500 is up over 50% since President Joe Biden took office in January, 2021, and 24% so far this year, according to Morning Consult.

""Remember how we were going into a depression and all that stuff. Guess what? We have the strongest economy in the world. The whole damn world,"" President Joe Biden said Tuesday during an event announcing new infrastructure grants at the Port of Baltimore.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both pitching themselves as the best steward of the future health of the U.S. economy.

At the same time, both candidates are working to frame themselves as a departure from the status quo, recognizing voters' lingering dissatisfaction with the economy, despite the strong macro-level data.

Forty-four percent of U.S. adult respondents say they believe that ""total economic collapse"" is at least somewhat, if not very, likely, according to an October YouGov poll. The poll surveyed 1,113 U.S. adult citizens from Oct.17 to Oct. 19 and had a margin of error of plus/minus 3.8 percentage points.

The mood of economic pessimism within the electorate has prompted both Trump and Harris to roll out a slate of policy proposals that promise a new economic future for Americans.

Trump has pledged universal tariffs on all imports from all countries, a sweeping immigrant deportation program, deepening corporate tax cuts and more.

Economists and even some of Trump's own allies note that his proposed universal tariffs, mass deportations and tax cuts could, at least temporarily, send major shockwaves through the economy, triggering potential market crashes.

Harris, meanwhile, wants to hike corporate tax rates, enact a federal ban on corporate ""price gouging"" in the grocery sector, and provide subsidies and tax credits for housing development, child care and more.

The vice president has faced criticism from economists and leaders in corporate America for her proposed price gouging ban, and her plans to hike taxes on corporations.

The stable economy will be an opportunity for the next president to actually focus on the policies on which they campaigned, said Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan.

By contrast, both former President Barack Obama and Biden took office during a time when ""stabilizing the economy would have to come before any of their normal governing priorities,"" Wolfers said. ""What they got to do was put out the recessionary fire rather than pursue their programs.""

The present reality makes the presidential election even more consequential, Wolfers said.

""If you're in a middle of a recession, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, you've got one job: Fix the recession,"" he said. ""Whereas if, for instance, what Trump wants is tax cuts for the rich and what Harris wants is to tax the rich in order to give cuts to the middle and working class, they might each have the scope to do it.""",Nov 2 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/02/harris-trump-election-booming-us-economy-challenge.html
"The presidential election is prompting some Americans to 'doom spend,' report finds","Retail therapy is thinly coating voters' anxieties from the presidential election — and their wallets know it. About 27% of polled shoppers say they are ""doom spending"" — that is, spending cash despite concerns about the economy and foreign affairs — according to a new report by Intuit Credit Karma. The habit is more prevalent among younger generations, with 37% of Gen Zers and 39% of millennials saying they do it. Follow: Election 2024 live updates: Trump and Harris await Presidential election results More than half, or 60%, of Americans surveyed are concerned with the state of the world and economy, more than they were a year ago. The site polled 1,001 U.S. adults in late October. Top worries among doom spenders include the cost of living (55%), inflation (43%), and the presidential election (28%), the report found.

More than a third, 36%, of respondents say they can't rationalize saving money due to feelings of uncertainty about the world and economy, per Intuit Credit Karma. That jumps to 47% of Gen Z and 43% of millennials.

Shoppers want a 'sense of control'

'It's a tough cycle to break'

Doom spending can lead to bigger financial woes. Credit card balances reached $1.14 trillion in the second quarter of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As of June, 50% of cardholders carry a balance every month on their credit cards, a recent Bankrate survey found. ""The share who pay in full now is actually the lowest in four years,"" Rossman said. Cardholders are also carrying the debt for longer. About six out of every 10 people who have credit card debt have had it for at least a year, Bankrate found.

""It's a tough cycle to break,"" Rossman said, especially as interest rates remain fairly high for everyday cards. The average annual percentage rate for credit cards is around 20.50%, down from a record high of 20.79% in August, according to Bankrate.com. The average APR for retail credit cards is 30.45%, a high, Bankrate found. Election-related doom spending also comes just ahead of the busy holiday shopping season. About 20% of Americans plan to go into credit card debt this holiday season to pay for celebrations and obligations, according to Morning Consult. Credit card balances can be very sticky. About 28% of 2023 holiday shoppers are still paying off debt they took on last year, NerdWallet found after polling 2,079 adults in September. ""Credit card debt is growing at the fastest rate among Gen Z and millennials,"" Alev said.

Credit card balances are up by 66% for Gen Zers and 52% for millennials since March 2022 when the Fed started to hike interest rates, Alev said, citing Credit Karma member data. The more debt you put on, the harder it will be to save money, she said. ""We are seeing these two things come together to really negatively affect the lives of many younger consumers,"" Alev said.

What a Republican sweep in Congress could mean for the stock market—in one chart,"From left, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., attend a Menorah lighting to celebrate the eight-day festival of Hanukkah, in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, December 12, 2023.

Former President Donald Trump has won the 2024 election, sweeping into office on a wave of support for Republican candidates. NBC News reports that the previously Democrat-controlled Senate will have a Republican majority. It's too early to determine which party will win the majority in the House of Representatives, but should Republicans retain control, the party will be in position to set forth the agenda that Trump laid out on the campaign trail. For stock investors, the occupant of the Oval Office doesn't matter much. After all, the S&P 500 has gone up during 17 of the last 20 four-year presidential terms. But some investors may be eying the pending House races closely. ""What tends to do better for investors is not so much who is in the White House. It's the makeup of Congress,"" says Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group.

Specifically, stocks tend to do better with a divided government. From 1951 through 2023, the S&P 500 has returned an annual average of 8% under single-party rule, compared with a 9.9% average gain when different parties control the presidency and at least one chamber of Congress, according to data provided by the Carson Group. A divided Congress in particular tends to bode well for investors, with average yearly gains of 15.7% under Democratic presidents and 13.7% under Republican presidents. Should the S&P 500 finish out 2024 up from the previous year (it's currently up about 25%), it will mark 14 consecutive years of positive returns under split Congresses.

"Trump vow on new trade war sends shockwaves through supply chain, importers scramble to move up orders","According to spot ocean freight rate data tracked by ocean and air freight intelligence platform, Xeneta, the frontloading of freight during the Trump trade war on Chinese imports in 2018 fueled a rise in ocean container shipping freight rates by more than 70%.

Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, said in the short-term there will be a surge in import demand for containerized goods as U.S. companies stock up ahead of any new tariffs. ""Especially related to goods which are not time sensitive, said Jensen. ""This will create upward pressure on freight rates in the coming months.""

The knee-jerk reaction in shares of ocean carriers, was negative, with a big slump led by Maersk , even though consumer demand remains strong in the U.S. and frontloading of imports would raise ocean rates, at least in the short-term. Shipping analysts described the reaction in Maersk and its peers as excessive. But they added it is based on the belief is tariffs increase the costs of trade, in turn lowering demand and volumes. They noted that did not occur in 2018 and 2019, with volumes growing an average of 12% during those two years. ""It speaks to the uncertainty of the situation, rather than the imminent doom,"" wrote analyst Ben Slupecki of Morningstar in an email.

Among many major market moves on Wednesday as traders and investors digested the Republican wins, the U.S. dollar surged against key international currencies tied to trade on Wednesday, such as the euro and Mexican peso .

Brashier expects Trump's election to result in increased container demand and vessel bookings, which will then fuel freight rates, trucking and warehouse rates. Trucking stocks, such as J.B. Hunt Transport Services , Knight-Swift , Schneider National , and XPO , were in rally mode on Wednesday, as were freight rails including Norfolk Southern and CSX .

""This is 2018 all over again,"" said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain for ITS Logistics, referring to the year during which Trump first imposed sweeping tariffs in his first term. ""The calls expand beyond shippers who have Chinese imports. The global tariff threat is fueling calls for frontloading from all around the globe,"" he said.

Trump has vowed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports arriving into the United States and a 60%-100% tariff on Chinese imports.

Retailers and manufacturing companies have been increasingly calling logistics partners, both in the days leading up to presidential election and on Election Night, about ""front loading"" shipments ahead of any changes in tariff policy to be pursued by President-elect Donald Trump , who campaigned on an aggressive expansion of existing U.S. tariffs on cross-border trade.

Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Xeneta, tells CNBC that shippers will be fearing more of the same with this latest tariff threat. ""Shipping is a global industry feeding on international trade, so another Trump presidency is a step in the wrong direction,"" said Sand. ""The knee-jerk reaction from U.S. shippers will be to frontload imports before Trump is able to impose his new tariffs.""

He added that fears of an increase to a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, compared to 25% in 2018, would make the incentive to frontload ""even greater.""

Slupecki said via email the drop in ocean carriers could present a buying opportunity, but he hesitated to say Maersk will profit from front-loading the election, as there are many other issues in global trade to weigh. He continues to hold a fair value weighting on Maersk and described the drop as an overreaction. ""Potential tariffs cause uncertainty but not certain poor performance, as evidenced by performance of these names during the prior tariffs of 2018.""

""A wave of pre-ordering by retailers"" ahead of new tariffs would be good for ocean carrier earnings power, according to Jefferies analyst Omar Nokta. However, he said overall volume gains are uncertain and longer-term, the issue is the potential significant slowdown in trade volumes in the coming years. ""Global trade volumes have risen by 2x the rate of GDP growth this year, and are likely moderate to 1x in 2025, but could fall below that should tariffs impact trade patterns, which would be negative for ocean carrier earnings,"" he wrote.

Republican tariff policy remains difficult to predict

Trump has vowed to move fast on tariffs, with Robert Lighthizer, former U.S. Trade Representative during the first Trump term, telling Wall Street money managers in recent weeks that if Trump was reelected, he could start implementing his sweeping tariff proposals quickly after taking office, according to policy analysts at Piper Sandler.

But trade experts expressed caution on reading too much into Trump's tariff threats right now when attempting to analyze where policy ends up. Matthew Rubel, who served on the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy Negotiation for the White House and USTR for both Presidents Obama and Trump, tells CNBC he does not see a global tariff as an outcome. In negotiations, everything will be on the table.

""Tariffs are a tool to be used as an offense to ensure we can trade freely and can build jobs domestically strategically in appropriate categories,"" said Rubel. ""Lighthizer, under Trump brought to life a policy which negotiated from strength and focused on bilateral agreements. The deals will be crafted to ensure we gain economically. It is nuanced and not one size fits all. Trump's administration will be clear on a business case,"" he said.

Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group, said the impact of the tariffs will depend on the execution.

""Depend a lot on whether there will be selective tariffs on certain products/industries or will it be a scattershot approach that sprays them on all imports,"" said Boockvar. ""The former the market can tolerate, the latter I don't believe it will.""

""It is an open question what level of tariffs will be imposed,"" Jensen said. ""Trump has mentioned anything between 100-500% and it is therefore completely unknown what will actually transpire. But, again, that means significant uncertainty for U.S. importers, and the only way to reduce the uncertainty will be to import goods earlier.""

Stephen Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said he expects Trump to announce new tariffs ""in the first few days of his presidency.""

""Companies are deploying a range of strategies to mitigate the inflationary impact these import taxes will soon have. Unfortunately, there are no good tariff mitigation strategies; the challenge is to find the one that is least bad,"" Lamar said.

He added that bringing in product before the inauguration is one approach, but it only provides temporary relief and the import surge this will create is further complicated by upcoming freight issues, including the threat of another labor strike at East Coast ports, and the Lunar New Year, both in the second half of January.

""We will be working with the new Administration and Congress to make sure any new tariffs do not add to the regressive, misogynistic burden hard-working Americans already feel as a result of the existing tariff structure,"" Lamar said.

National Retail Federation president and CEO Matthew Shay said in an email statement that his group is prepared to work with President-Elect Trump and Congress on effective trade policies that will increase America's competitive advantages in research, development and innovation, and will protect strategically critical infrastructure. ""However, the adoption of across-the-board tariffs on consumer goods and other non-strategic imports amounts to a tax on American families. It will drive inflation and price increases and will result in job losses,"" he added.

Mexico trade boom could be target

In addition to the tariffs, the future of the three-country free trade agreement that replaced NAFTA, USMCA, will also be a subject of renegotiation in 2026. President-elect Trump has already said he wants to renegotiate the USMCA deal he made in 2020. One key provision was a requirement for the countries to begin reviewing the trade deal after six years, a process that will begin in July 2026. Chinese manufacturing in Mexico to circumvent the Trump/Biden tariffs will be a likely part of the trade renegotiation.

3 ways President-elect Donald Trump's next term may impact student loan borrowers,"Most federal student loan borrowers weren't making payments when Former President Donald Trump left office in 2021, due to the pandemic forbearance he initiated in March 2020. And at least 8 million borrowers currently enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education repayment plan won't be making payments as he returns to the White House. Student debt was not as much of a hallmark campaign issue in the 2024 presidential election as it was in 2020. As such, it's not explicitly clear how President-elect Donald Trump plans to approach it. He hasn't made any indication he's interested in forgiving student debt and has called some of Biden's initiatives ""vile."" But moves he made during his previous term in office and comments made along the campaign trail show some potential outcomes. Here are three ways a Trump presidency could impact student loan borrowers.

1. The SAVE plan could be abandoned

The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in Missouri is currently weighing whether the Biden administration can move forward with lowering monthly payments and forgiving loans through the SAVE income-driven repayment plan, while its legality is debated in a lower court. The Biden administration has committed to defending the plan, but it's unclear if the next Trump administration will follow suit. ""The reason [the Biden] administration is defending the rule so vigorously is it was providing a much more affordable repayment plan,"" Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Student Borrower Protection Center, tells CNBC Make It. A separate multi-state lawsuit also challenging provisions of the SAVE plan is currently with the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Kansas, but has taken a backseat to the Missouri case because a decision in Missouri could render the Kansas case null. It's a confusing back and forth with no clear end in sight, Yu says. When the dust does settle in one or both cases, it's not clear how student loan repayment would proceed. Millions of borrowers may not know what their monthly payment will be for the foreseeable future.

2. Student loan forgiveness could be stalled

During his first term in office, Trump proposed slashing funding to a variety of higher education programs and eliminating Public Service Loan Forgiveness, although the measure didn't pass. If he wants to completely eliminate existing forgiveness programs like PSLF or borrower defense to repayment, which helps those defrauded by their academic institutions, he will need Congressional support. However, debt relief could still be stalled if the administration manages it differently, Yu says, highlighting what happened during Trump's first term. Borrowers first started to become eligible for loan forgiveness through PSLF in 2017, a decade after Congress introduced the program. But as of 2019, roughly 99% of borrowers who applied for PSLF were rejected. In July of that year, one of the largest teachers unions in the country sued then-Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos over her mismanagement of the program. They settled in 2021. Similarly, the Trump administration loosened the rules for institutions to demonstrate successful outcomes for students, allowing it to deny an estimated $11 billion in debt relief to borrowers defrauded by programs like those at for-profit colleges. And like the SAVE plan, Biden's plan B for broad debt forgiveness is also currently tied up in court. The plan aims to provide debt relief to millions of borrowers who entered repayment decades ago, owed more than they initially borrowed or enrolled in low-value academic programs. While the Biden administration promised to keep defending it, it's unlikely the Trump administration will continue fighting the Republican-led lawsuits.

""The Chinese side is willing, on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, to increase communication with the U.S., expand cooperation and resolve differences,"" He Yongqian, spokesperson at China's Ministry of Commerce, told reporters Thursday in Mandarin, according to a CNBC translation.

She was responding to a question about China's views and planned countermeasures, given the potential for increased U.S. tariffs and restrictions on high-end tech.

""Together [we can] push China-U.S. economic and trade relations toward a stable, healthy and sustainable direction, for the benefit of both countries and the world,"" the commerce spokesperson said.

Her comments echoed those of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who earlier in the day noted the benefits of bilateral cooperation in a congratulatory message to Trump, according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs readout.",Nov 7 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/china-urges-us-cooperation-as-trump-trade-threat-looms.html

Current borrowers should remain entitled to relief

While the program remains in effect, borrowers are entitled to the relief, said Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit. ""Don't panic,"" Mayotte said. ""PSLF is written into federal law, by a Republican president, and it would take an act of Congress to eliminate it."" As of now, Republicans have a majority in the Senate. The House is still up for grabs, with several races too close to call. Yet even if both chambers are under GOP control, it's not clear ""all the Republicans want it gone,"" Mayotte said.

That means current borrowers would still be able to work toward loan forgiveness under the program. ""So, worst-case scenario, it would be for loans made on or after the date of such a law enactment,"" Mayotte said. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz agreed that's how such a change would probably play out. ""Most likely the change would apply only to new borrowers,"" Kantrowitz said.

"Mortgage rates surge higher on Trump victory, causing housing stocks to fall","President-elect Donald Trump's victory spurred a rise in in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield. Mortgage rates, which loosely follow the benchmark yield, are also climbing.

The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage surged 9 basis points Wednesday to 7.13%, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is the highest rate since July 1 of this year, though not quite the surge some had expected.

""The expectation among bond traders coming into the election was that rates would move higher in the event of a Trump victory and especially a red sweep. While the latter is not yet clear, the former is enough for another bump to rates that have already risen abruptly with Trump's victory odds,"" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.

Housing stocks reacted in turn, with both the big public builders and building material companies falling sharply. Lennar, D.R. Horton and PulteGroup were all down more than 4% in midday trading Wednesday. Retailers Home Depot and Lowe's also fell, more than 3% apiece.

""The builder stocks are highly sensitive to mortgage rates and mortgage rate expectations. Inflation expectations are higher now, which impacts long-term rates,"" said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

While Trump did not lay out a detailed housing plan, he did talk about deregulation and opening federal land for more home construction.

The National Association of Home Builders congratulated the president-elect with a statement from its chairman, Carl Harris, saying, ""NAHB looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration and leaders in Congress from both parties to enact a pro-housing legislative and regulatory agenda that increases the nation's housing supply and eases the nation's affordability woes.""

Big builders have been buying down mortgage rates for their customers, but that has been cutting into their margins.

Mortgage rates hit a recent low of 6.11% on Sept. 11, but have been rising steadily since, despite the recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Mortgage rates don't follow the Fed, but do react to the central bank's thinking on the economy. Stronger-than-expected economic reports in September and October caused bond yields, and consequently mortgage rates, to move higher.

To put it in perspective for consumers, a homebuyer purchasing a $400,000 home with a 20% down payment on a 30-year fixed mortgage, would have had a monthly payment of $1,941 in early September. Today that payment would be $2,157, a difference of $216.

Sales of existing homes have seen an unusual surge this fall. Pending sales, which represent signed contracts, rose 7% in September compared with August, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was before rates surged significantly higher.

The sales increase is largely due to more supply. There were 29.2% more homes actively for sale in October compared with October 2023, reaching the highest level of active inventory since December 2019, according to Realtor.com.

""The path ahead is anyone's guess and will ultimately be determined by inflation, the economy, and Treasury issuance,"" Graham added.",Nov 6 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/mortgage-rates-surge-on-trump-victory-housing-stocks-to-plummet.html
Treasury yields fall as investors brace for U.S. presidential election," The yield on 10-year Treasury fell more than six basis points to 4.295%. The yield on the 2-year Treasury dipped nearly three basis points to 4.176%.

U.S. Treasury yields were lower on Monday as investors braced for a busy week that will see voters head to the polls for the U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision.

The moves come a day ahead of federal elections in the United States, including for president. NBC News' final poll of the election shows a ""deadlocked"" race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

Control of Congress will also be closely watched by traders, as split power in Washington could make it harder for either presidential candidate to enact their policies.

Monday's rate moves partially reversed a back-up in yields on Friday, which came despite a weak jobs report. Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said on ""The Exchange"" that election positioning could be responsible for these swings in the fixed income market.

""Bonds just aren't acting like themselves,"" Roland said.

Investors are also focused on the Fed's interest rate decision at the central bank's policy meeting on Thursday. The decision will be followed by comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which could provide hints about the Fed's expectations for the economy and interest rates for the coming months.

""The 10-year UST yield has risen several weeks and is testing downtrend resistance at 4.35%. The FOMC is expected to cut rates on Thursday, and we expect yields to decline below 4% by year-end eventually,"" Piper Sandler chief market technician Craig Johnson said in a note to clients.

Traders were last pricing in a 98% chance of a quarter-point interest rate cut, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. This follows the Fed's 50 basis point jumbo rate cut in September.

On the economic front, factory orders for September fell 0.5%, the Census Bureau said Monday. That matched economists' expectations, according to Dow Jones. The latest PMI, or purchasing managers index, is due out on Tuesday.

"AI chatbots aren't reliable for voting information, government officials warn","New York Attorney General Letitia James speaks during a press conference at the Office of the Attorney General in New York on February 16, 2024.

With four days until the presidential election, U.S. government officials are cautioning against reliance on artificial intelligence chatbots for voting-related information.

In a consumer alert on Friday, the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James said it had tested ""multiple AI-powered chatbots by posing sample questions about voting and found that they frequently provided inaccurate information in response.""

Election Day in the U.S. is Tuesday, and Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris are locked in a virtual dead heat.

""New Yorkers who rely on chatbots, rather than official government sources, to answer their questions about voting, risk being misinformed and could even lose their opportunity to vote due to the inaccurate information,"" James' office said.

It's a major year for political campaigns worldwide, with elections taking place that affect upward of 4 billion people in more than 40 countries. The rise of AI-generated content has led to serious election-related misinformation concerns.

The number of deepfakes has increased 900% year over year, according to data from Clarity, a machine learning firm. Some included videos that were created or paid for by Russians seeking to disrupt the U.S. elections, U.S. intelligence officials say.

Lawmakers are particularly concerns about misinformation in the age of generative AI, which took off in late 2022 with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Large language models are still new and routinely spit out inaccurate and unreliable information.

""Voters categorically should not look to AI chatbots for information about voting or the election — there are far too many concerns about accuracy and completeness,"" Alexandra Reeve Givens, CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, told CNBC. ""Study after study has shown examples of AI chatbots hallucinating information about polling locations, accessibility of voting and permissible ways to cast your vote.""

In a July study, the Center for Democracy & Technology found that in response to 77 different election-related queries, more than one-third of answers generated by AI chatbots included incorrect information. The study tested chatbots from Mistral, Google , OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta .

""We agree with the NY Attorney General that voters should consult official channels to understand where, when, and how to vote,"" an Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC. ""For specific election and voting information, we direct users to authoritative sources as Claude is not trained frequently enough to provide real-time information about specific elections.""

OpenAI said in a recent blog post that, ""Starting on November 5th, people who ask ChatGPT about election results will see a message encouraging them to check news sources like the Associated Press? and Reuters?, or their state or local election board for the most complete and up-to-date information.""

In a 54-page report published last month, OpenAI said that it's disrupted ""more than 20 operations and deceptive networks from around the world that attempted to use our models."" The threats ranged from AI-generated website articles to social media posts by fake accounts, the company wrote, though none of the election-related operations were able to attract ""viral engagement.""

The potential that Donald Trump could prevail in the presidential race has contributed to sentiment in financial markets that the firebrand candidate's policies could stir both economic growth as well as inflation. In the case that Donald Trump defeats Kamala Harris, some see a scenario in which rising fiscal deficits, along with a potential global trade war, could mean higher inflation and surging bond yields, along with gains in the stock market. Follow: Election 2024 live updates: Trump and Harris await Presidential election results Being that yields and prices move in the opposite direction, that would be bad for underlying fixed income value. Depending on how things trend, there's even talk about the return of ""bond vigilantes"" — traders who essentially force the government's hands by either eschewing government debt or selling it outright. Investor Ed Yardeni coined the term back in the 1980s, and cautioned that the vigilantes could return. Specifically, he warned about traders taking the 10-year Treasury yield , a bond market benchmark, above 5% — a level it hasn't seen since mid-2007. ""We aren't (yet) calling for the 10-year Treasury yield to reach 5%, but the Bond Vigilantes seem to be threatening to take it there,"" Yardeni wrote in Monday commentary.

What's happening in bonds?

To be sure, there are myriad reasons why the bond market has been in a state of tumult since mid-September, political considerations of a second Trump term being just one of them. Consider: The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark short-term borrowing rate by half a percentage point on Sept. 18. While that might normally trigger the rest of the yield structure to move lower, it instead kindled expectations of more robust economic growth and, in some quarters, worries over inflation stoked by easier monetary policy.

Fiscal 2024 just ended with the government running a budget deficit in excess of $1.8 trillion, including more than $1.1 trillion dedicated solely to paying financing costs on the $36 trillion U.S. debt.

Neither Trump nor Harris are even discussing fiscal discipline, raising worries that investors will demand higher yields in exchange for holding Treasury paper that suddenly doesn't look so safe. In fact, Yardeni sees the fiscal and Fed factors as joint culprits. The central bank is widely expected to approve another quarter percentage point cut when it meets Thursday. ""Investors often hear 'Don't fight the Fed,' but perhaps it's the Fed that shouldn't be fighting the Bond Vigilantes,"" the head of Yardeni Research said. ""The bond market could easily nullify the impacts of another rate cut. That's because the bond market believes the Fed is cutting rates by too much, too soon, and is therefore raising long-term inflation expectations. These expectations are heightened by concerns about more fiscal excesses from the next administration."" ""Bonds are indicating that the continuation of large fiscal deficits in a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump presidency, and the lack of discipline in monetary policy, warrant a much higher yield,"" added Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies. ""The Federal Reserve can ignore the signal at its own peril."" Harris has been part of an administration in which fiscal largesse, combined with pandemic-related supply and demand factors, led to the highest inflation rate in more than 40 years. However, it's Trump's proposals that have gotten intensified focus lately as online betting sites have raised the odds that he could be elected to another term, despite polls showing a neck-and-neck race.

A study sees trouble

A report from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank, painted a more dour picture for the nation's fiscal and economic health as well as for inflation under a Trump presidency. Author Karen Dynan charged that Trump's stated intentions to ramp up tariffs and deportations, along with reports that he could seek greater authority over the Federal Reserve, would result ""in lower US national income, lower employment, and higher inflation than otherwise."" ""In some cases, economic conditions recover over time, but in others the damage continues through 2040,"" the report continued. ""And despite Trump's 'America first' rhetoric, these policies would harm the US economy more than any other in the world, particularly trade-exposed sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture. In some cases, other countries would enjoy stronger economic growth than otherwise after receiving inflows of capital leaving the United States."" The institute has been comparatively quiet about implications for a Harris presidency. A recent working paper said the Democrat's policies likely would leave baseline forecasts in place because of expected ""limited changes to current policies on immigration, trade, and Fed independence."" Other voices on Wall Street have issued inflationary warnings about Trump's policies, though in muted tones relative to the Peterson narrative, which estimated potential inflation under Trump as up to 7.4 percentage points above normal in a Trump presidency. Morgan Stanley, for instance, recently predicted that tariffs and other isolationist policies under Trump could shave 1.4% off real economic growth and raise headline inflation rates by 0.9%. Similarly, JPMorgan warned that a ""red sweep"" for Republicans is the ""biggest tail risk"" from the election. It could carry ""higher tariffs and mass deportations, which triggers stagflation in the US including a second inflation spike,"" the bank said. However, the firm also noted that ""Trump has shown a willingness to change his views"" and the aforementioned ""tail risk is not priced-into markets nor is it actively discussed across the US client base.""",Nov 4 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/04/as-the-election-winds-down-worries-of-bond-vigilantes-and-inflation-hit-markets.html 
"Biden forgives more student loans: 60,000 borrowers will get notices canceling $4.5 billion in debt","The Biden administration announced Thursday that it was forgiving another $4.5 billion in student debt for more than 60,000 borrowers.

The latest round of relief is a result of the U.S. Department of Education's fixes to the popular, but once troubled, Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

President Joe Biden, who has forgiven more education debt than any other president in U.S history, said that the number of borrowers to benefit from the program under his administration now exceeded 1 million.

""Public service workers – teachers, nurses, firefighters, and more – are the bedrocks of our communities and our country,"" Biden said in a statement. ""But for too long, the government failed to live up to its commitments.""

The PSLF program, signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007, allows certain not-for-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years. In 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimated that one-quarter of American workers may be eligible.

However, the program was plagued by problems. Often, borrowers believed they were on track to loan cancellation only to discover at some point that they didn't qualify on a technicality, such as their loan type or repayment plan.

Before Biden took office, only 7,000 people had ever received the debt relief under PSLF, the Department of Education said. The program's rejection rate was as high as 98% in some years, it added.

Under Biden, the Education Department has relaxed the program's requirements and overhauled how it's managed.",Oct 17 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/17/student-loan-forgiveness-biden-public-service-debt.html
Trump criminal election case paused as special counsel Jack Smith weighs fate of prosecution,"Special counsel Jack Smith makes a statement to reporters about the 37 federal charges returned by a grand jury in an indictment of former U.S. President Donald Trump on charges of unauthorized retention of classified documents and conspiracy to obstruct justice as Smith speaks at his offices in Washington, U.S. June 9, 2023.

A judge on Friday paused proceedings in the criminal election interference case against President-elect Donald Trump, a move that reflects the expected end of the prosecution.

The pause was requested by special counsel Jack Smith, whose team is prosecuting Trump in federal court in Washington, D.C.

Smith earlier Friday told Judge Tanya Chutkan that vacating the schedule of remaining pretrial deadlines would give his team ""time to assess this unprecedented circumstance"" of Trump's electoral victory ""and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy.""

""By December 2, 2024, the Government will file a status report or otherwise inform the Court of the result of its deliberations,"" Smith wrote in a filing Friday.

Chutkan endorsed that deadline in her order vacating the other deadlines.

Trump's win against Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this week was considered a death knell for Smith's prosecutions of him.

On Wednesday, NBC News reported that DOJ officials have been evaluating how to wind down the election case and another criminal case against Trump before he is sworn in as president.

Trump has said he plans to fire Smith, and is expected to force the DOJ to end the prosecutions.

The next U.S. president could face a tax battle in 2025 — here's what it means for investors,"This combination of pictures created on October 25, 2024 shows US Vice-President and Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris in Houston, Texas on October 25, 2024 and former US President Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in East Del Valle, Austin, Texas on October 25, 2024.

A Pennsylvania federal judge on Friday returned to state court a lawsuit against billionaire Elon Musk and his political action committee over their $1 million daily giveaway to registered voters.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner's request to block Musk and his America PAC from awarding any more prizes to voters in Pennsylvania will be heard Monday morning by a judge in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, according to a docket entry.

A hearing on Krasner's request began in that state court Thursday morning. But the hearing soon ended after a judge there said Musk's removal of the case to federal court prevented any action in the state court.

Krasner accuses Musk and the PAC of operating an illegal lottery and of trying to influence voters in the presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.

Musk and the PAC, who are backing Trump, also are accused in the suit of violating state consumer protection laws.

U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert in his ruling Friday returning the case to the Court of Common Pleas dismissed arguments by Musk's lawyers that the suit should be handled in Philadelphia federal court because it references the upcoming presidential election.

""But federal question jurisdiction does not turn on a plaintiff's motivations in filing suit; it turns on whether the legal issues arising from the claims originate in federal or state law,"" wrote Pappert, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.

Pappert said the defendants had not identified ""any question of federal law"" that must be resolved in the DA's favor ""in order to prove either state-law claim.""",Nov 1 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/elon-musk-1-million-voter-lottery-suit-sent-back-to-state-court.html
Harris PAC's $1 million contribution from Ripple's Chris Larsen shows crypto industry warming to VP,"SAN FRANCISCO — For months, crypto companies and their executives have been pouring tens of millions of dollars into Donald Trump's effort to win the White House. Chris Larsen isn't one of them. The co-founder and chairman of Ripple recently contributed $1 million worth of XRP tokens, the currency created by Ripple in 2012, to Future Forward, a super PAC that's supporting Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. Larsen, who's backed candidates across the aisle for the last few years, told CNBC in an interview on Monday that his comfort level with Harris comes from conversations he's had with people inside the campaign and what he's seen from the vice president since she replaced President Biden at the top of the ticket in July. It helps that Harris is from the Bay Area. ""She knows people who have grown up in the innovation economy her whole life,"" Larsen said. ""So I think she gets it at a fundamental level, in a way that I think the Biden folks were just not paying attention to, or maybe just didn't make the connection between empowering workers and making sure you have American champions dominating their industries."" Larsen's affection for the Democratic nominee isn't brand new. In February, he gave the maximum personal contribution of $6,600 to Harris (which would cover the primary and general election), about five months before she became the Democratic presidential nominee, FEC filings show. At the same time, he contributed $100,000 to the Harris Action Fund PAC. In total, Larsen has given around $1.9 million to support Harris' campaign directly and through PACs, according to FEC data compiled by crypto market and blockchain analyst James Delmore and independently verified by CNBC. Larsen, 64, has a net worth of $3.1 billion, according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership of XRP and involvement in Ripple, which provides blockchain technology for financial services companies. He's part of an industry that's become suddenly prominent in political fundraising, though more heavily in support of Republicans. Nearly half of all the corporate money flowing into the election has come from the crypto industry, according to a recent report from the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen.

The sum was raised from a mix of contributors, with Coinbase, Ripple, and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz accounting for most of those business donations. The industry has raised roughly 13 times the amount it brought in during the last presidential election year. Close to two-thirds of crypto contributions have gone either to supporting Republicans or opposing Democrats, according to Delmore's compilation of FEC data. Trump has received more than $4 million in virtual tokens, an FEC filing shows, and in July, the ex-president keynoted a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee.

'More pragmatic approach'

Larsen's recent contributions include $1 million to Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro in December, and almost $7,000 in February to John Deaton, the Massachusetts Republican who's taking on Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a vocal crypto critic. He also donated $250,000 in 2022 to the Nancy Pelosi Victory Fund and contributed to a pro-Biden PAC in 2020. Larsen told CNBC that he's ""really confident"" that Harris will bring a ""more pragmatic approach and clear rules"" to the crypto industry, in contrast to the current situation with Gary Gensler running the SEC. Gensler's open hostility towards much of the crypto industry and his aggressive crackdowns on companies, including Ripple, is a big reason why many in the space say they're supporting Trump. In January, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who has also donated to members of both parties, called Gensler a ""political liability."" ""What we've had to date has been almost like purposeful chaos by Gensler to kind of crush the domestic industry,"" Larsen said. That ""has only empowered sketchier foreign operations. It just doesn't make any sense,"" he said, adding that ""Gensler must be the most unpopular person in Washington, D.C."" CNBC reached out to Gensler's office for comment and didn't hear back. Ripple's legal chief said in June that the company has spent over $100 million on litigation to defend itself against civil charges brought by the SEC. In 2020, before Biden took office, the SEC accused Ripple, Garlinghouse and Larsen of violating securities laws by acting as unregistered brokers of digital currency tokens, which the SEC regulates as securities. The SEC later dismissed the charges against the two Ripple executives, and the company has denied it broke securities laws. They remain in active litigation. Earlier this month, the agency filed a notice of appeal in its multi-year case with the Ripple. Ripple has given about $50 million to the pro-crypto super PAC Fairshake, which has been contributing to candidates up and down the ballot, and on both sides of the aisle.

Harris has been gaining momentum within the crypto community. Two days after Biden dropped out of the race, Marvin Ammori, legal chief at decentralized exchange Uniswap, gave money to the Harris Action Fund. Uniswap is also battling claims it violated U.S. securities laws. Skybridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci, who spent 11 days as White House communications director under Trump, has given more than $36,000 to two PACs supporting the Democratic nominee. Scaramucci says he's among a group of crypto advocates working with Harris to develop her campaign's policies on digital assets and to help the vice president distance the Democrats from Sen. Warren. And then there's venture capitalist Ben Horowitz, who maintains a sizable portfolio of crypto companies. The Andreessen Horowitz co-founder and his partner Marc Andreessen said in July they were planning to make significant donations to PACs supporting Trump's run for president due to what they characterized as his friendliness to the ""little tech agenda."" That was when Biden was the nominee. By early October, Horowitz appeared to have had a change of heart. He told employees at his firm that he would be making a ""significant"" personal contribution to Harris' election bid. Horowitz said that he and his wife, Felicia, ""have known Vice President Harris for over 10 years and she has been a great friend to both of us during that time."" A couple weeks earlier, in late September, Harris finally gave a nod to cryptocurrency in a public address. ""We will encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting our consumers and investors,"" she said at a $27 million fundraiser in New York. On Monday, the Harris campaign unveiled its ""Opportunity Agenda for Black Men"" in a report. The plan explicitly mentions creating a framework for cryptocurrency in the U.S. designed to safeguard those assets. The campaign said more than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned digital currencies. Despite Larsen's track record of donating to Democrats, he took heat on social media after his latest contribution was reported on CNBC on Friday. ""The Ripple community and even the crypto community in general has a lot of skepticism toward Kamala's candidacy and what policies she would put into place,"" Delmore said, reflecting much of the online sentiment Larsen blew off the criticism, and said he doesn't pay attention to social media.

"Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by Inauguration Day, says crypto expert—what a Trump Presidency could mean for digital assets","The price of bitcoin rose above $90,000 for the first time this week, as investors continued to bid up cryptocurrency prices in the wake of the 2024 election.

In the runup to the vote, analysts touted President-elect Trump as the more crypto-friendly candidate who had promised on the campaign trail to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and a ""bitcoin superpower.""

In a September note, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick predicted a crypto breakout in the event of either candidate winning — but with a much higher target for a Trump victory.

All told, bitcoin, the largest and most widely traded cryptocurrency, has risen 30% since election night, and crypto experts say there could be more room to run in the near term.

""The next price target we're looking at is the $100,000 mark,"" says Federico Brokate, vice president and head of U.S. business at crypto ETF firm 21Shares. ""We think we could reasonably reach that by, quite frankly, Inauguration Day.""

Part of crypto's upward price momentum stems from investor optimism in what a Republican-controlled government could mean for digital assets, Brokate says. But the long-term outlook for crypto would have been the same regardless of who took office.

BAKU, Azerbaijan — Dubbed the ""climate financing COP,"" the 29th iteration of the U.N.'s annual climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, has hosted talks focused on unlocking crucial funds to combat environmental change — and on the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's sweeping win last week in the U.S. elections.

The U.S. plays a really critical role as an engine for the global economy, a driver of new technology, a source of finance,"" Rich Lesser, global chair of the Boston Consulting Group, told CNBC's Dan Murphy in Baku.

""President Trump has been very clear he doesn't believe in climate change. I think he's used the word that it's a hoax and that he would take a much more aggressive stand to building out fossil fuel infrastructure in the U.S., and a much more restrictive view of how to deploy investment into decarbonization,"" Lesser added. The new balance of power in Washington could lead to a rollback of many climate-linked reforms passed by the administration of incumbent Joe Biden. While campaigning, Trump targeted the Inflation Reduction Act — which he calls the ""green new scam"" — and pledged to rescind any ""unspent"" funds. U.S. climate envoy John Podesta, who leads America's delegation at COP29, held firm on Washington's continued leadership on climate policy, saying during the opening of the annual conference that ""efforts to prevent climate change remain a commitment in the U.S. and will confidently continue."" World Bank President Ajay Banga was also upbeat over the incoming administration, telling CNBC that ""my experience with President Donald Trump in his first term was that he listens to practical reason, no spin. Give him the facts and let him take his own judgment."" He added, ""What I'm going to tell him is what I'm trying to do, which I think transcends any administration — which is, make the place work better, make it work faster, make it more efficient, make it work as a better partner with the other national development banks. Get the private sector in and drive that and make sure you drive jobs.""

Trump has also vowed to once more withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, a 2015 pact in which nearly 200 governments made non-binding pledges to reduce emissions. Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods warned against the exit, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. ""I would encourage them to stay in the Paris Agreement,"" Woods told CNBC, adding that Trump can instead bring a ""common sense approach,"" to reducing emissions — a task the Exxon Mobil head said needs a global framework.

Trump has made hydrocarbons a key point of his campaigning agenda, previously vowing to ""unleash American Energy"" and promising to end Biden's ""delays in federal drilling permits and leases that are needed to unleash American oil and natural gas production."" In his speech at the Republican National Convention in July, Trump claimed that increasing domestic oil and gas production would drive down prices for consumers at the pump. Under the Biden government, U.S. crude production averaged 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, breaking the previous national and global record of 12.3 million b/d, set in 2019 during Trump's first presidential term, according to the EIA.",Nov 13 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/cop28-leaders-weigh-us-role-in-climate-policy-after-trump-win.html
Ex-Trump fixer Michael Cohen faces long odds in reviving claim against former boss,"Michael Cohen, former attorney for former U.S. President Donald Trump, arrives to the New York Courthouse in New York City, U.S., March 13, 2023.

WASHINGTON — Michael Cohen is an unlikely civil rights warrior.

The disgraced and disbarred lawyer enjoys fame of the notorious variety because of his longtime association with Donald Trump.

That relationship ended in a spectacular falling out. He ended up serving a three-year sentence on various charges he pleaded guilty to relating to the work he had carried out for Trump.

Where Cohen, now a voluble Trump critic, aligns with civil rights advocates is on trying to turn the tide on the Supreme Court's hostility to claims against federal officials for constitutional violations.

Cohen is making a last-ditch effort to revive a lawsuit alleging that Trump sent him back to prison — ending a home confinement arrangement — in retaliation for writing a tell-all book. His appeal, now pending at the court, urges the justices to reverse course.

The justices are scheduled to discuss whether to hear his case at their regular private meeting on Oct. 18.

In an interview via Zoom, Cohen couched his case both in terms of the broader legal issue — seeking to deter officials from taking unconstitutional actions — and the more specific aim of clipping Trump's wings, with the possibility of a second term in office if the Republican nominee wins November's election.

""Understanding and knowing Donald Trump, based upon his own words, if there isn't a significant deterrent factor, he will not stop,"" Cohen said. ""It won't stop with just locking people up.""

He noted Trump had previously suggested that Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump, should be executed for treason.

""If there is no deterrent factor to somebody who lacks a moral compass, what do you end up with? A monarch? A king? A dictator? A führer?"" Cohen said.

Cohen was held in solitary confinement for 16 days after refusing to sign a form that would have prevented him from speaking to the press or posting on social media. He was released when a federal judge ruled that the government had retaliated against him for his wish to exercise his free speech rights by writing the book and speaking about it.

Cohen then filed a civil rights lawsuit against Trump, former Attorney General William Barr and other officials seeking damages for, among other things, a violation of his right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.

The Supreme Court only takes up a tiny number of appeals, and even Cohen's lawyer, Jon-Michael Dougherty, conceded his client has ""an uphill battle.""

That is because the court in recent years has made it increasingly hard to bring civil rights claims against federal officials under a 1971 precedent called Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.

Most recently, in a 2022 case called Egbert v. Boule, the court effectively put ""Bivens claims"" on life support in a ruling that tossed out claims against a Border Patrol agent.

The decision was widely condemned by lawyers on the left and right who support holding government officials accountable.

Cohen's Supreme Court filing ""actually does do a very good job of illustrating how blatantly federal officials can get away with violating the Constitution when Bivens has been reduced to nothing, or maybe something very close to nothing,"" said Patrick Jaicomo, a lawyer with the libertarian-leaning Institute for Justice.

As NBC News reported last year, the 2022 Egbert ruling has been cited hundreds of times by lower court judges when throwing out Bivens claims in cases raising all manner of constitutional claims, whether it be excessive force allegations against federal law enforcement or medical indifference claims against officers in federal prisons.

Cohen's own case was no exception.

A federal judge in New York and the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals both cited the Egbert ruling in throwing out Cohen's claims.

Cohen also faces an unlikely alliance opposing his request: Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The current president's Justice Department has filed a brief agreeing with the former president that the Supreme Court should not get involved.

Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, on behalf of the Biden administration, pointed out among other things that Cohen had effectively got what he wanted when the judge ordered him to be released from prison.

In Trump's brief, his lawyer Alina Habba wrote that lower courts ""faithfully applied"" Supreme Court precedent in ruling against Cohen.

Even in the unlikely event that Cohen's case was allowed to move forward, Habba, who did not respond to a request seeking further comment, wrote that Trump would claim immunity from suit, based on a 1978 Supreme Court ruling that protects presidents facing civil claims for actions taken in office.

The court relied in part on the reasoning of that ruling when it found in July that Trump had some immunity in the criminal case brought against him over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

With the chances of victory appearing slight, Cohen painted the case in stark terms, comparing his experience to that of critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin who have been imprisoned for expressing their opposition to the government.

Mark Cuban mocks Trump's tariff ideas at Harris campaign rally as Elon Musk tours PA with pro-Trump PAC,"Mark Cuban speaks at a campaign rally for Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris at the University of Wisconsin La Crosse, in La Crosse, Wis., Thursday, Oct. 17, 2024.

Mark Cuban mocked Donald Trump on Thursday over his sweeping tariff proposals, suggesting the Republican presidential nominee doesn't understand his own tax ideas.

""I've learned a lot about business, including how tariffs work,"" the billionaire investor and former ""Shark Tank"" host told supporters of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris at a campaign rally in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

Trump ""thinks that China pays for them,"" Cuban said of the proposal to hike taxes on all imported goods from China up to 60% or higher.

""This is same guy that thought that Mexico would pay for the wall,"" Cuban quipped, prompting laughter and cheers from the crowd.

Trump has repeatedly pointed to tariffs as a sort of cure-all, arguing that heavy import taxes — including an across-the-board tariff as high as 20% — will bring in massive revenue from overseas, fund a slew of tax cuts and boost U.S. industries, all without causing inflation.

But U.S. importers are the ones who directly pay those tariffs to the government, and mainstream economists say enacting Trump's plans would raise costs on Americans. The Peterson Institute for International Economics, for instance, found that a universal 20% tariff and a 60% tariff on China would cost the typical U.S. household more than $2,600 per year.

Cuban added that he believes Trump ""used to understand how tariffs work"" back in the 1990s and 2000s.

""But I don't know what happened to him,"" Cuban said.

The Wisconsin appearance marked the first of three swing states Cuban is visiting in support of the vice president's White House bid.

Cuban is set to head to Phoenix, Arizona, on Saturday to host a talk about Harris' economic agenda, according to the Harris campaign. On Sunday, he will campaign with second gentleman Douglas Emhoff in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Liberty Energy is an oilfield services company headquartered in Denver with a $2.7 billion market capitalization. The company's stock gained nearly 9% on Nov. 6 after Trump won the U.S. presidential election, but its shares have since pulled back.

Wright serves on the board of Oklo , a nuclear power startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that is developing micro reactors.

Wright will also serve on Trump's Council of National Energy, the president-elect said Saturday. The council will be led by Trump's pick for Interior Secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.

Wright has denied that climate change presents a global crisis that needs to be addressed through a transition away from fossil fuels.

""There is no climate crisis and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,"" Wright said in a video posted on his LinkedIn page last year. ""Humans and all complex life on earth is simply impossible without carbon dioxide. Hence the term carbon pollution is outrageous.""

""There is no such thing as clean energy or dirty energy,"" Wright said. ""All energy sources have impacts on the world both positive and negative.""

Trump described Wright as a ""leading technologist and entrepreneur in the energy sector.""

""He has worked in Nuclear, Solar, Geothermal, and Oil and Gas,"" the president-elect said in a statement Saturday.

""Most significantly, Chris was one of the pioneers who helped launch the American Shale Revolution that fueled American Energy Independence, and transformed the Global Energy Markets and Geopolitics,"" Trump said.

Trump has vowed to increase fossil fuel production to reduce energy costs, though analysts and some oil executives have said the president has little influence on oil and natural gas output in the U.S.

The U.S. has produced more crude oil than any other country in history, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, since 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration.",Nov 16 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/16/trump-picks-liberty-energy-ceo-and-oklo-board-member-chris-wright-as-energy-secretary.html

Kamala Harris: This morning routine helps me work 15 hours a day—'no matter how little sleep I get',"Kamala Harris credits her ability to power through 90-hour workweeks, at least partially, to her consistent morning routine.

Harris, the current U.S. vice president and Democratic nominee for president, kicks off each day with two staples: a balanced breakfast and a workout, she told ex-NFL star Shannon Sharpe's ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast on Monday.

""I'm having, I probably estimate, 14 hour, 15 hour days,"" said Harris, who's appeared on a variety of popular podcasts in the runup to Election Day on November 5. ""No matter how little sleep or how much sleep I've had, I work out every morning ... You know, mind, body and spirit. That's the only time of day I really own.""

As recently as 2018, Harris did elliptical workouts or 30-minute SoulCycle sessions, and her breakfasts featured generic, low-sugar Raisin Bran and tea with lemon, she told New York Magazine. Now, she prefers a spinach omelet, chicken apple sausage and toast. ""Then I'm gone,"" she told Sharpe.

DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to negotiating a higher salary

Harris didn't always think she needed breakfast, but the simple routine helps her prepare for her bustling workdays, she added: ""These days, it's not unusual for me to be in three or even four cities in one day. Rallies with thousands of people ... Making calls to folks.""

Skipping breakfast long-term can negatively impact your mood and sleep quality, studies show. People in communities with the highest life expectancies, also known as ""blue zones,"" also make breakfast a priority, longevity researcher Dan Buettner told Make It in 2018.

""As they say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day,"" said Buettner. ""It gives your body the energy to make it through the day and can be an opportunity to get a lot of healthy foods into your body to start the day.""

Harris seems to like consistency, from following the same routine every morning to starting all her meetings the same way: on time.

""It's really important to me to be on time,"" she told leadership researcher Brené Brown's ""Unlocking Us"" podcast on Monday. ""I've never seen an elected leader who is always on time, but I feel that I owe other people the respect of knowing their time is important.""

"Bitcoin tops $89,000 as crypto euphoria over Trump win shows no sign of waning","Bitcoin hit another high Monday, as the rally in cryptocurrencies continued following Donald Trump's election win. The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by more than 12% at $89,174, according to Coin Metrics. Recently, it hit a fresh high of $89,623. Ether was up more than 7% to $3,371.79 after a 30% gain in the past week that pushed it back over the $3,000 mark over the weekend. The decentralized finance token tied to Cardano ticked 4.7% higher. Dogecoin continued to rise, up almost 24%. In the regular trading session on Monday, Coinbase closed up 19.8%, while MicroStrategy advanced more than 25.7%.

Vaccine maker stocks fall as Trump chooses RFK Jr. to lead HHS," Shares of vaccine makers fell Thursday as President-elect Donald Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

The stocks fell in the final hour of trading as reports emerged about Trump's expected pick. Moderna 's stock closed more than 5% lower on Thursday, shares of Novavax fell more than 7% and Pfizer 's stock ended more than 2% lower.

Shares of BioNTech , the German drugmaker that helped develop a Covid vaccine with Pfizer, closed more than 6% lower. British drugmaker GSK , which makes flu shots and several other vaccines, closed roughly 2% lower.

Shares of those companies dipped further in extended trading as Trump confirmed his pick in a post on his platform Truth Social.

Health policy experts have said a second Trump term could allow Kennedy to elevate anti-vaccine rhetoric, which could deter more Americans from receiving Covid shots and routine immunizations that have for decades saved millions of lives and prevented debilitating illnesses.

Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are still recovering from falling Covid vaccination rates in the U.S., which have dented their profits over the past two years.

Kennedy's track record as a vaccine skeptic is extensive. He has long made misleading and false statements about the safety of shots, such as claiming they are linked to autism despite numerous studies going back decades that debunk the association.

Kennedy is the founder of the nonprofit Children's Health Defense, the most well-funded anti-vaccine organization in the country.",Nov 14 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/14/vaccine-maker-stocks-fall-as-trump-chooses-rfk-jr-to-lead-hhs.html
Top hedge fund sounds inflation alarm as Trump may run U.S. economy 'as hot as possible',"Greenlight Capital president David Einhorn said the election results were good in terms of avoiding the issues of political stability that he was worried about not long ago, but for the economy, there is a much bigger problem coming as a result of what he expects from Donald Trump's second-term policies: higher inflation.

""We have increased our bets on inflation,"" he told CNBC's Leslie Picker at CNBC's Delivering Alpha investor summit on Wednesday. ""We will have another inflection up in inflation,"" he said. ""The policy mix being proposed is inflationary and we will see more of that over the next few years.""

Einhorn forecast inflation may be headed back to 3.5% to 4.5%, but not back to the 7% to 9% level that was the worst in four decades for the U.S. economy.

The latest CPI data released Wednesday showed inflation in line with market expectations, at 2.6%. The latest wholesale inflation data, reported Thursday, was also in line with expectations.

Einhorn's concerns come from all the tax cuts Trump would like to make, and even if he does not pursue them all, or Congress refuses to pass them all, the combination of some tax cuts in a strong economy with wage growth — and an immigration policy that will be inflationary in terms of cost and labor — will lead to ""a bunch of inflation.""

""What they chose to do about that, I don't know. There is an argument for tolerating it and trying to run the economy as hot as possible. I don't really know what they will do,"" he said.

Einhorn said he isn't bearish on the stock market even though he has recently talked about how expensive he thinks the market is and considers himself to be among the last value investors left in a ""broken market,"" comparing himself to the Maytag repairman at Delivering Alpha and revealing a bet on a beaten-up agricultural stock that he thinks is among the only bargains left in the market.

Trian Partners CEO and billionaire investor Nelson Peltz said at Delivering Alpha that while he is happy Trump won and viewed a potential Harris administration as a disaster, the rally can't last and extreme concentration in the market among a top-heavy group of high-momentum stocks is a factor. ""You've got two different markets. … You've got these 20 companies that are swinging the cat around the room. And then you've got these other companies,"" he said.

While bond yields have been under unexpected pressure in a Fed rate-cutting environment, Einhorn said the bond market has not yet begun to price in what will be a ""difficult Treasury [bond yield] situation,"" as a result of his concerns including expansionary economic policy under Trump.

This specific concern was cited at Delivering Alpha by Anne Walsh, Guggenheim Partners Investment Management chief investment officer, who expects bond yields to remain under pressure and the bond market to experience higher volatility than stocks for as long as a few years due to concerns about tax cuts and deficit spending, among other factors.",Nov 14 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/14/david-einhorn-increased-bets-on-inflation-trumps-election.html
"Space stocks saw big gains this week in part due to 'Trump-Elon trade' rally, analysts say","This past week saw several pure-play space stocks rally, with leaders up as much as 20% or more, in part driven by what sector analysts said is a ""Trump-Elon trade,"" a nod to the relationship between President-elect Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

""I don't think anyone can underplay the potential catalyst that I don't think many people were talking about before: the most important human in the history of the space industry having the ear of the president-elect, who in his past term found space important enough to create a separate branch of the military,"" Andrew Chanin, CEO of ProcureAM, which runs the UFO space-focused ETF, told CNBC.

Just this week saw Rocket Lab up 41%, Intuitive Machines up 28%, Spire Global up 26%, Planet Labs up 16%, Redwire up 15% and AST SpaceMobile up 10%.

Those gains were partly catalyzed by third-quarter results and individual updates, such as Rocket Lab's progress on Neutron and Spire's sale of its maritime business to remove debt.

But there is a broader market sentiment that is driving these stocks, too, said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard, who has buy ratings on Rocket Lab, Redwire and Intuitive Machines.

""I think there's definitely a risk-on, post-Trump-win rally that's being reflected in this industry,"" Sheppard told CNBC.

Back out even further to take a year-to-date perspective, and this week's top-performing space stocks have broken out of a post-SPAC malaise to triple or even quadruple in 2024.

""Space has been one of the best outperformers in the market this year for a handful of these names,"" Sheppard said.

""We're seeing a big increase in investor inbounds,"" he continued. ""We're getting calls and emails from institutional investors, which are finally starting to realize that this market is only going to continue to accelerate. It's only going to continue to proliferate because of national security, because of the Artemis program to get the U.S. astronauts back on the moon, because of Elon [Musk]'s ambitious goals of getting to Mars.""",Nov 15 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/space-stocks-rally-trump-elon-trade.html
Trump calls election case Judge Tanya Chuktan 'the most evil person',"Donald Trump on Friday called the judge presiding over his criminal election interference case in Washington, D.C., ""the most evil person"" for ordering the release of nearly 1,900 pages of previously sealed documents filed by prosecutors.

Trump suggested U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan made the files public to harm the Republican presidential nominee's chances in November's election.

""Now, it's a terrible thing, what's happening, and the judge is, this judge is the most evil person,"" Trump said on Dan Bongino's podcast.

""What judge would say, 'We're going to release something, you know, a couple of days before?'"" the former president asked.

Trump said ""it's not even believable"" that Chutkan had made public the filings by special counsel Jack Smith, whom he called ""a sick puppy.""

""They're going to release something else, and always before the election,"" Trump said. ""You know, they want to do it before the election. So election interference.""

Supreme Court rejects Michael Cohen's civil rights claim against Trump,"In this courtroom sketch, Michael Cohen looks toward former U.S. President Donald Trump as he is questioned by a lawyer for the attorney general's office, during the Trump Organization civil fraud trial in New York State Supreme Court in the Manhattan borough of New York City on Oct. 24, 2023.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday rejected disbarred lawyer Michael Cohen's last-ditch effort to revive a civil rights claim against his former boss Donald Trump.

The justices left in place lower court rulings that said Cohen could not pursue his allegation that then-President Trump and other officials violated his rights by putting him in solitary confinement for writing a tell-all book.

At the time of the 2020 incident, Cohen was serving a three-year sentence on various charges relating to the work he carried out for Trump.

He had been in home confinement because of the Covid-19 pandemic but was ordered back to prison after refusing to sign a form that would have prevented him from speaking to the press or posting on social media.

After 16 days in solitary confinement, a federal judge ordered Cohen released, finding that officials had retaliated against him on free speech grounds.

Cohen then sued Trump and other officials, seeking damages for the alleged violation of his right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, among other things.

He recently told NBC News that if Trump is elected to a second term in November, he ""won't stop with just locking people up"" unless there is a significant deterrent.

But constitutional claims against individual federal officials are notoriously difficult to bring as a result of a line of Supreme Court rulings.

The court in recent years has made it almost impossible to bring such civil rights claims because of a 1971 precedent called Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.

In a 2022 case called Egbert v. Boule, the Supreme Court effectively put ""Bivens claims"" on life support in a ruling that tossed out allegations against a Border Patrol agent.

As NBC News reported last year, the 2022 Egbert ruling has been cited hundreds of times by lower court judges when throwing out Bivens claims in cases concerning a broad range of allegedly unconstitutional conduct.

A federal judge in New York and the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals both highlighted the Supreme Court's recent ruling in throwing out Cohen's claims.",Oct 21 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/supreme-court-rejects-michael-cohens-civil-rights-claim-against-trump.html

Investors have been busy for at least the past several weeks bidding up prices in anticipation of what President-elect Donald Trump will do when he takes office. Expectations are running high that potential tariffs won't lead to adverse outcomes, the 2017 tax cuts will be renewed and be accompanied by others, and deregulation will spur dealmaking on Wall Street and lead to lower energy prices. That, of course, raises the question: What if they're wrong? More specifically, the anticipated course of lower taxes, less regulation and spending on energy and other initiatives has fueled a run in which the major averages have posted solid gains while prices for gold, silver and cryptocurrencies also have rallied. The S&P 500, for instance, is up about 3% over the past month, when bets started to accelerate that Trump would prevail.

Stock Chart Icon Stock chart icon S&P 500, 3 months

In some corners, there is concern that the market is pulling forward gains now and could pay the price later, particularly if the Trump initiatives not only boost growth but also aggravate inflation, as some economists fear. ""The markets were on a roar coming into the election, and now they are on a postelection high, really trading on euphoria, lower taxes, the pro-business stance of this new administration,"" Holly Newman Kroft, managing director at Neuberger Berman Private Wealth, said Tuesday on CNBC. ""The market's going to have to digest what the impact of this sort of tug-of-war between the pro-growth positioning of this administration and the risk of higher inflation.""

watch now

Inflation wasn't an issue the last time Trump took office in 2017, but it is now, even though it has drifted back toward the Federal Reserve's 2% 12-month goal. October's core consumer price index reading, excluding food and energy costs, came in at a 3.3% annual rate on Wednesday, far from the Fed's desired target. While Trump's stated intention to slap 10% across-the-board tariffs on imported goods might not in itself reignite price pressures, a full-blown global trade war could. It's also a different policy environment from then.

Trump presidency — then and now

When Trump took office in 2016, not only was inflation tame but the Fed's main policy rate also was anchored near zero. Now, it's in target range of 4.5%-4.75%, a restrictive level as central bank policymakers seek to balance a relative easing on inflation against concerns that the labor market is weakening. The stock market could yet post more gains into the end of the year, ""but we are not chasing trends aggressively into 2025,"" said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. ""For starters — this is not 2016 redux. Trump entered that year amid tailwinds related to an economy finally emerging from six years of secular stagnation with fed funds at zero,"" Shalett said in a note. ""While markets may be discounting policy certainty based on a monolithic view, our experience suggests that the current Trump policy agenda entails risks and contradictions that put a premium on sequencing and execution, even with strong congressional backing."" In other words, Trump's full goals may not come to fruition, and even if they do the timing of their implementation is uncertain. The investing implications are important, though perhaps not so ominous, according to strategists such as Kroft and Shalett. Despite her caution, Shalett said Morgan Stanley is ""not inclined to fundamentally revisit our asset allocation advice"" and instead is simply advising clients not to overload on risk and focus on ""broad balance and diversification."" Kroft also is recommending diversification and a focus on higher-quality names rather than chasing momentum. For instance, she said Neuberger Berman is underweight high-yield bonds and emerging market debt while taking an overweight position in small caps, which have performed well since the Trump victory.",Nov 13 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/markets-are-priced-to-perfection-on-the-trump-trade-heres-why-that-could-be-a-problem.html
"Hope he's okay' — Harris mocks Trump over town hall music interlude, as he stonewalls on health records","Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump listens during a town hall at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center and Fairgrounds in Oaks, Pennsylvania, on October 14, 2024. Jim Watson | Afp | Getty Images

Kamala Harris mocked Donald Trump's behavior at an unusual campaign event, where the GOP presidential nominee cut short a question-and-answer session to listen to music with the crowd for nearly 40 minutes. ""Hope he's okay,"" Harris, the Democratic nominee, wrote on X early Tuesday morning. The vice president's tweet was replying to her campaign X account's post saying, ""Trump appears lost, confused, and frozen on stage as multiple songs play for 30+ minutes and the crowd pours out of the venue early."" It was one of many posts by social media users that raised eyebrows over video from Monday night showing Trump swaying to music at his event outside Philadelphia. Trump, 78, in turn, on Tuesday suggested that Harris was unqualified to be president because of her minor allergies and hives, which were disclosed in health records she released this weekend. But Trump also doubled down on his refusal to release his own health records — which Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have cited as they question his fitness for office. Trump's campaign event Monday night was billed as a town hall where Trump would take questions from South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. But the Q&A portion was disrupted twice by medical emergencies in the crowd. At one point, the song ""Ave Maria"" played on the speakers as Trump and Noem waited for medical workers to attend to a person. After the second interruption, Trump stopped taking questions. ""Let's not do any more questions,"" Trump announced. ""Let's just listen to music. Let's make it into a music. Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?""

He then stood onstage facing the crowd, largely without speaking as a series of songs played through the venue's speakers. The music-listening portion of the evening went on for nearly 40 minutes. The songs included, ""Time to Say Goodbye,"" by Andrea Bocelli, Sinead O'Connor's ""Nothing Compares 2 U,"" Village People's ""Y.M.C.A.,"" James Brown's ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World,"" and Guns N' Roses' ""November Rain."" Trump left the stage to the sounds of ""Memory"" from the musical ""Cats."" Trump in a subsequent Truth Social post called the town hall ""amazing!"" ""The Q and A was almost finished when people began fainting from the excitement and heat. We started playing music while we waited, and just kept it going,"" he said. ""So different, but it ended up being a GREAT EVENING!"" In other Truth Social posts early Tuesday, Trump claimed he was ""far too busy campaigning to take time"" to devote to medical exams. But he also asserted that he has ""already provided them, many times, including quite recently, and they were flawless."" And in another post later Tuesday, he declared, ""MY REPORT IS PERFECT - NO PROBLEMS!!!"" He told CBS News in August that he would ""very gladly"" release his medical records, but his campaign has yet to do so. When CNBC asked the Trump campaign for the records that Trump claims he has already provided, spokesman Steven Cheung referred to his statement from Saturday that said Trump has ""voluntarily released updates"" from multiple sources. He pointed to a note last November from Trump's personal physician, Bruce Aronwald, and two memos written in late July by former White House physician Ronny Jackson after Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. ""All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief,"" Cheung wrote. Aronwald's 11-month-old, glowing letter concluded that Trump is ""in excellent health"" and likely to ""enjoy a health active lifestyle for years to come."" But it offered few details about Trump's medical history. The memos by Jackson focused on the injury Trump sustained when a bullet grazed his ear at the July 13 rally. Jackson, now a Republican congressman who represents a Texas district, is one of Trump's most loyal supporters. Harris on Saturday released a letter from her White House doctor describing the 59-year-old vice president as being in ""excellent health"" and capable of carrying out the duties of the presidency.

Harris' medical history includes seasonal allergies and hives, but she has never experienced severe symptoms, Dr. Joshua Simmons wrote in the two-page letter. After taking an antihistamine and an allergy medication, both issues have ""improved dramatically"" to the point that Harris has not needed any medication to manage her symptoms apart from an occasional nasal spray, Simmons wrote. A day after releasing her records, Harris blasted Trump at a campaign rally in North Carolina. ""He refuses to release his medical records,"" Harris said at the rally on Sunday. She also mocked Trump for recently ducking an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" and for declining to debate her a second time. ""Why does his staff want him to hide away?"" she asked. ""Are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable to lead America?""

"Trump Media stock surges as election betting odds shift, Truth Social launches streaming site","In this photo illustration a smartphone screen displays a post by Donald Trump on his Truth Social app, Sept. 12, 2024.

Shares of Trump Media closed up more than 18% on Monday, extending the Truth Social owner's dramatic recovery from recent stock price lows and adding hundreds of millions of dollars to Donald Trump's on-paper net worth.

The recent DJT surge came as multiple online election betting markets appeared to show betting odds shifting in Trump's favor, after weeks of tilting toward the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

Monday's surge also coincided with Trump Media's launch of a new site for its TV streaming app, Truth+.

Trump Media was trading above $30 per share at its intraday peak, and closed at $29.95.

The stock has experienced a wild flurry of trading in recent sessions, with shares being exchanged at multiple times the company's 30-day average volume. More than 57 million shares traded hands Monday.

In the past week, bets on the presidential election outcome hosted by contract market Kalshi and prediction trading platforms Polymarket and PredictIt all showed the odds of a Trump victory growing.

Those online gambling platforms, which are not based on methodologically sound data, shifted despite the latest polls at the national level and in key swing states continuing to show a neck-and-neck race.

Analysts have long suggested that many of Trump Media's retail investors are fans of the former president, and they are buying and selling the stock as a way to support him or bet on his odds of retaking the White House.

That dynamic could help explain how the company behind Truth Social boasts a market capitalization of almost $6 billion, and yet has a comparatively small user base and brings in little revenue.

Trump owns nearly 57% of the company's stock — worth around $3.4 billion at Monday's closing share price. He has vowed not to sell his stake, which currently makes up more than half of his on-paper net worth, according to Forbes.

Meanwhile, Trump Media on Monday morning announced the launch of a separate website for its in-platform streaming service, Truth+.

While a slimmer version of Truth+ already exists on Truth Social, the new site offers the ""full range"" of the company's streaming programming, Trump Media said in a press release.

The site says it offers more than 1,000 ""new movies and series,"" including exclusive content. The company's stated goal is to expand Truth+ to iOS devices and other TV-connected platforms, while making the service ""uncancellable by Big Tech.""

But most of the film and TV offerings appear to have been released years ago. And nearly all of the available movies are also on Tubi, another free streaming video platform.

Some of the content also appears to have been produced using artificial intelligence tools.

"How to respond to 'Who did you vote for?' when you just don't want to talk about it: 'Be direct, be clear, be authentic'","It's likely that anyone you talk to this week will want to discuss the election.

And while socializing and staying busy can alleviate some stress during this process, being in contact with certain friends or family can have the opposite effect, says Vanessa Kennedy, the director of psychology at Driftwood Recovery, a rehabilitation center in Austin, Texas.

""We all know people who may add to our anxiety as opposed to calming us in the face of uncertainty,"" she says.

If you want to avoid talking about who you voted for, or the election altogether, it's best to prepare some responses now should you encounter questions you don't want to answer.

There are a few communication strategies that politely steer the conversation away from voting, says Matt Abrahams, a Stanford University lecturer and communications expert.

""Don't hem and haw,"" he says. ""Be direct, be clear, be authentic.""

Here are four ways to answer the questions ""Who did you vote for?"" without actually answering it:

Blame: Tell the other person you made an agreement with yourself that you aren't going to talk politics. You can say something like ""I made a rule for myself that I'm not going to discuss the election until it's totally over."" You can also blame it on your partner saying ""I promised them we wouldn't talk about the election this week.""

You can say something like ""I made a rule for myself that I'm not going to discuss the election until it's totally over."" You can also blame it on your partner saying ""I promised them we wouldn't talk about the election this week."" Reframe: Shift the topic to be about a ballot measure or local race. This way you can engage the other person while honoring your boundaries. ""Say you don't want to talk about the presidential election, but can talk about your congressman,"" Abrahams says.

""Say you don't want to talk about the presidential election, but can talk about your congressman,"" Abrahams says. Explain: This is the most straightforward method. Tell the other person you're just not comfortable talking about it right now. Abrahams suggests saying something like this: ""After a couple days when the dust settles, I'll feel more at ease discussing this.""

Abrahams suggests saying something like this: ""After a couple days when the dust settles, I'll feel more at ease discussing this."" Entertain: Ask the other person about their views or how they are handling the election cycle. You can still participate without revealing your own stance.

Whatever you choose, be sure it feels natural to you. Abrahams uses the ""explain"" method.

""I never encourage you to be disingenuous,"" he says. ""For me, I don't want to talk about it because I'm super emotional. So I explain that's how I'm feeling.""

And if, for example, a reframe doesn't work, move on to a tactic you think will be more respected.

"Want to get in on crypto's postelection run? Be selective, experts advise","Investors looking to get in on crypto's monster run may want to be tactical in their approaches.

Bitcoin prices have surged roughly 30% since Election Day on Nov. 5, touching a record of more than $93,000 on Wednesday, according to Coin Metrics. Prices dipped below the $88,000 level just before Thursday's stock market close, as the postelection rally showed signs of fading.

""You need to understand how the cryptocurrency market is progressing, particularly around new administration policies,"" the firm's head of SPDR Americas research told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" on Monday.

Bartolini expects pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration to give an additional boost to the asset class.

Demand for Roth IRA conversions may increase — even without tax hikes from President-elect Donald Trump,"Before the election, some advisors increased Roth individual retirement account conversions for clients amid the threat of higher taxes after 2025. Now, tax hikes are less likely under President-elect Donald Trump. However, demand for Roth conversions will continue as investors seek long-term tax planning strategies, experts said. ""In general, we see an uptick in Roth conversions at the end of the year and into the new year ahead of the tax filing deadline in April, and we expect to see these trends again in 2025,"" said Rita Assaf, vice president of retirement offerings at Fidelity Investments.

Fidelity saw a 45% year-over-year increase in the volume of Roth conversions as of July, Assaf said. But while Roth conversions are on the rise, many investors are still learning about the strategy. ""I think you are only going to see an increase in Roth IRA conversions,"" said certified financial planner Byrke Sestok, a partner at Moneco Advisors in Harrison, New York. ""The percentage of people who know about the benefits of Roth IRA conversions is still low,"" he said. ""The number of people who actually execute a conversion is even lower.""

The benefit of Roth conversions

Roth conversions shift pretax or nondeductible IRA funds to a Roth IRA, which can jump-start tax-free growth. The trade-off is paying regular income taxes on the converted balance. With Trump's 2017 tax cuts scheduled to expire after 2025, including lower federal income tax brackets, some advisors have accelerated Roth conversions for their clients to leverage the lower tax rates through 2025.

However, Trump has vowed to extend his 2017 tax breaks, which would keep lower tax brackets intact. That plan could be easier if Republicans control the White House, Senate and House of Representatives. Even without tax increases from Congress, experts said, Roth conversions can reduce long-term taxes on your portfolio, particularly for older workers and retirees with sizable pretax balances. However, whether Roth conversions make sense depends on your ""unique financial situation,"" Assaf said.

Filling up tax brackets

Advisors often complete Roth conversions in lower-income years, such as early retirement before claiming Social Security benefits or taking required minimum distributions. The strategy can minimize the upfront tax bill while reducing your pretax balance. Currently, you may consider ""filling up the 12% and 24% tax brackets"" with income triggered by a Roth conversion because there's a big jump to the next tier, Sestok said.",Nov 8 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/08/roth-conversions-trump-presidency.html
Elon Musk offers $1 million a day to entice swing state voters to sign petition,"Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk, who supports Republican presidential nominee former U.S. President Donald Trump, gestures as he speaks about voting during an America PAC Town Hall in Folsom, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 17, 2024. Rachel Wisniewski | Reuters

Elon Musk said Saturday that he would randomly award $1 million a day to registered voters who sign a petition for his pro-Trump political action committee in an effort to get his fans in swing states to the polls. Speaking at an America PAC event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Musk said, ""I have a surprise for you,"" adding that the prize money is available ""every day from now until the election."" Musk then called up a man named John Dreher, who he said was one of the petition signees in attendance, and handed him a giant check. ""I think this is kind of fun, and you know, it seems like a good use of money basically,"" said the Tesla CEO, who is worth almost $250 billion. Musk, who is also CEO of defense contractor SpaceX and owner of social media platform X, embarked on a speaking tour in Pennsylvania to drive voter registration in his support of the Republican nominee. He called the state the ""linchpin"" in this election. ""How Pennsylvania goes I think is how the election goes,"" Musk said. The deadline to sign the petition is Monday night, which is the day Pennsylvania's voter registration closes. The petition, posted on the America PAC website, said that to be eligible for payments, signees ""must be registered voters of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin.""

Rick Hasen, a UCLA law professor and NBC News election law analyst, said in a blog post that Musk's initiative appears to be a violation of federal election laws, specifically one that says a person who ""pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."" ""Certain things in this country can be sold, and certain things we have decided should not be for sale,"" Hasen told CNBC in an interview. ""Congress has determined you should not be able to sell your vote to the highest bidder, and we should not have the political process distorted by people with the most wealth who may try to get you to vote in a certain way."" CNBC reached out to Musk and one of his advisors for comment, but they didn't respond. In an interview with NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said Musk's plan to give money to registered voters in his state is ""deeply concerning"" and ""it's something that law enforcement could take a look at.""

Floating conspiracy theories

At pro-Trump events, Musk has pushed debunked voter fraud conspiracies, called for deregulation, and repeatedly characterized President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Donald Trump's rival, as replaceable ""puppets."" ""No one's even bothering to try to kill Kamala, you know, because there's no point,"" Musk said on Saturday, repeating a line he's used in the past that caught the attention of the Secret Service. ""I'm not suggesting someone should try to kill her, it would be pointless, but I'm just saying. I'm just making an observation."" Musk said in his appearances that he views many government agencies and regulations in the U.S. as ineffective and unnecessary. Trump has taken up an idea floated by Musk to create a government efficiency commission, and said the tech magnate would be a big part of the commission. ""We should not trust the government, really. We just shouldn't,"" Musk said Harrisburg. ""Even if I'm in the government, don't trust the government."" While Musk's companies have long relied on government spending and support, he's berated the Federal Communications Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Aviation Administration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries for holding SpaceX back. ""We get crazy things,"" Musk said, ""like SpaceX got fined $140,000 for dumping potable drinking water on the ground at Starbase."" As CNBC previously reported, SpaceX has repeatedly discharged hot, industrial wastewater into the wetlands surrounding the company's launch pad in Boca Chica, Texas, which the EPA found was a Clean Water Act violation.

Musk mocked NOAA Fisheries for asking SpaceX to conduct a study to predict how its rockets could impact sharks and whales if they fall into the ocean. ""I'm like, it's a big ocean, you know, there's a lot of sharks. It's not impossible, but it's very unlikely,"" Musk said. The agency's mission is to ""conserve America's coastal and marine resources."" Musk's animosity toward Biden picked up in 2021, when the White House declined to invite Tesla to an electric vehicle summit. ""You know, Tesla's about 140,000 people -- it's like there's a lot of blood, sweat and tears from people working hard to make great electric cars,"" Musk said Saturday. ""To be could-shouldered like that for no reason. It's like, what's the deal?"" Musk has long battled unions, and Tesla was charged with union busting before the EV summit. Biden has maintained a pro-labor platform throughout his presidency. One attendee in Harrisburg asked Musk if he believed that self-driving cars should eventually be mandatory if they can perform more safely in traffic than human drivers. Tesla has promised customers a ""robotaxi"" for years, but never produced one. Musk suggested he was against anything federally mandated. ""We should just get the government out of things and let the market figure it out,"" he said. ""I'm generally against government. With that, I'd like to thank you all for coming. It's been an honor to speak with you."" Musk only mentioned Trump sparingly throughout the evening, and didn't discuss his policies or record as president in any detail.",Oct 20 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/20/elon-musk-offers-1-million-a-day-to-entice-swing-state-voters-.html

Europe could try to stop — or get around — damaging Trump tariffs," A ship carries shipping containers through Upper Bay in New York, U.S., September 30, 2024. Caitlin Ochs | Reuters

Donald Trump's U.S. election win has left Europe scrabbling to work out how it will be able to contain or counter highly probable tariffs on its exports to the U.S. once the president-elect enters the White House. Ahead of his decisive election win last week, Trump had already threatened to revive a trade war that began during his first term in office, stating in his election campaign that he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods by 60-100%, and would impose a blanket 10% to 20% tariff on all U.S. imports. Trump sees the protectionist move as a way to boost U.S. jobs and growth, but the policy would undoubtedly open up a new front in trade tensions with two of the country's largest trading partners, the EU and China. Critics of the proposed tariffs say the policy could lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers.

While Trump has a reputation for unpredictability, meaning his rhetoric sometimes fails to materialize in terms of policy, analysts agree that the president-elect appears undeterred when it comes to trade tariffs, having opined on how the term itself is ""the most beautiful word in the dictionary."" That leaves Asia and Europe having to quickly consider ways to mitigate the future impact of export tariffs, and whether to retaliate or to try to negotiate a get-out deal. Economists caution that it's uncertain whether Trump's tariffs on Europe will be ""as damaging as feared,"" as ING economists stated in a note last Friday, or whether they will simply be ""a bargaining chip designed to unlock wider foreign policy deals."" Nonetheless, there have been calls in Europe for the bloc to prepare retaliatory measures now, with the director of Germany's Ifo Center for International Economics calling on Germany — which relies heavily on trade with the U.S., particularly in terms of vehicle exports — and the EU to ""strengthen their position through measures of their own."" ""These include deeper integration of the EU services market and credible retaliatory measures against the U.S.,"" Ifo's Lisandra Flach said last week. The proposed measures include the potential use of the EU's new ""Anti-Coercion Instrument"" that gives the gives the region a wide range of possible countermeasures when, it says, ""a country refuses to remove the coercion."" The countermeasures include the imposition of tariffs, restrictions on trade in services and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, and restrictions on access to foreign direct investment and public procurement. Germany and the EU could also strengthen cooperation with individual U.S. states, Flach suggested. But economists also say that the EU could try to use the carrot instead of the stick with the U.S., suggesting there are three other ways Europe might try to stop, limit or avoid Trump's likely tariff policy altogether.

Concessions

As a starting position with the incoming Republican administration, European policymakers could aim to avoid tariffs altogether, economists note, by offering to boost select American imports in exchange for the U.S. giving it an exemption from tariffs. ""This may include LNG [liquefied natural gas] and soybeans, both of which were part of a deal between Donald Trump and then-president of the [European Commission] Jean-Claude Juncker in July 2018,"" Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note last Friday.

Analysts at Eurasia Group, led by Mujtaba Rahman, commented that a ""transactional strategy"" was likely to be pursued first by the European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen. This would see the EU be guided by the goal of bolstering U.S. exports in key sectors such as agriculture, energy (LNG), and defense. ""The EU is likely to pledge to further expand LNG imports from the U.S. Von der Leyen may also explore closing two deals the commission had been negotiating with President Joe Biden, on the Global Arrangement for Sustainable Steel and Aluminium and an EU-US Critical Minerals Agreement. An attempt is also likely to do more via the EU-US Trade and Technology Council, which has helped foster some collaboration on digital issues, such as AI and export controls,"" the analysts at Eurasia Group noted.

A geopolitical deal

Alternatively, Kenningham said the two sides could strike ""a broader geopolitical deal to try to head off the tariff threat."" ""The EU could, for example, make a commitment to purchase more defence equipment from the U.S. in order to continue supporting Ukraine — although the EU would find it difficult to agree on how to raise the funds given the staunch opposition of many, including Germany, to more joint EU borrowing."" A deal is likely to be favorable to European policymakers as they look to limit the economic hit a 10% U.S. tariff would have on European exports. ""The key point is that, while our working assumption is that there is a 10% US tariff which subtracts only 0.2% from euro-zone GDP, the outcome could be less than that if the EU is successful in reaching some kind of deal,"" Kenningham said.

Whether there Europe can reach consensus on how or whether to do a deal with Trump is debateable, however. Carsten Brzeski, global head of Macro at ING, said in a post-election note last week that ""Trump hits Europe not only at a time of economic weakness but also one of political instability."" ""During the first Trump term, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel were a strong political axis. Today, France is struggling, and the German government has just collapsed. There's not exactly a strong bulwark,"" he said. ""It really casts doubts about Europe's ability to find adequate responses to Trump,"" he added.

 The U.S. election is a make-or-break moment for aid to Ukraine,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks as he meets with democratic presidential nominee and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris (not pictured), in the Vice President's Ceremonial Office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus in Washington, U.S., September 26, 2024. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters

Tensions are likely running high in Kyiv ahead of Tuesday's presidential election in the U.S. — a vote that could make or break ongoing aid for Ukraine. The latest poll from NBC News showed a ""deadlocked race"" between Republican nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump and the Democrats' candidate, current Vice President Kamala Harris. For Kyiv, the big issue is how much support and financial backing it will continue to receive after White House leader Joe Biden, who has been in term throughout Russia's war in Ukraine, leaves office. Follow: Election 2024 live updates: Trump and Harris await Presidential election results After almost three years of fighting, there's no doubt that funding fatigue is setting in among Kyiv's biggest military supporters, particularly the U.S., despite ongoing public shows of support for Ukraine from the White House and NATO. It's widely agreed that a Trump administration and hard-line Republicans would be far more hostile toward granting Ukraine more military aid, significantly inhibiting its ability to continue to fight back against Russia. However, it's also likely that even a Kyiv-friendly administration under Kamala Harris, who has pledged to continue supporting the war-torn nation, could struggle to convince U.S. lawmakers to give far more financial backing to Ukraine. Officials in Kyiv say the election is being watched closely, amid concerns that future aid could be cut. ""Of course, we understand that this is one of the possible scenarios which would be heavily unfavorable for Ukraine,"" senior Ukrainian official Yuriy Sak told CNBC last week. ""But on our part, we will do everything to continue to convince our partners in the U.S. to maintain the funding and the support at the same level, because the alternative is bad for all parties involved, including the United States of America,"" he added. ""We, of course, are watching very closely what is happening. We have our opinion about the different candidates, but ... we hope and count that regardless of who is the next president, the United States of America will continue to support Ukraine until our victory and until we re-establish just peace.""

Ukraine relies on its international partners for the military, humanitarian and financial needed to both keep the country functioning economically, and to remain militarily capable of fighting back against Russian forces entrenched in southern Ukraine, and those slowly advancing in the Donbas region in the east of the country. The Kiel Institute of the World Economy, seen as one of the most reliable trackers of external aid for Ukraine, calculates that the U.S. has spent nearly $108 billion on military, humanitarian and financial aid since the start of the war in Feb. 2022 to Aug. 31 this year, while EU member states and institutions (such as the European Investment Bank and European Commission) have spent a collective 161.11 billion euros ($175.47 billion on such aid.)

The likelihood of funding drying up

U.S. largesse toward Ukraine has become an increasingly tough sell to U.S. lawmakers, with months of delays and objections from hard-line Republicans over a $61-billion aid package that was eventually passed in spring. A crucial factor for Ukraine is whether the Democrats of Republicans dominate Congress after the election, a deciding factor in how much power the future president wields, and to what extent he or she is able to support — or thwart — Ukraine financially. Donald Trump has heavily suggested that he would pull the plug on military aid for Kyiv, after claiming that he would stop the war within 24 hours of being elected, without providing further details of how he would do so. Analysts say it's likely that Trump sees a block on funding as a way to forcibly stop the war. His running mate J.D. Vance is explicitly opposed to further aid for Ukraine, arguing that the U.S. should encourage Kyiv to strike a peace deal with Russia and should be prepared to cede land to Moscow.

Trump pulling the plug on Ukraine funding immediately would be an extreme scenario, according to economists at Berenberg Bank, but is a distinct possibility from a politician known for his unpredictability. ""Although Europe is the top donor to Ukraine, U.S. military assistance is vital for Kyiv,"" Berenberg Bank said in emailed comments last month. ""Unless Europe steps into the breach fast and issues, say, €50 billion [$54.1 billion] of bonds so it can buy in the U.S. the weapons and ammunition that Ukraine needs but Europe cannot produce, Putin could win the war of attrition, forcing Ukraine into submission."" While an election win for Harris would be a relief for Kyiv, given that she has vehemently pledged her administration would support Ukraine ""for as long as it takes,"" neither she nor Washington has ever clearly defined the exact meaning of her statement, what a Ukrainian victory looks like, or whether there is a limit to U.S. aid. In the week before the presidential election, Western officials were reported as saying that a Harris administration would likely struggle to push significant aid for Ukraine through Congress. CNBC has reached out to the Harris and Trump campaign teams.

Making Russia pay?

Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) group of industrialized countries have looked to ""Trump-proof"" near-term aid to Ukraine ahead of the Nov.5 election, agreeing in late October a $50 billion loan to Ukraine that will be backed by frozen Russian assets. The G7 said it would start disbursing the funds before the end of the year, essentially before any new U.S. administration can row back on the agreement. If the U.S. pulls back on funding for Ukraine in 2025, however, Europe will be on the hook to support Kyiv going forward, making the thorny issue of continuing to use the proceeds of a deep pool of frozen Russian central bank assets — the vast majority of which are held in Europe — a pressing point. ""Now $50 billion [agreed by the G7] sounds like a lot of cash but it only amounts to 3-4 months of Ukraine's funding needs,"" Timothy Ash, emerging markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said in emailed comments last month. He is among those pressing for an estimated $330 billion immobilized Russian assets to be seized and allocated to Ukraine to help it continue to fight back against Russia, and he has noted the pushback from some EU nations who fear Russia will retaliate against such a move. Some nations have more to fear than others; currently, around $191 billion of all immobilized Russia assets are held in the Belgian central securities depository, Euroclear.

Kevin Lamarque | Reuters

Ash said he would urge any future Trump administration to pressure the EU ""to release the full $330 billion in assets to Ukraine."" ""Ukraine could then fund its own defence and recovery,"" he said, flagging the country could perhaps even commit to spending a large proportion of the funds to buy defense equipment in the U.S. ""A sum of $150 billion spent in the U.S. over ten years say would be the biggest foreign defence purchase in the U.S.' history. It would save the U.S. taxpayer writing cheques for Ukraine, secure thousands of defence industry jobs in the U.S., help win Ukraine the war and build up its own defence against future Russian attack, and all funded by the aggressor — Russia,"" Ash suggested.

A precarious future

Whatever the outcome of Tuesday's vote, analysts agree that Ukraine faces a precarious future amid waning Western support and funding fatigue. Tim Willasey-Wilsey, senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank, commented that ""the immediate peril"" for Ukraine comes from the 2024 U.S. presidential election. ""The forthcoming presidential election in the US represents the point of maximum danger. A win by Donald Trump could see him placing a phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin as early as 6 November.

Supreme Court rejects Mark Meadows appeal in Georgia election interference case,"Mark Meadows, former White House chief of staff during the Trump administration, speaks during a forum titled House Rules and Process Changes for the 118th Congress at FreedomWorks headquarters in Washington, D.C., Nov. 14, 2022.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a setback to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in his defense against 2020 election interference charges in Georgia, turning away his attempt to transfer his case from state to federal court.

His lawyers argued that the case should be moved because he was acting as a ""federal officer"" at the time and could therefore argue for immunity from prosecution.

The argument failed in lower courts, with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluding that as Meadows is no longer a federal official, the provision that would allow the case to be moved to federal court does not apply to him.

The appeals court also found that even if he was deemed to be a federal officer, ""the events giving rise to this criminal action were not related to Meadows' official duties.""

Meadows faces two counts in the sprawling Georgia election interference case over his role in efforts to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty.

There are 18 other defendants, including Trump himself, who also has pleaded not guilty to the charges.",Nov 12 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/supreme-court-rejects-mark-meadows-appeal-in-georgia-election-interference-case.html?__source=appletv%7Cproqrcode%7Cfeatured
"Voters ages 50 and up may decide the 2024 presidential election based on 'day-to-day pocketbook issues,' expert says","A person arrives to vote at a polling station on Election Day, in The Villages, Florida.

In a heated presidential race, there's one age cohort — voters ages 50 and up — who may help decide the ultimate winner.

""We expect the 50-plus electorate to be the majority of the electorate, and we think at the end of the day they're going to determine the outcome of the election, particularly in the swing states,"" said John Hishta, senior vice president for campaigns at AARP, an interest group focusing on issues related to individuals 50 and up.

About 90% ages 50 and up say they are extremely motivated to vote, AARP has found, versus 75% of voters under age 50.

Much of whether individuals in the 50-plus camp choose the Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, or the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, comes down to who they perceive to be better for their wallets.

""It's all related to day-to-day pocketbook issues, and who's better able to handle those issues moving forward,"" Hishta said.

Inflation ranks as a top concern, as well as Social Security due to the high cost of living, he said.

Prescription drug prices, which tend to take up a larger share of household budgets as people age, are also top of mind. Caregiving is another area this cohort is paying attention to, since a substantial portion of people ages 50 and over serve in those roles, he said.",Nov 5 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/05/why-voters-ages-50-and-up-may-decide-the-2024-presidential-election.html
Powell and the Fed won't be able to avoid talking about Trump forever,"Federal Reserve Board Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington on November 07, 2024 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura | Getty Images

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dodged question after question at his Thursday news conference from a press corps eager to elicit the central bank leader's thoughts about President-elect Donald Trump. At some point, though, Fed policymakers, economists and analysts will need to account for what likely will be an ambitious economic — not to mention political — agenda from the firebrand Republican. Trump took a dim view of the Powell Fed during his first term in office, calling policymakers ""boneheads"" and once compared Powell to a golfer who couldn't putt. Powell, who was nominated by Trump in November 2017 and took office the following February, largely shrugged off the criticism then, and he again deflected Thursday. ""I'm not going to get into any of the political things here today, but thank you,"" Powell said during the news conference after being asked at least half a dozen times about the Trump victory and its ramifications. Powell cut the session short around 3:12 p.m. ET, a few minutes earlier than normal following the round of politics-heavy questioning. However, dealing with the ramifications of a Trump presidency will be almost unavoidable for the Fed leader. Among the expected policy initiatives on the way are steep tax cuts, expansionary government spending and aggressive tariffs aimed at leveling a global playing field. Trump also has threatened mass deportations for undocumented immigrants, something that could alter the labor market landscape. How the Trump-Powell relationship unfolds this time is unclear — Powell's term as chair is up in February 2026 — but it is likely to add another wrinkle into a delicate balance the Fed is trying to navigate with monetary policy.

Differences in policies, politics

""They're going to get themselves in a bind here, because the communication is going to get much more difficult, and there's going to be a new administration coming in with its own way of how to view policy,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""It's not clear to me that the Fed is going to have the same type of approach of what the [new] administration is doing, and that I think could set up a lot more tension,"" he added. LaVorgna has a unique perspective on the situation, having served as chief economist for the National Economic Council under Trump. He could be headed back to Washington in 2025 for another stint in the White House.

watch now

Like Trump, LaVorgna has been a Fed critic, though for a seemingly opposite reason as he thinks the central bank made a mistake Thursday in lowering its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point. LaVorgna instead advocated the Fed hold off until it can get a clearer picture of a muddied economic landscape with uncertainty over the direction of inflation and unemployment. Trump historically has favored lower rates, though that too could change if the Fed cuts and inflation rises. ""What if, going forward, the outlook becomes more mixed?"" Lavorgna said. ""To me, it was obvious they shouldn't be cutting. And then President Trump I think [could] properly ask, 'Why are you cutting when things [with inflation] actually don't look as solid as they might have before?'"" Many economists think Trump's policies could help stoke inflation at a time when signs are showing that, at least on a relative basis, the pace of price increases is easing back toward the Fed's 2% target. Some of those economists already this week started marking up their inflation estimates and cutting their outlook for growth, despite a high level of uncertainty about what the Trump agenda will actually entail. Should those forecasts come true and inflation perk up, the Fed will have no choice but to respond, possibly by slowing the pace of rate cuts or stopping altogether.",Nov 8 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/08/powell-and-the-fed-wont-able-to-avoid-talking-about-trump-forever.html
Nearly $1 billion has been spent on political ads over the last week,"Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, greets supporters during a campaign rally at The Expo at World Market Center Las Vegas on September 13, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

With Election Day around the corner, there's been just shy of $1 billion spent on political ads up and down the ballot in the last week, data from the ad-tracking firm AdImpact shows.

The $994 million is close to one-tenth of the more than $10 billion that's been spent on political advertising so far since the start of 2023, spent across just seven days. And while Election Day may bring a temporary end to the spending onslaught that's seemingly dominated every television commercial break in recent weeks, it's not over yet: There's still more than $300 million in future advertising time booked between Sunday and Tuesday.

The most expensive race over the last week is, unsurprisingly, the presidential race, where more than $272 million has been spent on ads, according to data from AdImpact. Former President Donald Trump's campaign has narrowly outspent Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign $43.4 million to $40.7 million between Oct. 27 and Nov. 2, but Democratic super PACs helped the party narrowly outspend Republicans over that period in the presidential race.",Nov 3 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/03/nearly-1-billion-has-been-spent-on-political-ads-over-the-last-week.html
Trump wants to provide a tax credit for caregivers. Here's what experts say about the proposal,"JGI/Tom Grill | Tetra images | Getty Images

At a recent campaign rally, President-elect Donald Trump promised new financial help for family caregivers. ""I will support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one,"" Trump said during an October speech at New York's Madison Square Garden. ""It's about time that they were recognized, right?"" he said. ""They add so much to our country and are never spoken of ever, ever, ever, but they're going to be spoken of now."" Trump has not elaborated on the details of that tax credit, and his team did not respond to requests for comment. He has also promised other tax breaks, including eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, tips and overtime and a deduction for auto loan interest payments. ""It definitely adds up to big net tax cut,"" Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said of the president-elect's tax proposals.

Family caregiving has a 'political moment'

Family caregiving had a ""bit of a political moment"" this election cycle, with both presidential candidates addressing the topic, Nancy LeaMond, chief advocacy and engagement officer at AARP, said during a webinar Monday hosted by the organization, which represents people ages 50 and up. About 48 million Americans help take care of aging parents, spouses or other loved ones, according to AARP. And about 78% of those caregivers have paid for care-related expenses out of their own pockets. On average, that adds up to about $7,200 per year. ""This adds to the economic strain they feel and anxiety about their long-term financial security,"" LeaMond said. ""They're cutting back on personal spending, dipping into their savings and reducing what they're saving for their own retirement."" A record number of Americans are expected to turn 65 in the coming years. However, the share of potential caregivers is projected to shrink versus the number of older adults who may need long-term care, according to AARP.

How Black business leaders are thinking about a coming Trump administration,"Black business leaders are trying to figure out why Vice President Kamala Harris lost the presidential race, and how to approach the coming administration of President-elect Donald Trump.

""It certainly means change. That's what the voters wanted, and that's what they thought President Trump represents,"" said Charles Phillips, co-chair of the Black Economic Alliance and co-founder of Recognize.

""What contributed to Trump's win is people are tired of the cultural battles ... people are more interested in kitchen table and economic issues,"" he told CNBC in an interview.

According to NBC News, Trump's economic policies were a key reason he gained support from Black voters in battleground states such as North Carolina and Wisconsin.

But Ryan Wilson, co-founder and CEO of the Gathering Spot, believes Harris' race and gender were the primary reasons for her loss.

Trump Media shares surge 21% after Trump rally in New York City,"Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump holds a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York on Oct. 27, 2024.

But the Truth Social operator recovered all of those losses in October, as the election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris , the Democratic nominee, entered its final weeks.

That spike was followed by a major sell-off that hit bottom in late September, when DJT stock scraped below $12 a share.

Trump Media stock closed $47.36 per share, eclipsing its recent peak in mid-July, when the company's market value soared after Trump was nearly assassinated at a rally in Pennsylvania.

Shares of Donald Trump 's social media company surged more than 21% Monday, on the heels of the Republican presidential nominee's campaign rally in New York City.

Trump owns nearly 57% of Trump Media. That stake at Monday's intraday high totaled about $5.4 billion — more than half of Trump's on-paper net worth, according to Forbes.

The value of Trump's majority stake has increased about $4 billion in the weeks since Trump Media hit its late-September lows.

During that time, the company has rolled out a separate streaming app, Truth+, and announced the resignation of its chief operating officer.

But analysts have frequently suggested that Trump Media's multibillion-dollar market value and volatile stock movements have little to do with company news — or the performance of Truth Social, which generates scant revenue and draws a relatively miniscule audience.

They have instead come to view the stock as an outlet for the company's many pro-Trump retail investors to support the former president, and a proxy for betting on his odds of retaking the White House.

Monday's stock surge could suggest those traders are feeling a burst of enthusiasm after Trump's much-promoted rally in Manhattan's Madison Square Garden, which drew thousands of his supporters to the heart of a deep-blue metropolis.

""Our dear President @realDonaldTrump packs MSG yesterday for the Rally of a lifetime and TODAY, the entire market is UP UP UP!!! $DJT,"" one Truth Social user wrote Monday morning in a Trump Media shareholder group.

Trump Media's recent gains have coincided with a shift in the Republican's favor on political betting sites such as Polymarket and Kalshi, even as polls broadly show a neck-and-neck race.

Odds and gambling platforms do not use the same methodologies used by traditional political polling, and therefore are not substitutes for political polls.

Critics have raised concerns that the election betting markets are being manipulated.

Tesla hits $1 trillion market cap as stock rallies after Trump win,"Elon Musk on stage before Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York, NY on Sunday, October 27, 2024.

Tesla had a market cap of $807.1 billion through Tuesday's close. Before this week's rally, shares of the carmaker were up about 1% for the year. Tesla's stock is now up about 30% year to date.

The company's stock has rallied about 29% this week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election and investors have grown optimistic that the former leader's return to the White House could benefit Tesla. Elon Musk , Tesla's CEO, has been a key ally for Trump throughout his campaign, pouring at least $130 million into a pro-Trump campaign effort.

Tesla rejoins a growing club of tech names that are now worth more than $1 trillion, including Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon and Meta (though all but Meta are worth more than $2 trillion). Tesla's market cap first crossed the $1 trillion mark in October 2021.

Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has said that a potential Trump administration could spell less regulation for Tesla and other companies.

""Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the U.S. market over the coming years,"" Ives wrote in a note to clients this week.

Trump has said previously he may cut the federal $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Those credits have helped to drive sales of Tesla vehicles historically.

In its most recent earnings update, Tesla reported revenue of $25.18 billion and net income of $2.17 billion in the third quarter.

CEO Musk said on the earnings call that his ""best guess"" was that ""vehicle growth"" would reach 20% to 30% next year, due to ""lower cost vehicles"" and the ""advent of autonomy.""

Tesla has been promising, and developing, driverless vehicle technology for more than a decade. Its key U.S. competitor, Alphabet-owned Waymo, has pulled ahead and is already operating commercial robotaxi services in several major cities.

On the third-quarter call, Musk said he would use his sway with a Trump-Vance administration to establish a ""federal approval process for autonomous vehicles."" Currently, approvals happen at the state level, which the CEO sees as a regulatory hurdle Tesla will need to overcome once it finally offers more than partially automated driving systems.

 Mortgage rates are likely to stay high after Trump's election win—despite Fed rate cuts,"The rate has risen by nearly 1% since September, even after two Federal Reserve cuts to its benchmark interest rate totaling 0.75%, including a 25 basis point cut announced Thursday .

Following Donald Trump's Presidential election win, 30-year fixed mortgage rates briefly surged, settling at 6.98% as of Thursday, according to Mortgage News Daily .

Recent interest rate cuts have brought relief to credit card, personal loan and auto borrowers, but homebuyers are unlikely to catch a break as mortgage rates continue to climb.

While mortgage rates often move in step with the Fed's benchmark rate, they're more directly tied to 10-year Treasury bond yields. These yields tend to rise when investors expect stronger economic growth and higher inflation — even when the Federal Reserve is cutting the federal funds rate.

""Since the middle of September, there have been a series of economic data reports showing that the economy is stronger than expected,"" says Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage in New York. ""When people have jobs and make money, they spend it, and that's inflationary.""

The ramp up in mortgage rates also reflects market expectations that ""President-elect Trump will accelerate the growth of the budget deficit more quickly than Vice President Harris would,"" says Michael Nourmand, president of the brokerage Nourmand & Associates in Los Angeles. Trump's proposed tariffs on imported goods could also drive inflation by raising prices, he says.

Mortgage rates are expected to ease slightly in the coming months, but will likely remain around 6% well into 2025, according to forecasts by major mortgage lenders and industry associations — nearly double their levels from three years ago.

But if Republicans gain control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress, fewer obstacles to new spending could drive bond yields higher, with investors expecting more borrowing and inflation risks, according to Mortgage News Daily.

Either way, ""continued deficit spending, coupled with discussions of additional tariffs on imports, is likely to keep [mortgage] rates elevated through the remainder of 2024,"" says Nourmand.

"Argentina's Milei is a VIP at Mar-a-Lago as Trump, Musk embrace his attacks on government spending","Self-described anarcho-capitalist President Javier Milei of Argentina became the first foreign leader to visit President-elect Donald Trump since he won a second term, arriving in Florida on Thursday to attend a gala dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, where Milei was a VIP speaker.

""The world is a much better place, and the winds of freedom are blowing much stronger,"" now that Trump had been elected, said Milei.

He called Trump's Nov. 5 victory, ""The greatest political comeback in all of history, defying the political establishment even at the risk of his own life.""

Milei also name-checked another attendee in the gala crowd: Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

""I would like to thank the great Elon Musk for the wonderful job he has been doing to save humanity,"" Milei said through an interpreter.

Milei's presence in Florida on Thursday, and his warm words for Trump and Musk, offer a glimpse of what is an evolving, and important, dynamic between the two American billionaires and a leader who has promised to save Argentina's long-struggling economy through ""shock therapy"" — deep spending cuts and slashing regulations.

Musk and Milei are already big fans of each other. They've met several times, and Milei has been to the Tesla factory and posted photos of the two together.

A photo Milei posted in September shows Musk sporting a ""dark MAGA"" hat, Trump's campaign logo written in black on black.

Photos from the Thursday gala posted on social media showed Musk, Milei and Trump together, all smiles.

Musk has spent the last week at Mar-a-Lago, acting as one of Trump's closest advisors as the president-elect fills his Cabinet with unexpected picks — several of whom have promised to bring their own kind of shock therapy to the federal agencies they've been chosen to lead.

Trump has also announced that Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" that will be dedicated to drastically cutting the federal budget.

The announcement fulfilled Trump's campaign promise to give Musk a major role advising his administration on government spending. Despite the name, the DOGE will not be a federal agency, acting instead as an outside advisory panel to the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Still, Musk claims he can cut $2 trillion out of the roughly $6.75 trillion U.S. budget. The only place where cuts on this scale have been implemented in recent years is Argentina, under Milei.

""All government spending, it either becomes inflation or direct taxation. The Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that,"" Musk said at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally last month.

To understand the origins of Musk's notion of reducing the federal budget by a third, consider what Milei has accomplished.

Since taking office last December, Milei has cut Argentina's federal spending by 32%, according to the Center for Argentine Political Economy, or CEPA.

In a country where annual inflation rates have topped 300% and destabilized the nation, this October, inflation in Argentina hit its lowest level since 2017: 2.7%",Nov 15 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/trump-elon-musk-javier-milei-government-cuts.html
"Trump family gets 75% of crypto coin revenue, has no liability, new document reveals","Donald Trump's crypto project, World Liberty Financial, published a 13-page document Thursday that described its mission and how tokens can be allocated, and that indicated that the Republican presidential nominee and his family could take home 75% of net revenue.

In what it calls the ""World Liberty Gold Paper,"" World Liberty Financial, or WLF, said the Trump family will receive 22.5 billion ""$WLFI"" tokens, currently valued at $337.5 million, based on the price of 1.5 cents per token at launch this week.

Trump, who's in a virtual dead heat with Vice President Kamala Harris as the election reaches its closing stages, has spent months pumping his crypto project, previously branding it as ""The DeFiant Ones,"" a play on DeFi, short for decentralized finance.

On Tuesday, the project launched the WLFI token and said in a roadmap that it was looking to raise $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in its initial sale. As of Thursday, only $12.9 million worth of the token has been sold, according to its website.

The paper released Thursday shows that Trump and his family assume no liability. It indicates that none of them are directors, employees, managers or operators of WLF or its affiliates, and said the project and the tokens ""are not political and have no affiliation with any political campaign.""

WLF didn't respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign referred questions to the Trump Organization, which didn't immediately responded to a request for comment.

Crypto projects typically release white papers before they launch their coins, offering a guide so that investors can learn more about the mission, goals and how future tokens get allocated. WLF's paper says that a Delaware-based company named DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is connected to the former president, is set to receive three-quarters of the net protocol revenues.

WLF bills itself as a crypto bank where customers will be encouraged to borrow, lend and invest in digital coins. The document released Thursday defines net protocol revenue as income to WLF from ""any source, including without limitation platform use fees, token sale proceeds, advertising or other sources of revenue, after deduction of agreed expenses and reserves for WLF's continued operations.""

Some $30 million of the initial revenue is earmarked to be held in a reserve intended to cover operating expenses and other financial obligations.

The remaining 25% of net protocol revenue is set to go to Axiom Management Group, or AMG, a Puerto Rico LLC wholly owned by Chase Herro and Zachary Folkman, two of the co-founders.

Folkman previously had a company called Date Hotter Girls and reportedly helped develop crypto project Dough Finance. Herro worked on Dough and launched another crypto trading business a decade ago called Pacer Capital, which appears to now be defunct.

AMG has agreed to allocate half of its rights to net protocol revenues to a third LLC called WC Digital Fi, which is an affiliate of Trump's close friend and political donor, Steve Witkoff, as well as to ""certain of his family members."" Witkoff's son, Zachary, is also listed as one of the co-founders of the project.

Folkman previously said just 20% of WLF's tokens would be allotted to the founding team, which includes the Trump family. The paper spells out the breakdown of anticipated coin allocation, with 35% of total supply allocated to the token sale, 32.5% to community growth and incentives, 30% to initial support allocation, and 2.5% to team and advisors.

The document specifies in the fine print that these ""anticipated token distribution amounts are subject to change."" It's unclear which categories include Trump and his family.

The paper calls Trump the ""chief crypto advocate."" His three sons are all ""Web3 ambassadors.""

"Investors should stay with their long-term financial plans no matter who is in the White House, advisors say","A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Money 101 newsletter with Sharon Epperson, an eight-week series to improve your financial wellness with monthly updates. Sign up to receive these editions, straight to your inbox. Stocks soared in the days after President-elect Donald Trump won the 2024 election, and the Federal Reserve announced another interest rate cut less than two days later. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq markets reached record highs and their best week in a year. Yet, Wall Street's reaction to the election outcome does not reflect how many Americans feel about the state of their personal finances, some financial experts say. ""Vibecession,"" or the disconnect between the markets, the economy and people's feelings about their financial standing, continues. Feelings, however, should not overshadow anyone's focus when assessing the potential impact of a second Trump presidency when it comes to finances, advisors say. ""While a new presidency may bring changes to the economic environment, it's crucial to focus on financial strategies within our control,"" said certified financial planner Rianka Dorsainvil, founder and senior wealth advisor at YGC Wealth and a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. ""Stick to your long-term financial plan, adjusting only when your personal circumstances or goals change.""

Consumers and investors have little or no control over government policies on tariffs, taxes, interest rates or the state of the economy. However, improving your personal economy is possible by taking better control of your money, experts say. Here are five ways to improve your finances: 1. Build an emergency fund Build up your emergency funds in a high-yield savings account. ""Aim for three to six months of living expenses,"" Dorsainvil said. ""This financial buffer provides peace of mind and stability, regardless of broader economic conditions. It ensures you're prepared for unexpected expenses or income disruptions."" 2. Increase savings goals Boost savings goals in accounts that also offer tax breaks. Compare tax advantages of traditional and Roth 401(k) plans and other workplace retirement savings accounts — and Roth IRAs, too. ""If you've got a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, if you put it in the stable value fund or the cash option and you put in $100 with each paycheck, you're ahead of the game,"" said CFP Lee Baker, founder of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta.

Parliamentary elections in Georgia this weekend have been described as the vote ""of a lifetime"" that will determine whether the country moves toward Russia or the West. The vote on Saturday is being closely watched for whether the ruling ""Georgian Dream"" party — which has morphed from an expressly pro-Western grouping over its 12 years in power to a decidedly pro-Russia one in recent years — can hold on to office, or whether it will unseated by pro-Western opposition parties. Voter polls in the run-up to the vote are considered unreliable as they have generally been commissioned or conducted by pro-opposition or pro-government groups. There's also the possibility that none of the parties on the ballot paper will be able to form a government on its own and a coalition will be necessary. Close watchers of Georgian politics say Saturday's election is a pivotal moment for a country that, like other former Soviet republics, has found itself pulled between a future aligned with Russia or the West, and where political polarization has become pronounced. ""All sides agree the upcoming elections are a critical moment for Georgia's future,"" Ketevan Chachava, non-resident fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said in commentary earlier this month. ""The governing Georgian Dream Party's rhetoric toward the West — its founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, calls the West the ""party of war"" and says it forced Georgia and Russia into confrontation — has alarmed pro-European groups, international partners and observers, highlighting a broader struggle between pro-European and pro-Russian forces,"" she noted.

The Georgian Dream-led government has enacted various policies of late that have gone against the grain of its previous ambitions to join NATO and the European Union and have instead aligned it with Moscow, with the introduction of what critics and opposition parties decry as repressive laws stifling media freedoms, civil society and the rights of sexual minorities. The introduction of a Russia-style law on foreign influence in May — and a brutal police crackdown on subsequent protests at the bill — was particularly contentious, and seen as the most obvious example of Georgian Dream's slide toward a Kremlin-like style of governance. The government has since doubled down on perceived Western influences in domestic politics, saying it would seek to ban all pro-Western opposition groups if it secures a constitutional majority in this weekend's election. Despite its increasingly anti-Western rhetoric, Georgian Dream insists it still wants Georgia to join the EU and its election posters feature the party's logo along with the symbol of the EU.

The party's founder and de facto leader, the billionaire oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, has said the country should only become a member of the EU ""through dignity,"" and must not go to war with or sanction Russia, or harm its economy in the process. Polls suggest the majority, around 80%, of Georgia's population support membership of the EU, with around 67% supporting membership of NATO, putting a significant proportion of Georgia's 3.8 million people at odds with a government that has appeared to turn its back on those aspirations.

Critical vote

The Georgian government's perceived backtracking on human rights and democratic principles have put it in direct conflict with Washington and the EU, which have imposed sanctions on Georgian officials, and put Tbilisi's EU accession talks and funding on ice as a result. It's a rapid fall from grace as Georgia only obtained EU candidate status in December 2023. European lawmakers warned this month that ""democracy is at risk"" in Georgia, and have told Georgian Dream it must ""roll back undemocratic legislation in order to make progress in its relations with the EU,"" a statement from the European Parliament earlier in October noted.

European lawmakers see the upcoming parliamentary elections as ""decisive in determining Georgia's future democratic development and geopolitical choice"" and its ability to make progress on its EU member state candidacy, the European Parliament noted. Analysts have widely described Georgia's election as a referendum ""for or against Europe,"" but it could also be viewed as a vote for or against remaining within Russia's sphere of influence and closer geopolitical and economic relations with Moscow. The specter of Georgia's former Soviet overlord certainly looms large over the vote, with Moscow seen to have exerted a stronger influence over the ruling Georgian Dream party in recent years, and particularly since it launched its invasion of fellow former Soviet republic and pro-Western Ukraine in February 2022. Georgian Dream refrained from joining Western and international sanctions against Russia after the war began and founder Ivanishvili has pitched the election as a choice between peace and war, casting the West as a ""Global War Party"" that would suck Georgia into a conflict with Russia, as he said it had done with Ukraine.

Moscow will be watching the outcome closely, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted Monday, noting that the Kremlin intends to leverage any Russia-friendly Georgian government ""to enhance strategic Russian interests and Moscow's geopolitical objectives of asserting control over Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia."" ""The election outcome will likely determine whether Georgia abandons its longstanding policy of aligning with the West and instead deepens economic and political ties with the Kremlin in line with the pro-Kremlin positions the ruling Georgian Dream party has increasingly taken,"" the ISW noted.

Polarization

Georgian Dream and pro-EU groups have both looked to rally supporters ahead of the vote, holding rallies in the capital Tbilisi in the last week. Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili, staunchly critical of the ruling party, addressed crowds of supporters last weekend, telling them that the vote would ""demonstrate people's will for freedom, independence, and a European future."" ""Here today is the society, the people, the Georgians who are going to Europe,"" Zourabichvili told the crowd, many of whom were draped in EU and Georgian flags.

"Trump taps Lee Zeldin as EPA chief, Rep. Elise Stefanik for UN ambassador","Former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump reacts as former U.S. Representative Lee Zeldin speaks at a rally ahead of the New Hampshire primary election in Concord, New Hampshire, U.S. January 19, 2024. Elizabeth Frantz | Reuters

President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that he would appoint former Rep. Lee Zeldin as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and current Rep. Elise Stefanik as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Both Zeldin and Stefanik are Republicans from New York. Trump said that Zeldin, an attorney who represented a Long Island congressional district for four terms, ""has been a true fighter for America First policies."" ""He will ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses, while at the same time maintaining the highest environmental standards, including the cleanest air and water on the planet,"" Trump said in a statement.

Zeldin, 44, in a tweet wrote that ""it is an honor to join President Trump's Cabinet as EPA Administrator."" ""We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI,"" Zeldin wrote. ""We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water."" Zeldin was the Republican Party's nominee for governor of New York in 2022, when he was defeated by incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul. Right after Trump announced he would lead the EPA, Zeldin told Fox News, ""So day one and the first 100 days, we have the opportunity to roll back regulations that are forcing businesses to be able to struggle."" ""There are regulations that the left wing of this country have been advocating through regulatory power that ends up causing businesses to go in the wrong direction,"" he said. Zeldin has an extremely low lifetime rating score — 14% — from the League of Conservation Voters, for his many votes in the House of Representatives that were considered ""anti-environment"" by that group. The executive director of the Sierra Club, a leading environmental group, blasted Trump's selection of Zeldin for the EPA post. ""Naming an unqualified, anti-American worker who opposes efforts to safeguard our clean air and water lays bare Donald Trump's intentions to, once again, sell our health, our communities, our jobs, and our future out to corporate polluters,"" said Executive Director Ben Jealous. ""Our lives, our livelihoods, and our collective future cannot afford Lee Zeldin — or anyone who seeks to carry out a mission antithetical to the EPA's mission.""

Meta extends ban on new political ads past Election Day,"Meta's Mark Zuckerberg plans to visit South Korea, scheduling key meetings during the trip, according to a statement by Meta on Wednesday, which did not provide further details. Reportedly, Zuckerberg is anticipated to meet with Samsung Electronics chairman Jay Y. Lee later this month to discuss AI chip supply and other generative AI issues, as per the South Korean newspaper Seoul Economic Daily, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

Meta extended its ban on new political ads on Facebook and Instagram past Election Day in the U.S.

The social media giant announced the political ads policy update on Monday, extending its ban on new political ads past Tuesday, the original end date for the restriction period.

Meta did not specify the day it will lift the restriction, saying only that the ad blocking will continue ""until later this week."" The company did not say why it extended the political advertising restriction period.

The company announced in August that any political ads that ran at least once before Oct. 29 would still be allowed to run on Meta's services in the final week before Election Day. Other political ads will not be allowed to run.

Organization with eligible ads will have ""limited editing capabilities"" while the restriction is still in place, Meta said. Those advertisers will be allowed to make scheduling, budgeting and bidding-related changes to their political ads, Meta said.

Meta enacted the same policy in 2020. The company said the policy is in place because ""we recognize there may not be enough time to contest new claims made in ads.""

Google-parent Alphabet announced a similar ad policy update last month, saying it would pause ads relating to U.S. elections from running in the U.S. after the last polls close on Tuesday. Alphabet said it would notify advertisers when it lifts the pause.

Nearly $1 billion has been spent on political ads over the last week, with the bulk of the money spent on down-ballot races throughout the U.S., according to data from advertising analytics firm AdImpact.

Trump and Harris vie for the Latino vote on eve of election,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned around southwestern states this week as they sought to shore up the Latino vote with only five days until Election Day.

Latino voters account for %14.7 of all eligible voters in the upcoming election, according to Pew Research Center. New Mexico, where Trump campaigned on Thursday, has the highest share of Latino voters with around 45% the population. The states with the next largest share of Latino voters include California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada. While California is reliably blue and Texas reliably red, Arizona and Nevada, where Harris held her rallies, are battleground swing states.

Although Democrats tend to have a historical advantage among Latino voters, that advantage has declined over the past four presidential cycles, according to a national NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll from September, especially as Trump makes strides with Latino men. One of the big reasons behind this, according to experts, is inflation and the cost of living crisis, two issues on which voters tend to trust Trump over Harris.

""So I'm here for one simple reason. I like you very much, and it's good for my credentials with the Hispanic or Latino community,"" Trump told the crowd in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Thursday, before asking them not to make him ""waste a whole damn half a day here.""

The state is blue-leaning; President Joe Biden won in 2020 by 10.8 points and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won by 8.3 points in 2016. But Trump thinks he can shift it,

""We almost won it twice, and let me tell you, I believe we won it twice,"" Trump said of the results of the presidential election out of New Mexico in 2020 and 2016, suggesting that the votes were rigged and that he believes he can win the state this year.

""One of the biggest reasons we will win this state is that you have among the worst border problems of any state in America, and I am the only one that knows how to fix it,"" Trump said.

But the Trump campaign also found itself in the middle of a controversy this past week that could dampen his support among Latino voters, when comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made racist remarks about Latinos at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally.

Hinchcliffe joked that Latinos ""love making babies"" and he called Puerto Rico ""a floating island of garbage."" And while campaign officials were quick to distance Trump from these remarks, the former President himself has yet to personally apologize for them.",Nov 1 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/trump-harris-latino-vote-election.html

Private prison stocks rose Monday after President-elect Donald Trump selected immigration hardliner Tom Homan as his ""border czar."" The Geo Group and CoreCivic jumped more than 4% and more than 6%, respectively. Homan served as the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first term.

Homan told a conservative conference in July that he ""will run the biggest deportation operation this country has ever seen"" when Trump returns to office.

"rump ‘most likely’ needs 60 votes in Senate to enact tariff plan, Sen. Rick Scott suggests","President-elect Donald Trump proposed sweeping new tariffs while on the campaign trail. The self-proclaimed ""Tariff Man"" has said he could impose such levies on U.S. imports without Congress' approval.

There's debate among economists and other experts as to whether he could do so.

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. — one of three lawmakers vying to succeed Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-KY, as Senate majority leader — suggested Sunday that Trump would probably need Congress' help.

""The tariffs, that most likely is going to require 60 [votes in the Senate] unless there's some way we can get that done through reciliation with 51 [votes],"" Scott said on Fox News ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

Reconciliation is a way to pass tax and spending bills with a simple majority in the Senate. It avoids a filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome.

Control of the House of Representatives, which would need to pass such legislation, remains unclear.

A tariff is a tax on imported goods that is generally passed along to the consumer. Trump has vowed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports arriving into the United States and at least a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.

He's proposed others, too, such as a tariff of at least 200% on vehicles from Mexico, and a similar amount on the company Deere & Co. if it were to shift some production from the U.S. to Mexico.

Economic experts dispute whether Trump's tariff plan, especially the tax on global imports, can be done via executive action.

Alan Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, wrote in September that ""Trump doesn't have the authority to do this.""

However, Trump could ""assert national security"" or use ""a lot of different things in the law"" to potentially impose across-the-board tariffs, Jason Furman, a Harvard University professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration, told CNBC.

""Although,"" he added, ""it would all end up in court.""",Nov 10 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/10/trump-most-likely-needs-60-votes-in-senate-to-enact-tariff-plan-sen-rick-scott-suggests.html
Shock poll shows Harris leading Trump in Iowa," Democratic presidential nominee and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a ""When We Vote We Win"" campaign rally at Craig Ranch Amphitheater on October 31, 2024 in North Las Vegas, Nevada.

Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in Iowa by 47% to 44% among likely voters, according to a shocking new poll released Saturday night, just three days before Election Day.

Harris' advantage is within the poll's 3.4 percentage point margin of error, but her lead reflects a 7-point swing by voters in her favor since September.

The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll's results came as a complete surprise to political observers, as no serious analyst has predicted that the Democratic nominee will defeat Trump in the state.

Neither candidate had campaigned in the state, which Trump has easily won in the past two presidential elections, since the presidential primaries concluded.

""It's hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,"" pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co told the Des Moines Register.

""She has clearly leaped into a leading position.""

Selzer & Co. conducted the survey of 808 likely voters in Iowa from Monday to Thursday. Selzer's company is highly respected by pollsters and her findings typically carry significant weight with political strategists.

Harris' lead in the poll was powered by strong support from female voters, particularly older and politically independent ones.",Nov 2 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/02/harris-leading-trump-iowa-poll-presidential-election-.html

Georgia's ruling Georgian Dream party received more than 54% of the vote in a parliamentary election on Saturday, with more than 99% of precincts counted, the electoral commission said on Sunday. The result is a blow to pro-Western Georgians, who had cast the election as a choice between a ruling party that has deepened ties with Russia and an opposition that had hoped to fast-track integration with the European Union. ISFED, a Georgian election monitoring group, said that it had registered violations including ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation and bribery that could have had an impact on the results. It said that it had not seen significant violations in the counting of votes, most of which were cast electronically.

The electoral commission and Georgian Dream party did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the allegations, but on Saturday both hailed a free and fair election. Georgian Dream is expected to comment on the matter later on Sunday morning. The country's four main opposition parties said that they do not recognise the results, with one opposition leader calling the results ""a constitutional coup"". But Georgian Dream's reclusive billionaire founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, who had campaigned heavily on keeping Georgia out of the war in Ukraine, claimed success on Saturday night, with his party putting in its strongest performance since 2012 on the back of huge margins of up to 90% in some rural areas. ""It is a rare case in the world that the same party achieves such success in such a difficult situation - this is a good indicator of the talent of the Georgian people,"" Ivanishvili told cheering supporters on Saturday night. Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream says it wants Georgia to join the European Union, though Brussels says the country's membership application is frozen over what it says is Georgian Dream's authoritarian tendencies.

The personal is getting political. One week before Election Day, Democrats are spending big to target swing-state voters in nail salons, lifestyle magazines and shopping malls — all places where they might normally seek to escape the news. The Democratic National Committee's seven-figure ad buy aims to reach tens of millions of voters in key demographics with what could be the last get-out-the-vote message they hear before Nov. 5.

The latest ""I Will Vote"" campaign, launched Tuesday, will feature digital ad placements in over 40 publications, ranging from Oprah Winfrey's O magazine and Women's Health, to Serious Eats and the fashion blog Hypebeast. The final push is focused on voters in the seven key battleground states likely to decide the election between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. The tone of the ads will be tailored from market to market to appeal to different audiences. One of them, featuring a kitten looking out from behind a ballot box, references the infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women's genitals. Another evokes the look of a military recruitment poster: ""Be a patriot,"" it says in all caps. ""Stop the fascists.""

Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards A DNC advertisement.

The DNC is also buying ""takeovers"" of the digital homepages of Teen Vogue, Glamour, Vogue and Good Housekeeping, as well as audio ads that will air across Spotify, iHeart Media and Pandora. Swing-state voters have already been pummeled with political commercials — but nowhere more so than in Pennsylvania, which has seen the most ad spending of the election cycle by far. That deluge isn't letting up: As of Friday, advertisers have plunked more than $65 million on future presidential ad reservations in the Keystone State alone, according to AdImpact.

In hopes of cutting through the noise, the DNC is deploying ""tailored advertising that meets Americans where they are,"" the group's acting co-executive director Monica Guardiola said in a statement. ""Now through Election Day, as voters turn to the sources they trust most for news, culture, entertainment, and leisure, they will be met with Democrats' message of freedom,"" she said. That message will be delivered in some less-traditional places, including nail salons, malls, transit centers and grocery stores. Most of the ads show Democrats leaning into the issue of reproductive rights, an issue on which the party can both mobilize its base, and potentially win over independent and moderate Republican women. ""Women will decide this election. Your daughters shouldn't have fewer rights than your mother did,"" one ad reads. Another, featuring bubble-letter font against a pink-and-orange-checkered background, declares, ""Your vote matters. Period."" To ensure the point lands, the ad also depicts a sparkling intrauterine device, or IUD.

U.S. finalizes $6.6 billion chips award for TSMC ahead of Trump return,"A logo of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is seen during the TSMC global RnD Center opening ceremony in Hsinchu on July 28, 2023. (Photo by Amber Wang / AFP)

The U.S. Commerce Department said Friday it has finalized a $6.6 billion government subsidy for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's U.S. unit for semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona.

The binding contract - after a preliminary agreement announced in April - is the first major award to be completed under the $52.7 billion program created in 2022.

It comes just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized the program, takes office.

In April, TSMC agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona fab by 2030.

The Taiwanese company will produce the world's most advanced 2 nanometer technology at its second Arizona fab expected to begin production in 2028. TSMC also agreed to use its most advanced chip manufacturing technology called ""A16"" in Arizona.

""When we started this there were a lot of naysayers who said maybe TSMC will do 5 or 6 nanometer in the United States,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview. ""Actually they are doing their most sophisticated chips in the United States.""

The TSMC award also includes up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans. Under the agreement, TSMC will receive cash as it meets project milestones. Commerce expects to release at least $1 billion to TSMC by year end, a senior official told reporters.

TSMC agreed to forgo stock buybacks for five years - subject to some exceptions - and share any excess profits with the U.S. government under an ""upside sharing agreement.""",Nov 15 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/15/us-finalizes-6point6-billion-chips-award-for-tsmc-ahead-of-trump-return.html

Google curbs politics discussion among employees on U.S. Election Day,"Google has been moderating and removing employees' internal election-related conversations, CNBC has learned.

Ahead of Tuesday's U.S. elections, Google executives warned employees to keep political opinions and statements away from a popular internal discussion forum called Memegen, according to correspondence viewed by CNBC. Despite the warnings, employees continued posting memes related to the election and criticizing the company's policies on Tuesday.

The most recent leadership guidance shows the company is taking expanded action to temper internal political discussions. Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Monday sent a memo reminding employees that people turn to the company's services for ""high-quality and reliable information."" That includes through the company's Google Search, Google News and YouTube services.

""Whomever the voters entrust, let's remember the role we play at work, through the products we build and as a business: to be a trusted source of information to people of every background and belief,"" Pichai wrote. ""We will and must maintain that.""

As one of the most important tech leaders in the U.S., Pichai himself has been pulled into the broader political discussions of late. Republican nominee Donald Trump claimed to have multiple phone calls with Pichai in recent weeks.

Google has been cracking down on internal conversations since 2019 when the company introduced a policy barring employees from making statements that ""insult, demean, or humiliate"" their colleagues. The rules also discouraged employees from engaging in a ""raging debate over politics or the latest news story.""

That policy signaled a significant culture shift for the company. Some employees pushed back against the restrictions, saying they were too broad, and in 2020, the company said it was expanding its internal content moderation practices, requiring employees to more actively moderate internal discussions, CNBC found at the time.

Since 2021, Google has dealt with internal dissent regarding Project Nimbus, which is a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon to provide the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Google briefly shut down an internal message board this March after employees posted comments about the company's Nimbus contract.

In a 2019 settlement, the U.S. National Labor Board ordered Google to post a list of employee rights at its headquarters that included the right to discuss workplace conditions. That came after a former Google employee filed a complaint alleging that the company restricted free speech and fired him for expressing conservative views, which Google refuted.

"Some voters retain optimism for a woman president following Trump's win: 'Americans are ready, it just wasn't meant to be Harris'","A woman completes her ballot for the 2024 U.S. presidential election at a polling booth in Fairfax, Virginia on November 5, 2024.

For the second time in U.S. history, a major party nominated a woman for President, and for the second time, she came up short. Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election echoed Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016. Many women saw the opportunity of having the first woman president as a powerful signal of women's advancement in leadership and society, and now question what the loss means and what role gender may have played. But the idea of electing the first female president didn't strongly motivate people to turn out. Only 10% of voters called the historic potential of the Harris campaign the most important factor in their decision, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide between Oct. 28 and Nov. 5. An additional 25% considered it an important factor but not decisive. Still, Harris captured 48.1% of the over 140 million votes Americans cast in 2024, according to NBC News.

While many Harris supporters are saddened by the result and concerned about what her experience means for future female candidates, a range of political analysts, academics, and U.S. women CNBC Make It spoke to remain cautiously optimistic. They don't expect that America will have to wait much longer for a female president.

'I think a woman could do a great job as president. I don't think she is the right woman'

The results of this year's election shouldn't be understood to mean that Americans don't ever want a female president, says NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Ali Vitali, author of the 2022 book ""Electable: Why America Hasn't Put a Woman in the White House … Yet."" The compressed timeline of Harris's campaign — and her association with President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have long been underwater — didn't help to convince voters that she was the right candidate for the job. ""Many Americans didn't know who Harris was heading into the election, and if they did, they just knew her as the vice president of Joe Biden, an unpopular incumbent,"" adds Vitali. ""Forming your own political identity is so important for any candidate, whether you're a woman or not,"" Vitali continues. ""Harris only had 107 days to run a successful campaign."" Close to 30% of voters said they wanted a major overhaul in how the country is run, according to AP VoteCast.



As one of the first Gen Z women to hold public office in the U.S., 26-year-old Bushra Amiwala of Chicago would love to see more female representation in government. But even she was conflicted. ""I voted for Vice President Harris, but there was so much pause in that decision — I debated it for weeks,"" she says. Amiwala felt indecisive about Harris in part because ""she's been part of the same administration that's been involved in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and as a Muslim American, that's an important issue to me,"" she says. Harris' loss has not diminished Amiwala's optimism that the U.S. could elect its first female president soon. ""I think Americans are ready for a woman president, it just wasn't meant to be Harris,"" Amiwala says. ""I'm excited to see what the 2028 election holds.""

Trump voter JoyAnna Chabaka, a 48-year-old real estate broker in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, saw the President-elect as a strong leader and family man. She hopes to see a woman in the White House; she just didn't believe Harris was the right candidate. ""I think a woman could do a great job as president. I don't think she is the right woman,"" she says. ""I really wanted to support [Harris], especially as someone who is also biracial,"" she adds. But the Harris campaign's messaging around the vice president's race and identity felt inauthentic. ""That's where she lost me,"" Chabaka says. ""She might have had a good message [in the campaign], but I think it got lost in some of the culture or identity politics her team used."" ""Something I also struggled with, too, is that she wasn't a mom,"" Chabaka continues. ""I didn't feel like she understood what it was like being a parent in this economy under her administration.""

'People still don't trust us to lead'

A wealth of research shows that women leaders — especially those who compete at the highest echelons of political power — have to walk a tightrope. If they make traditional displays of power, they may be labeled as too direct or aggressive. If they appear agreeable and friendly, they can be denigrated as weak, lightweight, and incompetent. For Harris, a woman of color, the tightrope was even thinner, Vitali says: Harris had to face both racist and sexist tropes throughout the election. ""Some people didn't vote for Harris for her politics, or because they were frustrated with Biden,"" Vitali says. ""But at the same time, some voters might not even be able to recognize their unconscious bias around not voting for a woman, specifically a woman of color."" Natasha Bowman, a 46-year-old human resources executive in New York, theorizes that Harris' identity as a Black and South Asian woman played a role in her defeat. As a Black woman herself, Bowman says she has to work ""twice as hard for half the recognition."" ""What Harris' loss reaffirmed to me is that you can have a woman of color with a flawless resume, and people will still think she's less qualified than a white man with a criminal record, simply because of her gender and the color of her skin,"" she says. ""The millions of people that voted for Trump sent a very clear message: They want a country that is male-centered and white-centered."" Alejandra Toro, a 29-year-old project manager from Charlotte, North Carolina, felt similar heartache. The morning after the election, Toro sat down at her makeup table to film a ""get ready with me"" TikTok video, as she does every day, through tears. She decided to post it, hoping it would comfort other disheartened women. Within hours, her video garnered more than 4 million views. ""If Harris — smart, well-spoken, and experienced — wasn't 'qualified' enough, who is?"" Toro tells CNBC Make It. ""As a woman of color, it's disheartening, it almost feels like people still don't trust us to lead.""

'Maybe a Republican woman would see greater success'

Sexism was a small but significant factor that worked against Harris, according to Laura Kray, a psychologist and director of the Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership at UC Berkley's Haas School of Business. ""When people think of the most powerful men in the world, whether it be CEOs or those in political office, it's men who control resources, whereas the most powerful women tend to have less actual power and more social status,"" Kray says. She points to the Harris campaign's active presence on TikTok and the endorsements she received from celebrities with huge, devoted fan bases like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. While Americans may support women's advancement in principle, ""the outcome of the election suggests, to me, that our society remains more comfortable with women in supporting roles rather than the primary decision-makers, or controlling resources.""

Georgia judge blocks rule requiring counties to hand-count Election Day ballots,"People visit an early voting location during midterm U.S. Congressional and state governor elections at the Smyrna Community Center in Smyrna, Georgia, November 3, 2022.

A Georgia judge on Tuesday blocked a new rule from the state's election board that would have required counties to count ballots cast on Election Day by hand, a provision critics had said would cause delays and disruptions in reporting results in the battleground state.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his decision that the rule would be implemented too close to the election and that it would cause ""administrative chaos"" given the limited time available to train poll workers.

""[T]he public interest is not disserved by pressing pause here. This election season is fraught; memories of January 6 have not faded away, regardless of one's view of that date's fame or infamy,"" he wrote. ""Anything that adds uncertainty and disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.""

The temporary injunction, which is likely to be appealed, is a win for Democrats who filed the suit after the State Election Board voted 3-2 in favor of the hand-counting rule last month. It was set to take effect on Oct. 22, two weeks out from Election Day.

The rule required election workers to count the number of ballots — not every vote on a ballot — cast on Nov. 5 before they are delivered to the county for counting and tabulation, sparking concerns it could unnecessarily delay the reporting of results and sow uncertainty in a key state in the presidential election.

It was approved by three board members who've been praised by former President Donald Trump, and it was opposed by Democrats in the state, as well as by the Republican secretary of state and attorney general.

Days after the vote, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia, with support from Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, sued in a Fulton County court, seeking to halt the new rule from going into effect.

Democrats praised Tuesday's injunction.

""From the beginning, this rule was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome, and our democracy is stronger thanks to this decision to block it. We will continue fighting to ensure that voters can cast their ballot knowing it will count,"" Harris principal deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks, DNC acting co-director Monica Guardiola and Rep. Nikema Williams, chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia, said in a joint statement.

Hand-counting ballots has captured the attention of many on the right in recent years in response to baseless claims about hacked voting machines, despite ample evidence that counting by hand is more expensive and less accurate than using ballot tabulators.

Georgia has been one of the primary focuses of Trump's unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen. He has repeatedly praised the three board members who passed the measure, saying they're ""pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory.""

The three members are Janice Johnston, Rick Jeffares and Janelle King. Johnson was appointed to the board by the state Republican Party, while Jeffares was appointed by the Republican-controlled state Senate and King by the GOP-led state House.

The two members who voted against the measure were appointed by GOP Gov. Brian Kemp and the state Democratic Party.

In August, the same Georgia board members passed other new rules that would allow county election board members to conduct ""reasonable"" inquiries before they certify results.

Critics say that could throw the election into chaos because ""reasonable inquiry"" isn't defined and an individual board member could block certification for any reason. That ruling is the subject of another Democratic-led lawsuit.

McBurney handed Trump allies another defeat Tuesday, ruling that county election boards in Georgia are not allowed to refuse to certify election results.",Oct 16 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/16/georgia-judge-blocks-rule-requiring-counties-to-hand-count-election-day-ballots.html
Here's my playbook for how to invest in stocks during a Trump presidency,"Lots of people are trying to game the incoming Donald Trump administration, repositioning their portfolios to profit from what seems like a pretty sure thing. After all, how many presidents have said that they grade themselves by the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ? How many presidents even bother to follow the stock market? I have been close enough to them to tell you that except for Trump the market has meant nothing to any of them. It's just an abstraction. I remember during Covid times that then-President Trump once called me to apologize. He said he was going to wipe out ""Mad Money"" because he was going to do a nightly Covid broadcast at the same time. We held in. Then when he pulled the plug on it, he congratulated me for winning the time slot. I mean this guy knows business. He's always enjoyed bantering about companies even though he is a real estate executive through and through. But let's be clear: Gaming this president is going to be hard. Figuring out which of my Charitable Trust stocks will benefit the most and which ones could get hurt is a constant work in progress. The Trust portfolio is what we use for the CNBC Investing Club. I want you to understand, though, that a Trump administration is like no other. You may be sitting there watching your portfolio and a tweet will come out — a vicious nasty tweet, maybe it will be on Trump's own platform Truth Social this time — and it can rock your world. Back in April 2018, Trump ruled then-Twitter — now X and under the ownership of Trump efficiency czar Elon Musk . I was on vacation back then with my wife Lisa in the Bahamas. I was just soaking in some warmth and checked in with Jeff Marks , the director of portfolio analysis for my Trust. Jeff told me that Trump had just tweeted that Amazon was ripping off the Post Office with its recent contract, a contract that had been vetted and agreed to, honorably, by both sides. It was something we had looked at quite closely because Amazon was a longtime favorite and we wanted to be sure we were ironclad. The stock had been trending lower in the days before the tweetstorm — knocking shares from $77 each to $72. The tweets came on Saturday, March 31, and the stock dropped more than 5% to $68 and change that Monday. I told Jeff at the time that I had had it. Trump has nothing on Amazon, which did nothing wrong. No court would allow an arms' length contract to be annulled because one side did better than then the other — and by the way, it wasn't even clear that that was the case. I said buy some more Amazon. We did. Then I said buy some more. I was gesticulating wildly poolside, something Lisa thought highly inappropriate. I couldn't believe Trump was eviscerating one of the best companies in the world, Amazon. It was sinking like a block of cement in the deep end. We bought more. We knew the story. Trump knew the bluster, and he ended up with the ""Art of No Deal"" because there was nothing he could do about the Amazon contract other than rant and rave — and all the while giving us better Amazon stock prices to buy all the way down. That's how we got such a fine Amazon basis below $70 for a big slug of what it is now $212 per share, which closed at a record high Wednesday. Trump all along was just bluffing, and when there was no firestorm about it, he just moved on. We moved in. Amazon is currently our third biggest position in the portfolio, with about a 4.5% weighting and an overall cost basis of just over $97 on 750 shares. We had a button back then on my ""Mad Money"" soundboard. It was labeled ""Trump stock"" and a professional announcer, the deep-voice guy we used to use all of the time at the network, recorded it. I pushed the button whenever I was sure that a stock could somehow do well under the first Trump administration. There was no ""Trump Stock,"" ""Trump Stock"" button pressing for Amazon that day. But it was one of the best buys we have ever made. So, I say get ready for some pretty counterintuitive things — some out of left field, a bitter attack or two on a CEO — and consider buying, not selling the stock of a company Trump may hate at the time. He may have forgotten why he hated it a few days later. Remember, the man can change his mind on a dime. Another example: Yes, Trump did threaten Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder CEO of Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms , with life in prison in his book ""Save America,"" which was published in September. It's because Trump thought Zuckerberg plotted against him. But then in a curious interview on a Barstool podcast on Oct. 15, Trump said he likes Zuckerberg much better than he used to. That could be because Zuckerberg's company stayed out of politics this year — and, more importantly, because Zuckerberg said Trump's reaction to the attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania was ""badass."" You call the president-elect a ""badass,"" and you do it in a flattering way, and maybe he will pardon you, too, from life imprisonment. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AMZN, META.

"FBI raids apartment of election betting site Polymarket's CEO and seizes cellphone, source says","The 26-year-old was at home when numerous agents entered his apartment Wednesday and he turned over his devices to authorities, the source said, adding that Coplan has not been arrested or charged. The source said it's not clear if Coplan or Polymarket are targets of an investigation.

The search comes shortly after the company's markets wagered correctly and controversially in Donald Trump's favor in bets for who would win the presidential election, despite opinion polls showing a tight race.

The FBI seized a cellphone and other electronic devices of betting site Polymarket's CEO Shayne Coplan in a raid on his New York City apartment early Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Polymarket, which Coplan founded in 2020, has recently been the subject of intense debate and scrutiny over its creation of election betting markets. The company brought in more than $3.6 billion from bets placed on the presidential election, including $1.5 billion on Trump and $1 billion on Vice President Kamala Harris, according to an NBC News analysis.

Speculation has swirled around the identity of major bettors who wagered on Trump, and whether or not the odds and the existence of the markets could have had an effect on voters.

Though U.S. election betting is newly legal in some circumstances, Polymarket is not supposed to allow U.S. users after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission halted its operations in 2022, but its userbase largely operates through cryptocurrency, which allows for easy anonymity.

Coplan has continuously defended the site as ""nonpartisan,"" blaming the Biden administration and the recent Democratic loss as reasoning for the raid.

""It's discouraging that the current administration would seek a last-ditch effort to go after companies they deem to be associated with political opponents,"" Coplan said on X. ""Polymarket has provided value to 10's of millions of people this election cycle, while causing harm to nobody.""

In a statement, a Polymarket spokesperson said to NBC News, ""This is obvious political retribution by the outgoing administration against Polymarket for providing a market that correctly called the 2024 presidential election. Polymarket is a fully transparent prediction market that helps everyday people better understand the events that matter most to them, including elections. We charge no fees, take no trading positions, and allow observers from around the world to analyze all market data as a public good. We look forward to standing up for ourselves and our community and continuing to help everyday people understand important world events.""

Elon Musk ordered to attend $1 million voter lottery suit hearing in Philadelphia court,"Elon Musk wears a black ""Make America Great Again"" cap while attending a campaign rally with Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 5, 2024.

Elon Musk must attend an emergency court hearing in Philadelphia on Thursday morning to address a bid by the city's top prosecutor to stop the Tesla CEO and his political action committee from continuing to award $1 million prizes to registered voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, a judge ordered Wednesday.

Also on Wednesday, attorneys for Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner revealed in a court filing that his lawsuit against Musk, who is an ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and the America PAC had ""triggered an avalanche of [social media] posts from Musk's followers,"" many of whom ""made antisemitic attacks on Krasner.""

After Krasner filed his suit Monday, Musk in a post on his social media site X noted his agreement with a user's claim that the district attorney knows the $1 million daily giveaway is ""not illegal but wants a leftist judge to stop it before Election Day,"" the lawyers for the DA wrote.

Krasner's lawyers asked Judge Angelo Foglietta to order enhanced security for the hearing — originally scheduled for Friday morning — noting that one X account had posted the prosecutor's home address and wrote, ""Krasner loves visitors. Mask up and leave all cellphones at home.""

The attorneys also asked Foglietta for an order that ""requires attendance of all of the parties, i.e., DA Krasner, a representative of America PAC and Mr. Musk.""

Hours after that filing, Foglietta moved up the hearing to be held in City Hall one a day, to Thursday morning.

""All parties must be present at the time of the hearing,"" Foglietta wrote in the order in Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas.

Krasner's lawsuit accuses Musk and America PAC of operating an illegal lottery and trying to influence voters in the presidential election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Trump.

Musk and attorneys for him and his PAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

In his lawsuit, Krasner's lawyers wrote that the lottery was ""deceptive,"" to consumers since America PAC had not published clear lottery rules, or said how it would protect participants' personal information.

The suit also argues that although ""Musk says that a winner's selection is 'random,' that appears false because multiple winners that have been selected are individuals who have shown up at Trump rallies in Pennsylvania.""

The posts on X containing information about Krasner's address had been removed from the platform as of Wednesday afternoon.

Lora KolodnyWhen asked about the removal of the posts, without a suspension of the user's account, X referred CNBC to its policy regarding sharing personal information on the platform.",Oct 30 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/elon-musk-ordered-to-attend-1-million-voter-lottery-suit-hearing-in-philadelphia.html
Trump sued by Central Park Five for defamation over claims made during Harris debate,"Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a campaign rally at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre on October 15, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Five men who were wrongfully convicted as teenagers in the so-called Central Park Five jogger rape case sued Donald Trump on Monday, saying the Republican presidential nominee defamed them by falsely claiming they killed someone and pleaded guilty.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, cites several statements Trump made about the men during his Sept. 10 debate with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, after she blasted Trump for taking out an ad in 1989 calling for the then-teen defendants to be executed.

""Defendant Trump falsely stated [at the debate] that Plaintiffs killed an individual and pled guilty to the crime. These statements are demonstrably false,"" the civil suit said.

""Plaintiffs never pled guilty to any crime and were subsequently cleared of all wrongdoing. Further, the victims of the Central Park assaults were not killed,"" the complaint said.

The suit alleges that Trump's conduct toward the men at the debate ""was part of a continuing pattern of extreme and outrageous conduct dating back several years, thus constituting a continuing tort.""

The plaintiffs in the case, who now refer to themselves as the Exonerated Five, are Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron Brown and Korey Wise. Salaam is a member of the New York City Council.

Their suit, which alleges claims of defamation, false light and intentional infliction of emotional distress, requests damages of more than $75,000, with total compensatory and punitive damages to be determined at trial.

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung, in a statement provided by the campaign, said, ""This is just another frivolous, Election Interference lawsuit, filed by desperate left-wing activists, in an attempt to distract the American people from Kamala Harris's dangerously liberal agenda and failing campaign.""

""The frantic lawfare efforts by Lyin' Kamala's allies to interfere in the election are going nowhere and President Trump is dominating as he marches to a historic win for the American people on November 5th,"" Cheung said.",Oct 21 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/21/trump-central-park-5-defamation-suit-election.html

Stacey Williams goes public with her allegations against Donald Trump,"Donald Trump at his wedding in 1993 (L) and Model Stacey Williams (R) stands at a Sports Illustrated promotional event January 23, 1996 in New York City.

""I feel very comfortable and ready to tell it,"" Williams told NBC News, ""and then I can handle the backlash.""

Epstein pled guilty in 2008 to a state charge of procuring a minor for prostitution and served time in jail in Florida. He died by suicide in 2019 in a federal jail in Manhattan as he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking minors.

Williams appears to be the first person to publicly allege sexual misconduct by Trump in which Epstein played a role. None of the dozens of women in Epstein's orbit whom NBC News has interviewed over the last seven years have accused Trump of misconduct that involved Epstein.

NBC News spoke to seven people who said they discussed the allegations with Williams between 2006 and 2022. All of them said they found Williams and her claim to be credible and consistent. Her allegation was first published in The Guardian and first broadcast by CNN .

Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt flatly denied Williams' allegation in a statement. ""These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris Campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false,"" the statement said in part.

In an interview with NBC News on Wednesday, Williams said her decision to come forward was not made in conjunction with the Democratic Party. Asked whether she had had any communications with Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, she said, ""None whatsoever.""

""I figured it was time to share this, and I'm ready to win this election,"" Williams said on the Zoom call. ""The thought of that monster being back in the White House is my absolute worst nightmare.""

She said on the Zoom call, ""We went to Trump Tower and went up the elevator, and moments later, Trump was greeting us.""

Within moments of meeting him, Trump ""pulled me into him and started groping me. He put his hands all over my breasts and my waist, butt and I froze,"" Williams said on the Zoom call, her voice seeming to crack as she described being touched. ""And I froze because I was so deeply confused about what was happening because the hands were moving all over me.""

Williams said that, as Trump groped her, the two men spoke calmly with each other.

""These two men were, like, smiling at one another and continuing on in their conversation,"" she said.

Williams told NBC News that the two men spoke about her ""as an object."" She said they focused on her looks and her appearances in Sports Illustrated in a conversation she said was ""gross."" She said that the entire incident lasted five to 10 minutes and that it happened in a reception area outside Trump's office.

Williams said that after the encounter, when she and Epstein were back out on the street, Epstein became furious and began ""berating"" her with questions. ""Why did you let him do that?"" he asked, according to Williams. The fact that Epstein blamed her disoriented her, Williams said.

""He made me feel so disgusting and, I remember, at that moment so utterly confused,"" Williams recalled. ""I felt so humiliated and so sick to my stomach and so upset.""

She added, ""I was someone who really prided myself as being one of the tough models who was kind of problematic because I fought back against the predators of the industry.""

""And then the next, probably the next, sensation that I remember was just shame and embarrassment,"" she said. ""I had allowed something to happen that I could have stopped.""

Williams and Epstein never discussed the incident again, she said. Williams was deeply troubled and cut off contact with Epstein shortly afterward. She said she had no awareness that Epstein had abused young women and broken the law until media reports about him emerged.

Days after the incident, a postcard arrived at her modeling agency addressed to her, Williams recalled. It had Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on the front and what appeared to be a handwritten message from him on the back. Williams said she still has the postcard, and she shared photographs with NBC News.

""Stacey, your home away from home, Love Donald"" was written on the back, in handwriting that appears similar to Trump's. The postcard is not postmarked or dated.

""I had a lot of shame, and I blamed myself for it. And that made me not want to talk about it,"" Williams said.

She added that she never considered reporting the allegations to the police. She said she never encountered Trump again.

NBC News spoke to seven people who said Williams previously told them about the alleged encounter with Trump, most of whom requested anonymity. Six were longtime friends and acquaintances. The first was told in 2006, another was told before Trump was a presidential candidate, and the most recent was told in 2022.

Ally Gutwillinger, a friend, said Williams told her the week after Trump announced his presidential campaign in 2015 that she had been groped by Trump with Epstein present.

""I remember it clearly. I was in her house,"" Gutwillinger told NBC News. ""I saw the postcard of Mar-a-Lago sitting there. And she told me to turn it over. And it said, 'Stacey, your home away from home. Love Donald.'""

Judge threatens to hold Rudy Giuliani in contempt if he fails to surrender property in defamation case,"Rudy Giuliani (C) arrives at the New York court following a judge's order compelling his appearance in the defamation case filed by Georgia election workers in New York, United States on November 07, 2024.

A New York federal judge on Thursday threatened to hold former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court if he fails to surrender personal property — including luxury watches, baseball memorabilia, and a 1980 Mercedes-Benz — to satisfy at least some of a $146 million defamation verdict in favor of two Georgia election workers.

Judge Lewis Liman chided Giuliani's lawyer Kenneth Caruso for suggesting the former New York mayor does not know where some of that property is.

""The notion that your client doesn't know where his assets are is farcical,"" Liman said at a hearing in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

""All the property must be turned over to the receiver and if not, I will hold him in contempt,"" the judge told Caruso, whose client was by turns angry, animated and frustrated during the proceeding.

Liman gave lawyers for the two plaintiffs in the case, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea Moss, until Monday to tell Giuliani's lawyer where to deliver the items and how to do so.

The women's attorney, Aaron Nathan, earlier this week in a court filing told Liman that Giuliani had emptied his multi-million-dollar Manhattan apartment — which is also due to be forfeited to the women — of items that were subject to the forfeiture.

Nathan said Giuliani has stonewalled his efforts to learn where the items are.

""The vast majority of physical property, we have no idea where it is,"" Nathan said at Thursday's hearing. ""There has been nothing but game playing.""

Giuliani said the items are in his homes in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, and in a storage facility in Ronkonkoma, Long Island, to which he claims he has no access.

Nathan alleged that Giuliani has opened secret bank accounts and created limited liability companies on the heels of the defamation verdict last year.

Before he entered court Thursday, Giuliani fumed over a judge's order that he show up in person, saying it is ""like a political persecution.""

Giuliani was found liable in federal court in Washington, D.C., for defaming the two women by claiming they had committed ballot fraud at a vote-counting site during the 2020 presidential election, when he was representing President-elect Donald Trump. He was ordered to pay them $146 million in the case.",Nov 7 2024,CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/rudy-giuliani-responds-to-election-workers-claims-on-assets.html
Health care fraudster Philip Esformes is latest Trump clemency recipient to be arrested," Philip Esformes, whose 20-year prison sentence for a massive, $1.3 billion Medicare fraud scheme was commuted in 2020 by then-President Donald Trump, was arrested over the weekend in Florida on domestic-violence related charges.

Esformes is at least the seventh person who received executive clemency from Trump, and has since been charged with new crimes, according to The New York Times, which first reported this latest arrest.

In August, a convicted New York drug dealer and predatory lender named Jonathan Braun, whose 10-year prison term Trump commuted in 2021, was charged with assaulting his father-in-law and his wife in separate incidents.

Court records show that Esformes was arrested Saturday and then charged with tampering with a victim or witness, and with criminal mischief involving property damage.

He was booked into the Miami-Dade County jail on Sunday, his 56th birthday.

Esformes was released on Monday after posting two separate bonds totaling $1,650, according to a jail spokeswoman.

A lawyer for Esformes had no immediate comment on the arrest.

CNBC has requested comment from Trump's presidential campaign spokesman.

CNBC also has requested comment from a lawyer for Esformes' ex-wife, Sherri Beth Esformes, whose divorce from him was finalized in July 2020.

Sherri Beth Esformes filed a petition in her ex-husband's federal health care fraud case in August, asserting a 50% property interest in a slew of companies and properties that were deemed forfeitable by Philip Esformes to settle a $38.7 million forfeiture judgment in that case.

A lawyer for Sherri Beth wrote that he legal right to the properties is superior to the interest of the U.S. government in the assets, and that it renders the forfeiture order invalid.

The filing says that by not including Sherri Beth as the record owner of the properties, her ex-husband ""obtained these properties by a breach of trust of Ms. Esformes' confidence and through fraudulent or unlawful means.""

On Tuesday, a judge in Miami federal court set a deadline of Nov. 4 for Philip Esformes to respond to his ex-wife's filing.
